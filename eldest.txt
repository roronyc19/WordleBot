PROLOGUE:
SHADE OFFEAR
Wind howled through the night, carrying a scent that would change the world. A tall Shade lifted his
head and sniffed the air. He looked human except for his crimson hair and maroon eyes.

He blinked in surprise. The message had been correct: they were here. Or was it a trap? He weighed the
odds, then said icily, “Spread out; hide behind trees and bushes. Stop whoever is coming… or die.”
Around him shuffled twelve Urgals with short swords and round iron shields painted with black symbols.
They resembled men with bowed legs and thick, brutish arms made for crushing. A pair of twisted horns
grew above their small ears. The monsters hurried into the brush, grunting as they hid. Soon the rustling
quieted and the forest was silent again.
The Shade peered around a thick tree and looked up the trail. It was too dark for any human to see, but
for him the faint moonlight was like sunshine streaming between the trees; every detail was clear and
sharp to his searching gaze. He remained unnaturally quiet, a long pale sword in his hand. A wire-thin
scratch curved down the blade. The weapon was thin enough to slip between a pair of ribs, yet stout
enough to hack through the hardest armor.
The Urgals could not see as well as the Shade; they groped like blind beggars, fumbling with their
weapons. An owl screeched, cutting through the silence. No one relaxed until the bird flew past. Then the
monsters shivered in the cold night; one snapped a twig with his heavy boot. The Shade hissed in anger,
and the Urgals shrank back, motionless. He suppressed his distaste—they smelled like fetid meat—and
turned away. They were tools, nothing more.
The Shade forced back his impatience as the minutes became hours. The scent must have wafted far
ahead of its owners. He did not let the Urgals get up or warm themselves. He denied himself those
luxuries, too, and stayed behind the tree, watching the trail. Another gust of wind rushed through the
forest. The smell was stronger this time. Excited, he lifted a thin lip in a snarl.
“Get ready,” he whispered, his whole body vibrating. The tip of his sword moved in small circles. It had
taken many plots and much pain to bring himself to this moment. It would not do to lose control now.
Eyes brightened under the Urgals’ thick brows, and the creatures gripped their weapons tighter. Ahead
of them, the Shade heard a clink as something hard struck a loose stone. Faint smudges emerged from
the darkness and advanced down the trail.
Three white horses with riders cantered toward the ambush, their heads held high and proud, their coats
rippling in the moonlight like liquid silver.
On the first horse was an elf with pointed ears and elegantly slanted eyebrows. His build was slim but
strong, like a rapier. A powerful bow was slung on his back. A sword pressed against his side opposite a
quiver of arrows fletched with swan feathers.
The last rider had the same fair face and angled features as the other. He carried a long spear in his right
hand and a white dagger at his belt. A helm of extraordinary craftsmanship, wrought with amber and
gold, rested on his head.
Between these two rode a raven-haired elven lady, who surveyed her surroundings with poise. Framed
by long black locks, her deep eyes shone with a driving force. Her clothes were unadorned, yet her
beauty was undiminished. At her side was a sword, and on her back a long bow with a quiver. She
carried in her lap a pouch that she frequently looked at, as if to reassure herself that it was still there.
One of the elves spoke quietly, but the Shade could not hear what was said. The lady answered with
obvious authority, and her guards switched places. The one wearing the helm took the lead, shifting his

Page 7

spear to a readier grip. They passed the Shade’s hiding place and the first few Urgals without suspicion.
The Shade was already savoring his victory when the wind changed direction and swept toward the
elves, heavy with the Urgals’ stench. The horses snorted with alarm and tossed their heads. The riders
stiffened, eyes flashing from side to side, then wheeled their mounts around and galloped away.
The lady’s horse surged forward, leaving her guards far behind. Forsaking their hiding, the Urgals stood
and released a stream of black arrows. The Shade jumped out from behind the tree, raised his right hand,
and shouted, “Garjzla!”
A red bolt flashed from his palm toward the elven lady, illuminating the trees with a bloody light. It struck
her steed, and the horse toppled with a high-pitched squeal, plowing into the ground chest-first. She leapt
off the animal with inhuman speed, landed lightly, then glanced back for her guards.
The Urgals’ deadly arrows quickly brought down the two elves. They fell from the noble horses, blood
pooling in the dirt. As the Urgals rushed to the slain elves, the Shade screamed, “After her! She is the one
I want!” The monsters grunted and rushed down the trail.
A cry tore from the elf’s lips as she saw her dead companions. She took a step toward them, then
cursed her enemies and bounded into the forest.
While the Urgals crashed through the trees, the Shade climbed a piece of granite that jutted above them.
From his perch he could see all of the surrounding forest. He raised his hand and uttered, “Böetq istalri!”
and a quarter-mile section of the forest exploded into flames. Grimly he burned one section after another
until there was a ring of fire, a half-league across, around the ambush site. The flames looked like a
molten crown resting on the forest. Satisfied, he watched the ring carefully, in case it should falter.
The band of fire thickened, contracting the area the Urgals had to search. Suddenly, the Shade heard
shouts and a coarse scream. Through the trees he saw three of his charges fall in a pile, mortally
wounded. He caught a glimpse of the elf running from the remaining Urgals.
She fled toward the craggy piece of granite at a tremendous speed. The Shade examined the ground
twenty feet below, then jumped and landed nimbly in front of her. She skidded around and sped back to
the trail. Black Urgal blood dripped from her sword, staining the pouch in her hand.
The horned monsters came out of the forest and hemmed her in, blocking the only escape routes. Her
head whipped around as she tried to find a way out. Seeing none, she drew herself up with regal disdain.
The Shade approached her with a raised hand, allowing himself to enjoy her helplessness.
“Get her.”
As the Urgals surged forward, the elf pulled open the pouch, reached into it, and then let it drop to the
ground. In her hands was a large sapphire stone that reflected the angry light of the fires. She raised it
over her head, lips forming frantic words. Desperate, the Shade barked, “Garjzla!”
A ball of red flame sprang from his hand and flew toward the elf, fast as an arrow. But he was too late.
A flash of emerald light briefly illuminated the forest, and the stone vanished. Then the red fire smote her
and she collapsed.
The Shade howled in rage and stalked forward, flinging his sword at a tree. It passed halfway through
the trunk, where it stuck, quivering. He shot nine bolts of energy from his palm—which killed the Urgals

instantly—then ripped his sword free and strode to the elf.
Prophecies of revenge, spoken in a wretched language only he knew, rolled from his tongue. He
clenched his thin hands and glared at the sky. The cold stars stared back, unwinking, otherworldly
watchers. Disgust curled his lip before he turned back to the unconscious elf.
Her beauty, which would have entranced any mortal man, held no charm for him. He confirmed that the
stone was gone, then retrieved his horse from its hiding place among the trees. After tying the elf onto the
saddle, he mounted the charger and made his way out of the woods.
He quenched the fires in his path but left the rest to burn.
DISCOVERY
Eragon knelt in a bed of trampled reed grass and scanned the tracks with a practiced eye. The prints
told him that the deer had been in the meadow only a half-hour before. Soon they would bed down. His
target, a small doe with a pronounced limp in her left forefoot, was still with the herd. He was amazed she
had made it so far without a wolf or bear catching her.
The sky was clear and dark, and a slight breeze stirred the air. A silvery cloud drifted over the mountains
that surrounded him, its edges glowing with ruddy light cast from the harvest moon cradled between two
peaks. Streams flowed down the mountains from stolid glaciers and glistening snowpacks. A brooding
mist crept along the valley’s floor, almost thick enough to obscure his feet.
Eragon was fifteen, less than a year from manhood. Dark eyebrows rested above his intense brown
eyes. His clothes were worn from work. A hunting knife with a bone handle was sheathed at his belt, and
a buckskin tube protected his yew bow from the mist. He carried a wood-frame pack.
The deer had led him deep into the Spine, a range of untamed mountains that extended up and down the
land of Alagaësia. Strange tales and men often came from those mountains, usually boding ill. Despite
that, Eragon did not fear the Spine—he was the only hunter near Carvahall who dared track game deep
into its craggy recesses.
It was the third night of the hunt, and his food was half gone. If he did not fell the doe, he would be
forced to return home empty-handed. His family needed the meat for the rapidly approaching winter and
could not afford to buy it in Carvahall.
Eragon stood with quiet assurance in the dusky moonlight, then strode into the forest toward a glen
where he was sure the deer would rest. The trees blocked the sky from view and cast feathery shadows
on the ground. He looked at the tracks only occasionally; he knew the way.
At the glen, he strung his bow with a sure touch, then drew three arrows and nocked one, holding the
others in his left hand. The moonlight revealed twenty or so motionless lumps where the deer lay in the
grass. The doe he wanted was at the edge of the herd, her left foreleg stretched out awkwardly.
Eragon slowly crept closer, keeping the bow ready. All his work of the past three days had led to this
moment. He took a last steadying breath and—an explosion shattered the night.
The herd bolted. Eragon lunged forward, racing through the grass as a fiery wind surged past his cheek.
He slid to a stop and loosed an arrow at the bounding doe. It missed by a finger’s breadth and hissed
into darkness. He cursed and spun around, instinctively nocking another arrow.

Page 9

Behind him, where the deer had been, smoldered a large circle of grass and trees. Many of the pines
stood bare of their needles. The grass outside the charring was flattened. A wisp of smoke curled in the
air, carrying a burnt smell. In the center of the blast radius lay a polished blue stone. Mist snaked across
the scorched area and swirled insubstantial tendrils over the stone.
Eragon watched for danger for several long minutes, but the only thing that moved was the mist.
Cautiously, he released the tension from his bow and moved forward. Moonlight cast him in pale shadow
as he stopped before the stone. He nudged it with an arrow, then jumped back. Nothing happened, so
he warily picked it up.
Nature had never polished a stone as smooth as this one. Its flawless surface was dark blue, except for
thin veins of white that spiderwebbed across it. The stone was cool and frictionless under his fingers, like
hardened silk. Oval and about a foot long, it weighed several pounds, though it felt lighter than it should
have.
Eragon found the stone both beautiful and frightening.Where did it come from? Does it have a purpose?
Then a more disturbing thought came to him:Was it sent here by accident, or am I meant to have it? If he
had learned anything from the old stories, it was to treat magic, and those who used it, with great caution.
But what should I do with the stone?It would be tiresome to carry, and there was a chance it was
dangerous. It might be better to leave it behind. A flicker of indecision ran through him, and he almost
dropped it, but something stayed his hand.At the very least, it might pay for some food, he decided with
a shrug, tucking the stone into his pack.
The glen was too exposed to make a safe camp, so he slipped back into the forest and spread his
bedroll beneath the upturned roots of a fallen tree. After a cold dinner of bread and cheese, he wrapped
himself in blankets and fell asleep, pondering what had occurred.
PALANCARVALLEY
The sun rose the next morning with a glorious conflagration of pink and yellow. The air was fresh, sweet,
and very cold. Ice edged the streams, and small pools were completely frozen over. After a breakfast of
porridge, Eragon returned to the glen and examined the charred area. The morning light revealed no new
details, so he started for home.
The rough game trail was faintly worn and, in places, nonexistent. Because it had been forged by
animals, it often backtracked and took long detours. Yet for all its flaws, it was still the fastest way out of
the mountains.
The Spine was one of the only places that King Galbatorix could not call his own. Stories were still told
about how half his army disappeared after marching into its ancient forest. A cloud of misfortune and bad
luck seemed to hang over it. Though the trees grew tall and the sky shone brightly, few people could stay
in the Spine for long without suffering an accident. Eragon was one of those few—not through any
particular gift, it seemed to him, but because of persistent vigilance and sharp reflexes. He had hiked in
the mountains for years, yet he was still wary of them. Every time he thought they had surrendered their
secrets, something happened to upset his understanding of them—like the stone’s appearance.
He kept up a brisk pace, and the leagues steadily disappeared. In late evening he arrived at the edge of
a precipitous ravine. The Anora River rushed by far below, heading to Palancar Valley. Gorged with
hundreds of tiny streams, the river was a brute force, battling against the rocks and boulders that barred

Page 10

its way. A low rumble filled the air.
He camped in a thicket near the ravine and watched the moonrise before going to bed.
It grew colder over the next day and a half. Eragon traveled quickly and saw little of the wary wildlife. A
bit past noon, he heard the Igualda Falls blanketing everything with the dull sound of a thousand splashes.
The trail led him onto a moist slate outcropping, which the river sped past, flinging itself into empty air and
down mossy cliffs.
Before him lay Palancar Valley, exposed like an unrolled map. The base of the Igualda Falls, more than
a half-mile below, was the northernmost point of the valley. A little ways from the falls was Carvahall, a
cluster of brown buildings. White smoke rose from the chimneys, defiant of the wilderness around it. At
this height, farms were small square patches no bigger than the end of his finger. The land around them
was tan or sandy, where dead grass swayed in the wind. The Anora River wound from the falls toward
Palancar’s southern end, reflecting great strips of sunlight. Far in the distance it flowed past the village
Therinsford and the lonely mountain Utgard. Beyond that, he knew only that it turned north and ran to the
sea.
After a pause, Eragon left the outcropping and started down the trail, grimacing at the descent. When he
arrived at the bottom, soft dusk was creeping over everything, blurring colors and shapes into gray
masses. Carvahall’s lights shimmered nearby in the twilight; the houses cast long shadows. Aside from
Therinsford, Carvahall was the only village in Palancar Valley. The settlement was secluded and
surrounded by harsh, beautiful land. Few traveled here except merchants and trappers.
The village was composed of stout log buildings with low roofs—some thatched, others shingled. Smoke
billowed from the chimneys, giving the air a woody smell. The buildings had wide porches where people
gathered to talk and conduct business. Occasionally a window brightened as a candle or lamp was lit.
Eragon heard men talking loudly in the evening air while wives scurried to fetch their husbands, scolding
them for being late.
Eragon wove his way between the houses to the butcher’s shop, a broad, thick-beamed building.
Overhead, the chimney belched black smoke.
He pushed the door open. The spacious room was warm and well lit by a fire snapping in a stone
fireplace. A bare counter stretched across the far side of the room. The floor was strewn with loose
straw. Everything was scrupulously clean, as if the owner spent his leisure time digging in obscure
crannies for minuscule pieces of filth. Behind the counter stood the butcher Sloan. A small man, he wore
a cotton shirt and a long, bloodstained smock. An impressive array of knives swung from his belt. He had
a sallow, pockmarked face, and his black eyes were suspicious. He polished the counter with a ragged
cloth.
Sloan’s mouth twisted as Eragon entered. “Well, the mighty hunter joins the rest of us mortals. How
many did you bag this time?”
“None,” was Eragon’s curt reply. He had never liked Sloan. The butcher always treated him with
disdain, as if he were something unclean. A widower, Sloan seemed to care for only one person—his
daughter, Katrina, on whom he doted.
“I’m amazed,” said Sloan with affected astonishment. He turned his back on Eragon to scrape something
off the wall. “And that’s your reason for coming here?”

Page 11

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“Yes,” admitted Eragon uncomfortably.
“If that’s the case, let’s see your money.” Sloan tapped his fingers when Eragon shifted his feet and
remained silent. “Come on—either you have it or you don’t. Which is it?”
“I don’t really have any money, but I do—”
“What, no money?” the butcher cut him off sharply. “And you expect to buy meat! Are the other
merchants giving away their wares? Should I just hand you the goods without charge? Besides,” he said
abruptly, “it’s late. Come back tomorrow with money. I’m closed for the day.”
Eragon glared at him. “I can’t wait until tomorrow, Sloan. It’ll be worth your while, though; I found
something to pay you with.” He pulled out the stone with a flourish and set it gently on the scarred
counter, where it gleamed with light from the dancing flames.
“Stole it is more likely,” muttered Sloan, leaning forward with an interested expression.
Ignoring the comment, Eragon asked, “Will this be enough?”
Sloan picked up the stone and gauged its weight speculatively. He ran his hands over its smoothness and
inspected the white veins. With a calculating look, he set it down. “It’s pretty, but how much is it worth?”
“I don’t know,” admitted Eragon, “but no one would have gone to the trouble of shaping it unless it had
some value.”
“Obviously,” said Sloan with exaggerated patience. “But how much value? Since you don’t know, I
suggest that you find a trader who does, or take my offer of three crowns.”
“That’s a miser’s bargain! It must be worth at least ten times that,” protested Eragon. Three crowns
would not even buy enough meat to last a week.
Sloan shrugged. “If you don’t like my offer, wait until the traders arrive. Either way, I’m tired of this
conversation.”
The traders were a nomadic group of merchants and entertainers who visited Carvahall every spring and
winter. They bought whatever excess the villagers and local farmers had managed to grow or make, and
sold what they needed to live through another year: seeds, animals, fabric, and supplies like salt and
sugar.
But Eragon did not want to wait until they arrived; it could be a while, and his family needed the meat
now. “Fine, I accept,” he snapped.
“Good, I’ll get you the meat. Not that it matters, but where did you find this?”
“Two nights ago in the Spine—”
“Get out!” demanded Sloan, pushing the stone away. He stomped furiously to the end of the counter and
started scrubbing old bloodstains off a knife.
“Why?” asked Eragon. He drew the stone closer, as if to protect it from Sloan’s wrath.

Page 12

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“I won’t deal with anything you bring back from those damned mountains! Take your sorcerer’s stone
elsewhere.” Sloan’s hand suddenly slipped and he cut a finger on the knife, but he seemed not to notice.
He continued to scrub, staining the blade with fresh blood.
“You refuse to sell to me!”
“Yes! Unless you pay with coins,” Sloan growled, and hefted the knife, sidling away. “Go, before I
make you!”
The door behind them slammed open. Eragon whirled around, ready for more trouble. In stomped
Horst, a hulking man. Sloan’s daughter, Katrina—a tall girl of sixteen—trailed behind him with a
determined expression. Eragon was surprised to see her; she usually absented herself from any arguments
involving her father. Sloan glanced at them warily, then started to accuse Eragon. “He won’t—”
“Quiet,” announced Horst in a rumbling voice, cracking his knuckles at the same time. He was
Carvahall’s smith, as his thick neck and scarred leather apron attested. His powerful arms were bare to
the elbow; a great expanse of hairy muscular chest was visible through the top of his shirt. A black beard,
carelessly trimmed, roiled and knotted like his jaw muscles. “Sloan, what have you done now?”
“Nothing.” He gave Eragon a murderous gaze, then spat, “This…boy came in here and started
badgering me. I asked him to leave, but he won’t budge. I even threatened him and he still ignored me!”
Sloan seemed to shrink as he looked at Horst.
“Is this true?” demanded the smith.
“No!” replied Eragon. “I offered this stone as payment for some meat, and he accepted it. When I told
him that I’d found it in the Spine, he refused to even touch it. What difference does it make where it came
from?”
Horst looked at the stone curiously, then returned his attention to the butcher. “Why won’t you trade
with him, Sloan? I’ve no love for the Spine myself, but if it’s a question of the stone’s worth, I’ll back it
with my own money.”
The question hung in the air for a moment. Then Sloan licked his lips and said, “This is my own store. I
can do whatever I want.”
Katrina stepped out from behind Horst and tossed back her auburn hair like a spray of molten copper.
“Father, Eragonis willing to pay. Give him the meat, and then we can have supper.”
Sloan’s eyes narrowed dangerously. “Go back to the house; this is none of your business… I saidgo !”
Katrina’s face hardened, then she marched out of the room with a stiff back.
Eragon watched with disapproval but dared not interfere. Horst tugged at his beard before saying
reproachfully, “Fine, you can deal with me. What were you going to get, Eragon?” His voice
reverberated through the room.
“As much as I could.”
Horst pulled out a purse and counted out a pile of coins. “Give me your best roasts and steaks. Make
sure that it’s enough to fill Eragon’s pack.” The butcher hesitated, his gaze darting between Horst and

Page 13

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Eragon. “Not selling to me would be a very bad idea,” stated Horst.
Glowering venomously, Sloan slipped into the back room. A frenzy of chopping, wrapping, and low
cursing reached them. After several uncomfortable minutes, he returned with an armful of wrapped meat.
His face was expressionless as he accepted Horst’s money, then proceeded to clean his knife, pretending
that they were not there.
Horst scooped up the meat and walked outside. Eragon hurried behind him, carrying his pack and the
stone. The crisp night air rolled over their faces, refreshing after the stuffy shop.
“Thank you, Horst. Uncle Garrow will be pleased.”
Horst laughed quietly. “Don’t thank me. I’ve wanted to do that for a long time. Sloan’s a vicious
troublemaker; it does him good to be humbled. Katrina heard what was happening and ran to fetch me.
Good thing I came—the two of you were almost at blows. Unfortunately, I doubt he’ll serve you or any
of your family the next time you go in there, even if you do have coins.”
“Why did he explode like that? We’ve never been friendly, but he’s always taken our money. And I’ve
never seen him treat Katrina that way,” said Eragon, opening the top of the pack.
Horst shrugged. “Ask your uncle. He knows more about it than I do.”
Eragon stuffed the meat into his pack. “Well, now I have one more reason to hurry home… to solve this
mystery. Here, this is rightfully yours.” He proffered the stone.
Horst chuckled. “No, you keep your strange rock. As for payment, Albriech plans to leave for Feinster
next spring. He wants to become a master smith, and I’m going to need an assistant. You can come and
work off the debt on your spare days.”
Eragon bowed slightly, delighted. Horst had two sons, Albriech and Baldor, both of whom worked in
his forge. Taking one’s place was a generous offer. “Again, thank you! I look forward to working with
you.” He was glad that there was a way for him to pay Horst. His uncle would never accept charity.
Then Eragon remembered what his cousin had told him before he had left on the hunt. “Roran wanted me
to give Katrina a message, but since I can’t, can you get it to her?”
“Of course.”
“He wants her to know that he’ll come into town as soon as the merchants arrive and that he will see her
then.”
“That all?”
Eragon was slightly embarrassed. “No, he also wants her to know that she is the most beautiful girl he
has ever seen and that he thinks of nothing else.”
Horst’s face broke into a broad grin, and he winked at Eragon. “Getting serious, isn’t he?”
“Yes, sir,” Eragon answered with a quick smile. “Could you also give her my thanks? It was nice of her
to stand up to her father for me. I hope that she isn’t punished because of it. Roran would be furious if I
got her into trouble.”

“I wouldn’t worry about it. Sloan doesn’t know that she called me, so I doubt he’ll be too hard on her.
Before you go, will you sup with us?”
“I’m sorry, but I can’t. Garrow is expecting me,” said Eragon, tying off the top of the pack. He hoisted it
onto his back and started down the road, raising his hand in farewell.
The meat slowed him down, but he was eager to be home, and renewed vigor filled his steps. The village
ended abruptly, and he left its warm lights behind. The pearlescent moon peeked over the mountains,
bathing the land in a ghostly reflection of daylight. Everything looked bleached and flat.
Near the end of his journey, he turned off the road, which continued south. A simple path led straight
through waist-high grass and up a knoll, almost hidden by the shadows of protective elm trees. He
crested the hill and saw a gentle light shining from his home.
The house had a shingled roof and a brick chimney. Eaves hung over the whitewashed walls, shadowing
the ground below. One side of the enclosed porch was filled with split wood, ready for the fire. A jumble
of farm tools cluttered the other side.
The house had been abandoned for half a century when they moved in after Garrow’s wife, Marian,
died. It was ten miles from Carvahall, farther than anyone else’s. People considered the distance
dangerous because the family could not rely on help from the village in times of trouble, but Eragon’s
uncle would not listen.
A hundred feet from the house, in a dull-colored barn, lived two horses—Birka and Brugh—with
chickens and a cow. Sometimes there was also a pig, but they had been unable to afford one this year. A
wagon sat wedged between the stalls. On the edge of their fields, a thick line of trees traced along the
Anora River.
He saw a light move behind a window as he wearily reached the porch. “Uncle, it’s Eragon. Let me in.”
A small shutter slid back for a second, then the door swung inward.
Garrow stood with his hand on the door. His worn clothes hung on him like rags on a stick frame. A
lean, hungry face with intense eyes gazed out from under graying hair. He looked like a man who had
been partly mummified before it was discovered that he was still alive. “Roran’s sleeping,” was his
answer to Eragon’s inquiring glance.
A lantern flickered on a wood table so old that the grain stood up in tiny ridges like a giant fingerprint.
Near a woodstove were rows of cooking utensils tacked onto the wall with homemade nails. A second
door opened to the rest of the house. The floor was made of boards polished smooth by years of
tramping feet.
Eragon pulled off his pack and took out the meat. “What’s this? Did you buy meat? Where did you get
the money?” asked his uncle harshly as he saw the wrapped packages.
Eragon took a breath before answering. “No, Horst bought it for us.”
“You let him pay for it? I told you before, I won’t beg for our food. If we can’t feed ourselves, we might
as well move into town. Before you can turn around twice, they’ll be sending us used clothes and asking
if we’ll be able to get through the winter.” Garrow’s face paled with anger.
“I didn’t accept charity,” snapped Eragon. “Horst agreed to let me work off the debt this spring. He

needs someone to help him because Albriech is going away.”
“And where will you get the time to work for him? Are you going to ignore all the things that need to be
done here?” asked Garrow, forcing his voice down.
Eragon hung his bow and quiver on hooks beside the front door. “I don’t know how I’ll do it,” he said
irritably. “Besides, I found something that could be worth some money.” He set the stone on the table.
Garrow bowed over it: the hungry look on his face became ravenous, and his fingers moved with a
strange twitch. “You found this in the Spine?”
“Yes,” said Eragon. He explained what had happened. “And to make matters worse, I lost my best
arrow. I’ll have to make more before long.” They stared at the stone in the near darkness.
“How was the weather?” asked his uncle, lifting the stone. His hands tightened around it like he was
afraid it would suddenly disappear.
“Cold,” was Eragon’s reply. “It didn’t snow, but it froze each night.”
Garrow looked worried by the news. “Tomorrow you’ll have to help Roran finish harvesting the barley.
If we can get the squash picked, too, the frost won’t bother us.” He passed the stone to Eragon. “Here,
keep it. When the traders come, we’ll find out what it’s worth. Selling it is probably the best thing to do.
The less we’re involved with magic, the better… Why did Horst pay for the meat?”
It took only a moment for Eragon to explain his argument with Sloan. “I just don’t understand what
angered him so.”
Garrow shrugged. “Sloan’s wife, Ismira, went over the Igualda Falls a year before you were brought
here. He hasn’t been near the Spine since, nor had anything to do with it. But that’s no reason to refuse
payment. I think he wanted to give you trouble.”
Eragon swayed blearily and said, “It’s good to be back.” Garrow’s eyes softened, and he nodded.
Eragon stumbled to his room, pushed the stone under his bed, then fell onto the mattress.Home . For the
first time since before the hunt, he relaxed completely as sleep overtook him.
DRAGONTALES
At dawn the sun’s rays streamed through the window, warming Eragon’s face. Rubbing his eyes, he sat
up on the edge of the bed. The pine floor was cold under his feet. He stretched his sore legs and rubbed
his back, yawning.
Beside the bed was a row of shelves covered with objects he had collected. There were twisted pieces
of wood, odd bits of shells, rocks that had broken to reveal shiny interiors, and strips of dry grass tied
into knots. His favorite item was a root so convoluted he never tired of looking at it. The rest of the room
was bare, except for a small dresser and nightstand.
He pulled on his boots and stared at the floor, thinking. This was a special day. It was near this very
hour, sixteen years ago, that his mother, Selena, had come home to Carvahall alone and pregnant. She
had been gone for six years, living in the cities. When she returned, she wore expensive clothes, and her
hair was bound by a net of pearls. She had sought out her brother, Garrow, and asked to stay with him
until the baby arrived. Within five months her son was born. Everyone was shocked when Selena

Page 16

tearfully begged Garrow and Marian to raise him. When they asked why, she only wept and said, “I
must.” Her pleas had grown increasingly desperate until they finally agreed. She named him Eragon, then
departed early the next morning and never returned.
Eragon still remembered how he had felt when Marian told him the story before she died. The realization
that Garrow and Marian were not his real parents had disturbed him greatly. Things that had been
permanent and unquestionable were suddenly thrown into doubt. Eventually he had learned to live with it,
but he always had a nagging suspicion that he had not been good enough for his mother.I’m sure there
was a good reason for what she did; I only wish I knew what it was.
One other thing bothered him: Who was his father? Selena had told no one, and whoever it might be had
never come looking for Eragon. He wished that he knew who it was, if only to have a name. It would be
nice to know his heritage.
He sighed and went to the nightstand, where he splashed his face, shivering as the water ran down his
neck. Refreshed, he retrieved the stone from under the bed and set it on a shelf. The morning light
caressed it, throwing a warm shadow on the wall. He touched it one more time, then hurried to the
kitchen, eager to see his family. Garrow and Roran were already there, eating chicken. As Eragon
greeted them, Roran stood with a grin.
Roran was two years older than Eragon, muscular, sturdy, and careful with his movements. They could
not have been closer even if they had been real brothers.
Roran smiled. “I’m glad you’re back. How was the trip?”
“Hard,” replied Eragon. “Did Uncle tell you what happened?” He helped himself to a piece of chicken,
which he devoured hungrily.
“No,” said Roran, and the story was quickly told. At Roran’s insistence, Eragon left his food to show
him the stone. This elicited a satisfactory amount of awe, but Roran soon asked nervously, “Were you
able to talk with Katrina?”
“No, there wasn’t an opportunity after the argument with Sloan. But she’ll expect you when the traders
come. I gave the message to Horst; he will get it to her.”
“You told Horst?” said Roran incredulously. “That was private. If I wanted everyone to know about it, I
could have built a bonfire and used smoke signals to communicate. If Sloan finds out, he won’t let me see
her again.”
“Horst will be discreet,” assured Eragon. “He won’t let anyone fall prey to Sloan, least of all you.”
Roran seemed unconvinced, but argued no more. They returned to their meals in the taciturn presence of
Garrow. When the last bites were finished, all three went to work in the fields.
The sun was cold and pale, providing little comfort. Under its watchful eye, the last of the barley was
stored in the barn. Next, they gathered prickly vined squash, then the rutabagas, beets, peas, turnips, and
beans, which they packed into the root cellar. After hours of labor, they stretched their cramped muscles,
pleased that the harvest was finished.
The following days were spent pickling, salting, shelling, and preparing the food for winter.
Nine days after Eragon’s return, a vicious blizzard blew out of the mountains and settled over the valley.

The snow came down in great sheets, blanketing the countryside in white. They only dared leave the
house for firewood and to feed the animals, for they feared getting lost in the howling wind and
featureless landscape. They spent their time huddled over the stove as gusts rattled the heavy window
shutters. Days later the storm finally passed, revealing an alien world of soft white drifts.
“I’m afraid the traders may not come this year, with conditions this bad,” said Garrow. “They’re late as
it is. We’ll give them a chance and wait before going to Carvahall. But if they don’t show soon, we’ll
have to buy any spare supplies from the townspeople.” His countenance was resigned.
They grew anxious as the days crept by without sign of the traders. Talk was sparse, and depression
hung over the house.
On the eighth morning, Roran walked to the road and confirmed that the traders had not yet passed. The
day was spent readying for the trip into Carvahall, scrounging with grim expressions for saleable items.
That evening, out of desperation, Eragon checked the road again. He found deep ruts cut into the snow,
with numerous hoofprints between them. Elated, he ran back to the house whooping, bringing new life to
their preparations.

They packed their surplus produce into the wagon before sunrise. Garrow put the year’s money in a
leather pouch that he carefully fastened to his belt. Eragon set the wrapped stone between bags of grain
so it would not roll when the wagon hit bumps.
After a hasty breakfast, they harnessed the horses and cleared a path to the road. The traders’ wagons
had already broken the drifts, which sped their progress. By noon they could see Carvahall.
In daylight, it was a small earthy village filled with shouts and laughter. The traders had made camp in an
empty field on the outskirts of town. Groups of wagons, tents, and fires were randomly spread across it,
spots of color against the snow. The troubadours’ four tents were garishly decorated. A steady stream of
people linked the camp to the village.
Crowds churned around a line of bright tents and booths clogging the main street. Horses whinnied at
the noise. The snow had been pounded flat, giving it a glassy surface; elsewhere, bonfires had melted it.
Roasted hazelnuts added a rich aroma to the smells wafting around them.
Garrow parked the wagon and picketed the horses, then drew coins from his pouch. “Get yourselves
some treats. Roran, do what you want, only be at Horst’s in time for supper. Eragon, bring that stone
and come with me.” Eragon grinned at Roran and pocketed the money, already planning how to spend it.
Roran departed immediately with a determined expression on his face. Garrow led Eragon into the
throng, shouldering his way through the bustle. Women were buying cloth, while nearby their husbands
examined a new latch, hook, or tool. Children ran up and down the road, shrieking with excitement.
Knives were displayed here, spices there, and pots were laid out in shiny rows next to leather harnesses.
Eragon stared at the traders curiously. They seemed less prosperous than last year. Their children had a
frightened, wary look, and their clothes were patched. The gaunt men carried swords and daggers with a
new familiarity, and even the women had poniards belted at their waists.
What could have happened to make them like this? And why are they so late?wondered Eragon. He
remembered the traders as being full of good cheer, but there was none of that now. Garrow pushed

Page 18

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

down the street, searching for Merlock, a trader who specialized in odd trinkets and pieces of jewelry.
They found him behind a booth, displaying brooches to a group of women. As each new piece was
revealed, exclamations of admiration followed. Eragon guessed that more than a few purses would soon
be depleted. Merlock seemed to flourish and grow every time his wares were complimented. He wore a
goatee, held himself with ease, and seemed to regard the rest of the world with slight contempt.
The excited group prevented Garrow and Eragon from getting near the trader, so they settled on a step
and waited. As soon as Merlock was unoccupied, they hurried over.
“And what might you sirs want to look at?” asked Merlock. “An amulet or trinket for a lady?” With a
twirl he pulled out a delicately carved silver rose of excellent workmanship. The polished metal caught
Eragon’s attention, and he eyed it appreciatively. The trader continued, “Not even three crowns, though
it has come all the way from the famed craftsmen of Belatona.”
Garrow spoke in a quiet voice. “We aren’t looking to buy, but to sell.” Merlock immediately covered
the rose and looked at them with new interest.
“I see. Maybe, if this item is of any value, you would like to trade it for one or two of these exquisite
pieces.” He paused for a moment while Eragon and his uncle stood uncomfortably, then continued, “You
didbring the object of consideration?”
“We have it, but we would rather show it to you elsewhere,” said Garrow in a firm voice.
Merlock raised an eyebrow, but spoke smoothly. “In that case, let me invite you to my tent.” He
gathered up his wares and gently laid them in an iron-bound chest, which he locked. Then he ushered
them up the street and into the temporary camp. They wound between the wagons to a tent removed
from the rest of the traders’. It was crimson at the top and sable at the bottom, with thin triangles of
colors stabbing into each other. Merlock untied the opening and swung the flap to one side.
Small trinkets and strange pieces of furniture, such as a round bed and three seats carved from tree
stumps, filled the tent. A gnarled dagger with a ruby in the pommel rested on a white cushion.
Merlock closed the flap and turned to them. “Please, seat yourselves.” When they had, he said, “Now
show me why we are meeting in private.” Eragon unwrapped the stone and set it between the two men.
Merlock reached for it with a gleam in his eye, then stopped and asked, “May I?” When Garrow
indicated his approval, Merlock picked it up.
He put the stone in his lap and reached to one side for a thin box. Opened, it revealed a large set of
copper scales, which he set on the ground. After weighing the stone, he scrutinized its surface under a
jeweler’s glass, tapped it gently with a wooden mallet, and drew the point of a tiny clear stone over it. He
measured its length and diameter, then recorded the figures on a slate. He considered the results for a
while. “Do you know what this is worth?”
“No,” admitted Garrow. His cheek twitched, and he shifted uncomfortably on the seat.
Merlock grimaced. “Unfortunately, neither do I. But I can tell you this much: the white veins are the
same material as the blue that surrounds them, only a different color. What that material might be, though,
I haven’t a clue. It’s harder than any rock I have seen, harder even than diamond. Whoever shaped it
used tools I have never seen—or magic. Also, it’s hollow.”

Page 19

“What?” exclaimed Garrow.
An irritated edge crept into Merlock’s voice. “Did you ever hear a rock sound like this?” He grabbed
the dagger from the cushion and slapped the stone with the flat of the blade. A pure note filled the air,
then faded away smoothly. Eragon was alarmed, afraid that the stone had been damaged. Merlock tilted
the stone toward them. “You will find no scratches or blemishes where the dagger struck. I doubt I could
do anything to harm this stone, even if I took a hammer to it.”
Garrow crossed his arms with a reserved expression. A wall of silence surrounded him. Eragon was
puzzled.I knew that the stone appeared in the Spine through magic, but made by magic? What for and
why? He blurted, “But what is it worth?”
“I can’t tell you that,” said Merlock in a pained voice. “I am sure there are people who would pay dearly
to have it, but none of them are in Carvahall. You would have to go to the southern cities to find a buyer.
This is a curiosity for most people—not an item to spend money on when practical things are needed.”
Garrow stared at the tent ceiling like a gambler calculating the odds. “Will you buy it?”
The trader answered instantly, “It’s not worth the risk. I might be able to find a wealthy buyer during my
spring travels, but I can’t be certain. Even if I did, you wouldn’t be paid until I returned next year. No,
you will have to find someone else to trade with. I am curious, however… Why did you insist on talking
to me in private?”
Eragon put the stone away before answering. “Because,” he glanced at the man, wondering if he would
explode like Sloan, “I found this in the Spine, and folks around here don’t like that.”
Merlock gave him a startled look. “Do you know why my fellow merchants and I were late this year?”
Eragon shook his head.
“Our wanderings have been dogged with misfortune. Chaos seems to rule Alagaësia. We could not
avoid illness, attacks, and the most cursed black luck. Because the Varden’s attacks have increased,
Galbatorix has forced cities to send more soldiers to the borders, men who are needed to combat the
Urgals. The brutes have been migrating southeast, toward the Hadarac Desert. No one knows why and it
wouldn’t concern us, except that they’re passing through populated areas. They’ve been spotted on
roads and near cities. Worst of all are reports of a Shade, though the stories are unconfirmed. Not many
people survive such an encounter.”
“Why haven’t we heard of this?” cried Eragon.
“Because,” said Merlock grimly, “it only began a few months ago. Whole villages have been forced to
move because Urgals destroyed their fields and starvation threatens.”
“Nonsense,” growled Garrow. “We haven’t seen any Urgals; the only one around here has his horns
mounted in Morn’s tavern.”
Merlock arched an eyebrow. “Maybe so, but this is a small village hidden by mountains. It’s not
surprising that you’ve escaped notice. However, I wouldn’t expect that to last. I only mentioned this
because strange things are happening here as well if you found such a stone in the Spine.” With that
sobering statement, he bid them farewell with a bow and slight smile.

Garrow headed back to Carvahall with Eragon trailing behind. “What do you think?” asked Eragon.
“I’m going to get more information before I make up my mind. Take the stone back to the wagon, then
do what you want. I’ll meet you for dinner at Horst’s.”
Eragon dodged through the crowd and happily dashed back to the wagon. Trading would take his uncle
hours, time that he planned to enjoy fully. He hid the stone under the bags, then set out into town with a
cocky stride.
He walked from one booth to another, evaluating the goods with a buyer’s eye, despite his meager
supply of coins. When he talked with the merchants, they confirmed what Merlock had said about the
instability in Alagaësia. Over and over the message was repeated: last year’s security has deserted us;
new dangers have appeared, and nothing is safe.
Later in the day he bought three sticks of malt candy and a small piping-hot cherry pie. The hot food felt
good after hours of standing in the snow. He licked the sticky syrup from his fingers regretfully, wishing
for more, then sat on the edge of a porch and nibbled a piece of candy. Two boys from Carvahall
wrestled nearby, but he felt no inclination to join them.
As the day descended into late afternoon, the traders took their business into people’s homes. Eragon
was impatient for evening, when the troubadours would come out to tell stories and perform tricks. He
loved hearing about magic, gods, and, if they were especially lucky, the Dragon Riders. Carvahall had its
own storyteller, Brom—a friend of Eragon’s—but his tales grew old over the years, whereas the
troubadours always had new ones that he listened to eagerly.
Eragon had just broken off an icicle from the underside of the porch when he spotted Sloan nearby. The
butcher had not seen him, so Eragon ducked his head and bolted around a corner toward Morn’s tavern.
The inside was hot and filled with greasy smoke from sputtering tallow candles. The shiny-black Urgal
horns, their twisted span as great as his outstretched arms, were mounted over the door. The bar was
long and low, with a stack of staves on one end for customers to carve. Morn tended the bar, his sleeves
rolled up to his elbows. The bottom half of his face was short and mashed, as if he had rested his chin on
a grinding wheel. People crowded solid oak tables and listened to two traders who had finished their
business early and had come in for beer.
Morn looked up from a mug he was cleaning. “Eragon! Good to see you. Where’s your uncle?”
“Buying,” said Eragon with a shrug. “He’s going to be a while.”
“And Roran, is he here?” asked Morn as he swiped the cloth through another mug.
“Yes, no sick animals to keep him back this year.”
“Good, good.”
Eragon gestured at the two traders. “Who are they?”
“Grain buyers. They bought everyone’s seed at ridiculously low prices, and now they’re telling wild
stories, expecting us to believe them.”
Eragon understood why Morn was so upset.People need that money. We can’t get by without it. “What

Page 21

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

kind of stories?”
Morn snorted. “They say the Varden have formed a pact with the Urgals and are massing an army to
attack us.Supposedly , it’s only through the grace of our king that we’ve been protected for so long—as
if Galbatorix would care if we burned to the ground… Go listen to them. I have enough on my hands
without explaining their lies.”
The first trader filled a chair with his enormous girth; his every movement caused it to protest loudly.
There was no hint of hair on his face, his pudgy hands were baby smooth, and he had pouting lips that
curled petulantly as he sipped from a flagon. The second man had a florid face. The skin around his jaw
was dry and corpulent, filled with lumps of hard fat, like cold butter gone rancid. Contrasted with his
neck and jowls, the rest of his body was unnaturally thin.
The first trader vainly tried to pull back his expanding borders to fit within the chair. He said, “No, no,
you don’t understand. It is only through the king’s unceasing efforts on your behalf that you are able to
argue with us in safety. If he, in all his wisdom, were to withdraw that support, woe unto you!”
Someone hollered, “Right, why don’t you also tell us the Riders have returned and you’ve each killed a
hundred elves. Do you think we’re children to believe in your tales? We can take care of ourselves.” The
group chuckled.
The trader started to reply when his thin companion intervened with a wave of his hand. Gaudy jewels
flashed on his fingers. “You misunderstand. We know the Empire cannot care for each of us personally,
as you may want, but it can keep Urgals and other abominations from overrunning this,” he searched
vaguely for the right term, “place.”
The trader continued, “You’re angry with the Empire for treating people unfairly, a legitimate concern,
but a government cannot please everyone. There will inevitably be arguments and conflicts. However, the
majority of us have nothing to complain about. Every country has some small group of malcontents who
aren’t satisfied with the balance of power.”
“Yeah,” called a woman, “if you’re willing to call the Varden small!”
The fat man sighed. “We already explained that the Varden have no interest in helping you. That’s only a
falsehood perpetuated by the traitors in an attempt to disrupt the Empire and convince us that the real
threat is inside—not outside—our borders. All they want to do is overthrow the king and take
possession of our land. They have spies everywhere as they prepare to invade. You never know who
might be working for them.”
Eragon did not agree, but the traders’ words were smooth, and people were nodding. He stepped
forward and said, “How do you know this? I can say that clouds are green, but that doesn’t mean it’s
true. Prove you aren’t lying.” The two men glared at him while the villagers waited silently for the answer.
The thin trader spoke first. He avoided Eragon’s eyes. “Aren’t your children taught respect? Or do you
let boys challenge men whenever they want to?”
The listeners fidgeted and stared at Eragon. Then a man said, “Answer the question.”
“It’s only common sense,” said the fat one, sweat beading on his upper lip. His reply riled the villagers,
and the dispute resumed.

Page 22

Eragon returned to the bar with a sour taste in his mouth. He had never before met anyone who favored
the Empire and tore down its enemies. There was a deep-seated hatred of the Empire in Carvahall,
almost hereditary in nature. The Empire never helped them during harsh years when they nearly starved,
and its tax collectors were heartless. He felt justified in disagreeing with the traders regarding the king’s
mercy, but he did speculate about the Varden.
The Varden were a rebel group that constantly raided and attacked the Empire. It was a mystery who
their leader was or who had formed them in the years following Galbatorix’s rise to power over a century
ago. The group had garnered much sympathy as they eluded Galbatorix’s efforts to destroy them. Little
was known about the Varden except that if you were a fugitive and had to hide, or if you hated the
Empire, they would accept you. The only problem was finding them.
Morn leaned over the bar and said, “Incredible, isn’t it? They’re worse than vultures circling a dying
animal. There’s going to be trouble if they stay much longer.”
“For us or for them?”
“Them,” said Morn as angry voices filled the tavern. Eragon left when the argument threatened to
become violent. The door thudded shut behind him, cutting off the voices. It was early evening, and the
sun was sinking rapidly; the houses cast long shadows on the ground. As Eragon headed down the street,
he noticed Roran and Katrina standing in an alley.
Roran said something Eragon could not hear. Katrina looked down at her hands and answered in an
undertone, then leaned up on her tiptoes and kissed him before darting away. Eragon trotted to Roran
and teased, “Having a good time?” Roran grunted noncommittally as he paced away.
“Have you heard the traders’ news?” asked Eragon, following. Most of the villagers were indoors,
talking to traders or waiting until it was dark enough for the troubadours to perform.
“Yes.” Roran seemed distracted. “What do you think of Sloan?”
“I thought it was obvious.”
“There’ll be blood between us when he finds out about Katrina and me,” stated Roran. A snowflake
landed on Eragon’s nose, and he looked up. The sky had turned gray. He could think of nothing
appropriate to say; Roran was right. He clasped his cousin on the shoulder as they continued down the
byway.
Dinner at Horst’s was hearty. The room was full of conversation and laughter. Sweet cordials and heavy
ales were consumed in copious amounts, adding to the boisterous atmosphere. When the plates were
empty, Horst’s guests left the house and strolled to the field where the traders were camped. A ring of
poles topped with candles had been stuck into the ground around a large clearing. Bonfires blazed in the
background, painting the ground with dancing shadows. The villagers slowly gathered around the circle
and waited expectantly in the cold.
The troubadours came tumbling out of their tents, dressed in tasseled clothing, followed by older and
more stately minstrels. The minstrels provided music and narration as their younger counterparts acted
out the stories. The first plays were pure entertainment: bawdy and full of jokes, pratfalls, and ridiculous
characters. Later, however, when the candles sputtered in their sockets and everyone was drawn
together into a tight circle, the old storyteller Brom stepped forward. A knotted white beard rippled over
his chest, and a long black cape was wrapped around his bent shoulders, obscuring his body. He spread

Page 23

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

his arms with hands that reached out like talons and recited thus:
“The sands of time cannot be stopped. Years pass whether we will them or not… but we can
remember. What has been lost may yet live on in memories. That which you will hear is imperfect and
fragmented, yet treasure it, for without you it does not exist. I give you now a memory that has been
forgotten, hidden in the dreamy haze that lies behind us.”
His keen eyes inspected their interested faces. His gaze lingered on Eragon last of all.
“Before your grandfathers’ fathers were born, and yea, even before their fathers, the Dragon Riders
were formed. To protect and guard was their mission, and for thousands of years they succeeded. Their
prowess in battle was unmatched, for each had the strength of ten men. They were immortal unless blade
or poison took them. For good only were their powers used, and under their tutelage tall cities and
towers were built out of the living stone. While they kept peace, the land flourished. It was a golden time.
The elves were our allies, the dwarves our friends. Wealth flowed into our cities, and men prospered. But
weep… for it could not last.”
Brom looked down silently. Infinite sadness resonated in his voice.
“Though no enemy could destroy them, they could not guard against themselves. And it came to pass at
the height of their power that a boy, Galbatorix by name, was born in the province of Inzilbêth, which is
no more. At ten he was tested, as was the custom, and it was found that great power resided in him. The
Riders accepted him as their own.
“Through their training he passed, exceeding all others in skill. Gifted with a sharp mind and strong body,
he quickly took his place among the Riders’ ranks. Some saw his abrupt rise as dangerous and warned
the others, but the Riders had grown arrogant in their power and ignored caution. Alas, sorrow was
conceived that day.
“So it was that soon after his training was finished, Galbatorix took a reckless trip with two friends. Far
north they flew, night and day, and passed into the Urgals’ remaining territory, foolishly thinking their new
powers would protect them. There on a thick sheet of ice, unmelted even in summer, they were
ambushed in their sleep. Though his friends and their dragons were butchered and he suffered great
wounds, Galbatorix slew his attackers. Tragically, during the fight a stray arrow pierced his dragon’s
heart. Without the arts to save her, she died in his arms. Then were the seeds of madness planted.”
The storyteller clasped his hands and looked around slowly, shadows flickering across his worn face.
The next words came like the mournful toll of a requiem.
“Alone, bereft of much of his strength and half mad with loss, Galbatorix wandered without hope in that
desolate land, seeking death. It did not come to him, though he threw himself without fear against any
living thing. Urgals and other monsters soon fled from his haunted form. During this time he came to
realize that the Riders might grant him another dragon. Driven by this thought, he began the arduous
journey, on foot, back through the Spine. Territory he had soared over effortlessly on a dragon’s back
now took him months to traverse. He could hunt with magic, but oftentimes he walked in places where
animals did not travel. Thus when his feet finally left the mountains, he was close to death. A farmer found
him collapsed in the mud and summoned the Riders.
“Unconscious, he was taken to their holdings, and his body healed. He slept for four days. Upon
awakening he gave no sign of his fevered mind. When he was brought before a council convened to
judge him, Galbatorix demanded another dragon. The desperation of the request revealed his dementia,

and the council saw him for what he truly was. Denied his hope, Galbatorix, through the twisted mirror of
his madness, came to believe it was the Riders’ fault his dragon had died. Night after night he brooded on
that and formulated a plan to exact revenge.”
Brom’s words dropped to a mesmerizing whisper.
“He found a sympathetic Rider, and there his insidious words took root. By persistent reasoning and the
use of dark secrets learned from a Shade, he inflamed the Rider against their elders. Together they
treacherously lured and killed an elder. When the foul deed was done, Galbatorix turned on his ally and
slaughtered him without warning. The Riders found him, then, with blood dripping from his hands. A
scream tore from his lips, and he fled into the night. As he was cunning in his madness, they could not find
him.
“For years he hid in wastelands like a hunted animal, always watching for pursuers. His atrocity was not
forgotten, but over time searches ceased. Then through some ill fortune he met a young Rider,
Morzan—strong of body, but weak of mind. Galbatorix convinced Morzan to leave a gate unbolted in
the citadel Ilirea, which is now called Urû’baen. Through this gate Galbatorix entered and stole a dragon
hatchling.
“He and his new disciple hid themselves in an evil place where the Riders dared not venture. There
Morzan entered into a dark apprenticeship, learning secrets and forbidden magic that should never have
been revealed. When his instruction was finished and Galbatorix’s black dragon, Shruikan, was fully
grown, Galbatorix revealed himself to the world, with Morzan at his side. Together they fought any Rider
they met. With each kill their strength grew. Twelve of the Riders joined Galbatorix out of desire for
power and revenge against perceived wrongs. Those twelve, with Morzan, became the Thirteen
Forsworn. The Riders were unprepared and fell beneath the onslaught. The elves, too, fought bitterly
against Galbatorix, but they were overthrown and forced to flee to their secret places, from whence they
come no more.
“Only Vrael, leader of the Riders, could resist Galbatorix and the Forsworn. Ancient and wise, he
struggled to save what he could and keep the remaining dragons from falling to his enemies. In the last
battle, before the gates of Dorú Areaba, Vrael defeated Galbatorix, but hesitated with the final blow.
Galbatorix seized the moment and smote him in the side. Grievously wounded, Vrael fled to Utgard
Mountain, where he hoped to gather strength. But it was not to be, for Galbatorix found him. As they
fought, Galbatorix kicked Vrael in the fork of his legs. With that underhanded blow, he gained dominance
over Vrael and removed his head with a blazing sword.
“Then as power rushed through his veins, Galbatorix anointed himself king over all Alagaësia.
“And from that day, he has ruled us.”

With the completion of the story, Brom shuffled away with the troubadours. Eragon thought he saw a
tear shining on his cheek. People murmured quietly to each other as they departed. Garrow said to
Eragon and Roran, “Consider yourselves fortunate. I have heard this tale only twice in my life. If the
Empire knew that Brom had recited it, he would not live to see a new month.”
FATE’SGIFT
The evening after their return from Carvahall, Eragon decided to test the stone as Merlock had. Alone in

Page 25

his room, he set it on his bed and laid three tools next to it. He started with a wooden mallet and lightly
tapped the stone. It produced a subtle ringing. Satisfied, he picked up the next tool, a heavy leather
hammer. A mournful peal reverberated when it struck. Lastly, he pounded a small chisel against it. The
metal did not chip or scratch the stone, but it produced the clearest sound yet. As the final note died
away, he thought he heard a faint squeak.
Merlock said the stone was hollow; there could be something of value inside. I don’t know how to open
it, though. There must have been a good reason for someone to shape it, but whoever sent the stone into
the Spine hasn’t taken the trouble to retrieve it or doesn’t know where it is. But I don’t believe that a
magician with enough power to transport the stone wouldn’t be able to find it again. So was I meant to
have it?He could not answer the question. Resigned to an unsolvable mystery, he picked up the tools and
returned the stone to its shelf.
That night he was abruptly roused from sleep. He listened carefully. All was quiet. Uneasy, he slid his
hand under the mattress and grasped his knife. He waited a few minutes, then slowly sank back to sleep.
A squeak pierced the silence, tearing him back to wakefulness. He rolled out of bed and yanked the
knife from its sheath. Fumbling with a tinderbox, he lit a candle. The door to his room was closed.
Though the squeak was too loud for a mouse or rat, he still checked under the bed. Nothing. He sat on
the edge of the mattress and rubbed the sleep from his eyes. Another squeak filled the air, and he started
violently.
Where was the noise was coming from? Nothing could be in the floor or walls; they were solid wood.
The same went for his bed, and he would have noticed if anything had crawled into his straw mattress
during the night. His eyes settled on the stone. He took it off the shelf and absently cradled it as he
studied the room. A squeak rang in his ears and reverberated through his fingers; it came from the stone.
The stone had given him nothing but frustration and anger, and now it would not even let him sleep! It
ignored his furious glare and sat solidly, occasionally peeping. Then it gave one very loud squeak and fell
silent. Eragon warily put it away and got back under the sheets. Whatever secret the stone held, it would
have to wait until morning.
The moon was shining through his window when he woke again. The stone was rocking rapidly on the
shelf, knocking against the wall. It was bathed in cool moonlight that bleached its surface. Eragon jumped
out of bed, knife in hand. The motion stopped, but he remained tense. Then the stone started squeaking
and rocking faster than ever.
With an oath, he began dressing. He did not care how valuable the stone might be; he was going to take
it far away and bury it. The rocking stopped; the stone became quiet. It quivered, then rolled forward
and dropped onto the floor with a loud thump. He inched toward the door in alarm as the stone wobbled
toward him.
Suddenly a crack appeared on the stone. Then another and another. Transfixed, Eragon leaned forward,
still holding the knife. At the top of the stone, where all the cracks met, a small piece wobbled, as if it
were balanced on something, then rose and toppled to the floor. After another series of squeaks, a small
dark head poked out of the hole, followed by a weirdly angled body. Eragon gripped the knife tighter
and held very still. Soon the creature was all the way out of the stone. It stayed in place for a moment,
then skittered into the moonlight.
Eragon recoiled in shock. Standing in front of him, licking off the membrane that encased it, was a
dragon.

AWAKENING
The dragon was no longer than his forearm, yet it was dignified and noble. Its scales were deep sapphire
blue, the same color as the stone. But not a stone, he realized, an egg. The dragon fanned its wings; they
were what had made it appear so contorted. The wings were several times longer than its body and
ribbed with thin fingers of bone that extended from the wing’s front edge, forming a line of widely spaced
talons. The dragon’s head was roughly triangular. Two diminutive white fangs curved down out of its
upper jaw. They looked very sharp. Its claws were also white, like polished ivory, and slightly serrated
on the inside curve. A line of small spikes ran down the creature’s spine from the base of its head to the
tip of its tail. A hollow where its neck and shoulders joined created a larger-than-normal gap between the
spikes.
Eragon shifted slightly, and the dragon’s head snapped around. Hard, ice-blue eyes fixed on him. He
kept very still. It might be a formidable enemy if it decided to attack.
The dragon lost interest in Eragon and awkwardly explored the room, squealing as it bumped into a wall
or furniture. With a flutter of wings, it leapt onto the bed and crawled to his pillow, squeaking. Its mouth
was open pitifully, like a young bird’s, displaying rows of pointed teeth. Eragon sat cautiously on the end
of the bed. The dragon smelled his hand, nibbled his sleeve. He pulled his arm back.
A smile tugged at Eragon’s lips as he looked at the small creature. Tentatively, he reached out with his
right hand and touched its flank. A blast of icy energy surged into his hand and raced up his arm, burning
in his veins like liquid fire. He fell back with a wild cry. An iron clang filled his ears, and he heard a
soundless scream of rage. Every part of his body seared with pain. He struggled to move, but was unable
to. After what seemed like hours, warmth seeped back into his limbs, leaving them tingling. Shivering
uncontrollably, he pushed himself upright. His hand was numb, his fingers paralyzed. Alarmed, he
watched as the middle of his palm shimmered and formed a diffused white oval. The skin itched and
burned like a spider bite. His heart pounded frantically.
Eragon blinked, trying to understand what had occurred. Something brushed against his consciousness,
like a finger trailing over his skin. He felt it again, but this time it solidified into a tendril of thought through
which he could feel a growing curiosity. It was as if an invisible wall surrounding his thoughts had fallen
away, and he was now free to reach out with his mind. He was afraid that without anything to hold him
back, he would float out of his body and be unable to return, becoming a spirit of the ether. Scared, he
pulled away from the contact. The new sense vanished as if he had closed his eyes. He glared
suspiciously at the motionless dragon.
A scaly leg scraped against his side, and he jerked back. But the energy did not shock him again.
Puzzled, he rubbed the dragon’s head with his right hand. A light tingling ran up his arm. The dragon
nuzzled him, arching its back like a cat. He slid a finger over its thin wing membranes. They felt like old
parchment, velvety and warm, but still slightly damp. Hundreds of slender veins pulsed through them.
Again the tendril touched his mind, but this time, instead of curiosity, he sensed an overpowering,
ravenous hunger. He got up with a sigh. This was a dangerous animal, of that he was sure. Yet it seemed
so helpless crawling on his bed, he could only wonder if there was any harm in keeping it. The dragon
wailed in a reedy tone as it looked for food. Eragon quickly scratched its head to keep it quiet.I’ll think
about this later, he decided, and left the room, carefully closing the door.
Returning with two strips of dried meat, he found the dragon sitting on the windowsill, watching the
moon. He cut the meat into small squares and offered one to the dragon. It smelled the square cautiously,

Page 27

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

then jabbed its head forward like a snake and snatched the meat from his fingers, swallowing it whole
with a peculiar jerk. The dragon prodded Eragon’s hand for more food.
He fed it, careful to keep his fingers out of the way. By the time there was only one square left, the
dragon’s belly was bulging. He proffered the last piece; the dragon considered it for a moment, then lazily
snapped it up. Done eating, it crawled onto his arm and curled against his chest. Then it snorted, a puff of
dark smoke rising from its nostrils. Eragon looked at it with wonder.
Just when he thought the dragon was asleep, a low humming came from its vibrating throat. Gently, he
carried it to the bed and set it by his pillow. The dragon, eyes closed, wrapped its tail around the bedpost
contentedly. Eragon lay next to it, flexing his hand in the near darkness.
He faced a painful dilemma: By raising a dragon, he could become a Rider. Myths and stories about
Riders were treasured, and being one would automatically place him among those legends. However, if
the Empire discovered the dragon, he and his family would be put to death unless he joined the king. No
one could—or would—help them. The simplest solution was just to kill the dragon, but the idea was
repugnant, and he rejected it. Dragons were too revered for him to even consider that.Besides, what
could betray us? he thought.We live in a remote area and have done nothing to draw attention.
The problem was convincing Garrow and Roran to let him keep the dragon. Neither of them would care
to have a dragon around.I could raise it in secret. In a month or two it will be too large for Garrow to get
rid of, but will he accept it? Even if he does, can I get enough food for the dragon while it’s hiding? It’s
no larger than a small cat, but it ate an entire handful of meat! I suppose it’ll be able to hunt for itself
eventually, but how long until then? Will it be able to survive the cold outside? All the same, he wanted
the dragon. The more he thought about it, the surer he was. However things might work out with
Garrow, Eragon would do everything he could to protect it. Determined, he fell asleep with the dragon
cradled against him.
When dawn came, the dragon was sitting atop his bedpost, like an ancient sentinel welcoming the new
day. Eragon marveled at its color. He had never seen such a clear, hard blue. Its scales were like
hundreds of small gemstones. He noticed that the white oval on his palm, where he had touched the
dragon, had a silvery sheen. He hoped he could hide it by keeping his hands dirty.
The dragon launched off the post and glided to the floor. Eragon gingerly picked it up and left the quiet
house, pausing to grab meat, several leather strips, and as many rags as he could carry. The crisp
morning was beautiful; a fresh layer of snow covered the farm. He smiled as the small creature looked
around with interest from the safety of his arms.
Hurrying across the fields, he walked silently into the dark forest, searching for a safe place for the
dragon to stay. Eventually he found a rowan tree standing alone on a barren knoll, its branches
snow-tipped gray fingers that reached toward the sky. He set the dragon down by the base of the trunk
and shook the leather onto the ground.
With a few deft movements, he made a noose and slipped it over the dragon’s head as it explored the
snowy clumps surrounding the tree. The leather was worn, but it would hold. He watched the dragon
crawl around, then untied the noose from its neck and fashioned a makeshift harness for its legs so the
dragon would not strangle itself. Next he gathered an armful of sticks and built a crude hut high in the
branches, layering the inside with rags and stashing the meat. Snow fell on his face as the tree swayed.
He hung more rags over the front of the shelter to keep heat inside. Pleased, he surveyed his work.
“Time to show you your new home,” he said, and lifted the dragon up into the branches. It wriggled,

Page 28

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

trying to get free, then clambered into the hut, where it ate a piece of meat, curled up, and blinked coyly
at him. “You’ll be fine as long as you stay in here,” he instructed. The dragon blinked again.
Sure that it had not understood him, Eragon groped with his mind until he felt the dragon’s
consciousness. Again he had the terrible feeling ofopenness —of a space so large it pressed down on him
like a heavy blanket. Summoning his strength, he focused on the dragon and tried to impress on it one
idea:Stay here. The dragon stopped moving and cocked its head at him. He pushed harder:Stay here. A
dim acknowledgment came tentatively through the link, but Eragon wondered if it really understood.After
all, it’s only an animal. He retreated from the contact with relief and felt the safety of his own mind
envelop him.
Eragon left the tree, casting glances backward. The dragon stuck its head out of the shelter and watched
with large eyes as he left.
After a hurried walk home, he sneaked back into his room to dispose of the egg fragments. He was sure
Garrow and Roran would not notice the egg’s absence—it had faded from their thoughts after they
learned it could not be sold. When his family got up, Roran mentioned that he had heard some noises
during the night but, to Eragon’s relief, did not pursue the issue.
Eragon’s enthusiasm made the day go by quickly. The mark on his hand proved easy to hide, so he soon
stopped worrying about it. Before long he headed back to the rowan, carrying sausages he had pilfered
from the cellar. With apprehension, he approached the tree.Is the dragon able to survive outside in
winter?
His fears were groundless. The dragon was perched on a branch, gnawing on something between its
front legs. It started squeaking excitedly when it saw him. He was pleased to see that it had remained in
the tree, above the reach of large predators. As soon as he dropped the sausages at the base of the
trunk, the dragon glided down. While it voraciously tore apart the food, Eragon examined the shelter. All
the meat he had left was gone, but the hut was intact, and tufts of feathers littered the floor.Good. It can
get its own food.
It struck him that he did not know if the dragon was a he or a she. He lifted and turned it over, ignoring
its squeals of displeasure, but was unable to find any distinguishing marks.It seems like it won’t give up
any secrets without a struggle.
He spent a long time with the dragon. He untied it, set it on his shoulder, and went to explore the woods.
The snow-laden trees watched over them like solemn pillars of a great cathedral. In that isolation, Eragon
showed the dragon what he knew about the forest, not caring if it understood his meaning. It was the
simple act of sharing that mattered. He talked to it continuously. The dragon gazed back at him with
bright eyes, drinking in his words. For a while he just sat with it resting in his arms and watched it with
wonder, still stunned by recent events. Eragon started for home at sunset, conscious of two hard blue
eyes drilling into his back, indignant at being left behind.
That night he brooded about all the things that could happen to a small and unprotected animal. Thoughts
of ice storms and vicious animals tormented him. It took hours for him to find sleep. His dreams were of
foxes and black wolves tearing at the dragon with bloody teeth.
In the sunrise glow, Eragon ran from the house with food and scraps of cloth—extra insulation for the
shelter. He found the dragon awake and safe, watching the sunrise from high in the tree. He fervently
thanked all the gods, known and unknown. The dragon came down to the ground as he approached and
leapt into his arms, huddling close to his chest. The cold had not harmed it, but it seemed frightened. A

puff of dark smoke blew out of its nostrils. He stroked it comfortingly and sat with his back to the rowan,
murmuring softly. He kept still as the dragon buried its head in his coat. After a while it crawled out of his
embrace and onto his shoulder. He fed it, then wrapped the new rags around the hut. They played
together for a time, but Eragon had to return to the house before long.
A smooth routine was quickly established. Every morning Eragon ran out to the tree and gave the
dragon breakfast before hurrying back. During the day he attacked his chores until they were finished and
he could visit the dragon again. Both Garrow and Roran noted his behavior and asked why he spent so
much time outside. Eragon just shrugged and started checking to make sure he was not followed to the
tree.
After the first few days he stopped worrying that a mishap would befall the dragon. Its growth was
explosive; it would soon be safe from most dangers. The dragon doubled in size in the first week. Four
days later it was as high as his knee. It no longer fit inside the hut in the rowan, so Eragon was forced to
build a hidden shelter on the ground. The task took him three days.
When the dragon was a fortnight old, Eragon was compelled to let it roam free because it needed so
much food. The first time he untied it, only the force of his will kept it from following him back to the
farm. Every time it tried, he pushed it away with his mind until it learned to avoid the house and its other
inhabitants.
And he impressed on the dragon the importance of hunting only in the Spine, where there was less
chance of being seen. Farmers would notice if game started disappearing from Palancar Valley. It made
him feel both safer and uneasy when the dragon was so far away.
The mental contact he shared with the dragon waxed stronger each day. He found that although it did
not comprehend words, he could communicate with it through images or emotions. It was an imprecise
method, however, and he was often misunderstood. The range at which they could touch each other’s
thoughts expanded rapidly. Soon Eragon could contact the dragon anywhere within three leagues. He
often did so, and the dragon, in turn, would lightly brush against his mind. These mute conversations filled
his working hours. There was always a small part of him connected to the dragon, ignored at times, but
never forgotten. When he talked with people, the contact was distracting, like a fly buzzing in his ear.
As the dragon matured, its squeaks deepened to a roar and the humming became a low rumble, yet the
dragon did not breathe fire, which concerned him. He had seen it blow smoke when it was upset, but
there was never a hint of flame.
When the month ended, Eragon’s elbow was level with the dragon’s shoulder. In that brief span, it had
transformed from a small, weak animal into a powerful beast. Its hard scales were as tough as chain-mail
armor, its teeth like daggers.
Eragon took long walks in the evening with the dragon padding beside him. When they found a clearing,
he would settle against a tree and watch the dragon soar through the air. He loved to see it fly and
regretted that it was not yet big enough to ride. He often sat beside the dragon and rubbed its neck,
feeling sinews and corded muscles flex under his hands.
Despite Eragon’s efforts, the forest around the farm filled with signs of the dragon’s existence. It was
impossible to erase all the huge four-clawed footprints sunk deep in the snow, and he refused even to try
to hide the giant dung heaps that were becoming far too common. The dragon had rubbed against trees,
stripping off the bark, and had sharpened its claws on dead logs, leaving gashes inches deep. If Garrow

Page 30

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

or Roran went too far beyond the farm’s boundaries, they would discover the dragon. Eragon could
imagine no worse way for the truth to come out, so he decided to preempt it by explaining everything to
them.
He wanted to do two things first, though: give the dragon a suitable name and learn more about dragons
in general. To that end he needed to talk with Brom, master of epics and legends—the only places where
dragonlore survived.
So when Roran went to get a chisel repaired in Carvahall, Eragon volunteered to go with him.
The evening before they left, Eragon went to a small clearing in the forest and called the dragon with his
mind. After a moment he saw a fast-moving speck in the dusky sky. The dragon dived toward him,
pulled up sharply, then leveled off above the trees. He heard a low-pitched whistle as air rushed over its
wings. It banked slowly to his left and spiraled gently down to the ground. The dragon back-flapped for
balance with a deep, muffledthwump as it landed.
Eragon opened his mind, still uncomfortable with the strange sensation, and told the dragon that he was
leaving. It snorted with unease. He attempted to soothe it with a calming mental picture, but the dragon
whipped its tail, unsatisfied. He rested his hand on its shoulder and tried to radiate peace and serenity.
Scales bumped under his fingers as he patted it gently.
A single word rang in his head, deep and clear.
Eragon.
It was solemn and sad, as if an unbreakable pact were being sealed. He stared at the dragon and a cold
tingle ran down his arm.
Eragon.
A hard knot formed in his stomach as unfathomable sapphire eyes gazed back at him. For the first time
he did not think of the dragon as an animal. It was something else, something… different. He raced
home, trying to escape the dragon.My dragon.
Eragon.
TEA FORTWO
Roran and Eragon parted at the outskirts of Carvahall. Eragon walked slowly to Brom’s house,
engrossed in his thoughts. He stopped at the doorstep and raised his hand to knock.
A voice rasped, “What do you want, boy?”
He whirled around. Behind him Brom leaned on a twisted staff embellished with strange carvings. He
wore a brown hooded robe like a friar. A pouch hung from the scuffed leather belt clasped around his
waist. Above his white beard, a proud eagle nose hooked over his mouth and dominated his face. He
peered at Eragon with deep-set eyes shadowed by a gnarled brow and waited for his reply.
“To get information,” Eragon said. “Roran is getting a chisel fixed and I had free time, so I came to see if
you could answer a few questions.”

Page 31

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

The old man grunted and reached for the door. Eragon noticed a gold ring on his right hand. Light glinted
off a sapphire, highlighting a strange symbol carved on its face. “You might as well come in; we’ll be
talking awhile. Your questions never seem to end.” Inside, the house was darker than charcoal, an acrid
smell heavy in the air. “Now, for a light.” Eragon heard the old man move around, then a low curse as
something crashed to the floor. “Ah, here we go.” A white spark flashed; a flame wavered into existence.
Brom stood with a candle before a stone fireplace. Stacks of books surrounded a high-backed, deeply
carved wooden chair that faced the mantel; the four legs were shaped like eagle claws, and the seat and
back were padded with leather embossed with a swirling rose pattern. A cluster of lesser chairs held
piles of scrolls. Ink pots and pens were scattered across a writing desk. “Make room for yourself, but by
the lost kings, becareful . This stuff is valuable.”
Eragon stepped over pages of parchment covered with angular runes. He gently lifted cracking scrolls
off a chair and placed them on the floor. A cloud of dust flew into the air as he sat. He stifled a sneeze.
Brom bent down and lit the fire with his candle. “Good! Nothing like sitting by a fire for conversation.”
He threw back his hood to reveal hair that was not white, but silver, then hung a kettle over the flames
and settled into the high-backed chair.
“Now, what do you want?” He addressed Eragon roughly, but not unkindly.
“Well,” said Eragon, wondering how best to approach the subject, “I keep hearing about the Dragon
Riders and their supposed accomplishments. Most everyone seems to want them to return, but I’ve
never heard tell of how they were started, where the dragons came from, or what made the Riders
special—aside from the dragons.”
“A vast subject to tell about,” grumbled Brom. He peered at Eragon alertly. “If I told you their whole
story, we would still be sitting here when winter comes again. It will have to be reduced to a manageable
length. But before we start properly, I need my pipe.”
Eragon waited patiently as Brom tamped down the tobacco. He liked Brom. The old man was irascible
at times, but he never seemed to mind taking time for Eragon. Eragon had once asked him where he
came from, and Brom had laughed, saying, “A village much like Carvahall, only not quite as interesting.”
Curiosity aroused, Eragon asked his uncle. But Garrow could only tell him that Brom had bought a house
in Carvahall nearly fifteen years ago and had lived there quietly ever since.
Brom used a tinderbox to light the pipe. He puffed a few times, then said, “There… we won’t have to
stop, except for the tea. Now, about the Riders, or the Shur’tugal, as they are called by the elves. Where
to start? They spanned countless years and, at the height of their power, held sway over twice the
Empire’s lands. Numerous stories have been told about them, most nonsense. If you believed everything
said, you would expect them to have the powers of a lesser god. Scholars have devoted entire lives to
separating these fictions from fact, but it’s doubtful any of them will succeed. However, it isn’t an
impossible task if we confine ourselves to the three areas you specified: how the Riders began, why they
were so highly regarded, and where dragons came from. I shall start with the last item.” Eragon settled
back and listened to the man’s mesmerizing voice.
“Dragons have no beginning, unless it lies with the creation of Alagaësia itself. And if they have an end, it
will be when this world perishes, for they suffer as the land does. They, the dwarves, and a few others
are the true inhabitants of this land. They lived here before all others, strong and proud in their elemental
glory. Their world was unchanging until the first elves sailed over the sea on their silver ships.”

Page 32

“Where did the elves come from?” interrupted Eragon. “And why are they called the fair folk? Do they
really exist?”
Brom scowled. “Do you want your original questions answered or not? They won’t be if you want to
explore every obscure piece of knowledge.”
“Sorry,” said Eragon. He dipped his head and tried to look contrite.
“No, you’re not,” said Brom with some amusement. He shifted his gaze to the fire and watched it lick
the underside of the kettle. “If you must know, elves are not legends, and they are called the fair folk
because they are more graceful than any of the other races. They come from what they call Alalea,
though none but they know what, or even where, it is.
“Now,” he glared from under his bushy eyebrows to make sure there would be no more interruptions,
“the elves were a proud race then, and strong in magic. At first they regarded dragons as mere animals.
From that belief rose a deadly mistake. A brash elven youth hunted down a dragon, as he would a stag,
and killed it. Outraged, the dragons ambushed and slaughtered the elf. Unfortunately, the bloodletting did
not stop there. The dragons massed together and attacked the entire elven nation. Dismayed by the
terrible misunderstanding, the elves tried to end the hostilities, but couldn’t find a way to communicate
with the dragons.
“Thus, to greatly abbreviate a complicated series of occurrences, there was a very long and very bloody
war, which both sides later regretted. At the beginning the elves fought only to defend themselves, for
they were reluctant to escalate the fighting, but the dragons’ ferocity eventually forced them to attack for
their own survival. This lasted for five years and would have continued for much longer if an elf called
Eragon hadn’t found a dragon egg.” Eragon blinked in surprise. “Ah, I see you didn’t know of your
namesake,” said Brom.
“No.” The teakettle whistled stridently.Why was I named after an elf?
“Then you should find this all the more interesting,” said Brom. He hooked the kettle out of the fire and
poured boiling water into two cups. Handing one to Eragon, he warned, “These leaves don’t need to
steep long, so drink it quickly before it gets too strong.” Eragon tried a sip, but scalded his tongue. Brom
set his own cup aside and continued smoking the pipe.
“No one knows why that egg was abandoned. Some say the parents were killed in an elven attack.
Others believe the dragons purposefully left it there. Either way, Eragon saw the value of raising a friendly
dragon. He cared for it secretly and, in the custom of the ancient language, named him Bid’Daum. When
Bid’Daum had grown to a good size, they traveled together among the dragons and convinced them to
live in peace with the elves. Treaties were formed between the two races. To ensure that war would
never break out again, they decided that it was necessary to establish the Riders.
“At first the Riders were intended merely as a means of communication between the elves and dragons.
However, as time passed, their worth was recognized and they were given ever more authority.
Eventually they took the island Vroengard for their home and built a city on it—Dorú Areaba. Before
Galbatorix overthrew them, the Riders held more power than all the kings in Alagaësia. Now I believe I
have answered two of your questions.”
“Yes,” said Eragon absently. It seemed like an incredible coincidence that he had been named after the
first Rider. For some reason his name did not feel the same anymore. “What doesEragon mean?”

“I don’t know,” said Brom. “It’s very old. I doubt anyone remembers except the elves, and fortune
would have to smile greatly before you talked with one. It is a good name to have, though; you should be
proud of it. Not everyone has one so honorable.”
Eragon brushed the matter from his mind and focused on what he had learned from Brom; there was
something missing. “I don’t understand. Where were we when the Riders were created?”
“We?” asked Brom, raising an eyebrow.
“You know, all of us.” Eragon waved his hands vaguely. “Humans in general.”
Brom laughed. “We are no more native to this land than the elves. It took our ancestors another three
centuries to arrive here and join the Riders.”
“That can’t be,” protested Eragon. “We’ve always lived in Palancar Valley.”
“That might be true for a few generations, but beyond that, no. It isn’t even true for you, Eragon,” said
Brom gently. “Though you consider yourself part of Garrow’s family, and rightly so, your sire was not
from here. Ask around and you’ll find many people who haven’t been here that long. This valley is old
and hasn’t always belonged to us.”
Eragon scowled and gulped at the tea. It was still hot enough to burn his throat. This was his home,
regardless of who his father was! “What happened to the dwarves after the Riders were destroyed?”
“No one really knows. They fought with the Riders through the first few battles, but when it became
clear Galbatorix was going to win, they sealed all the known entrances to their tunnels and disappeared
underground. As far as I know, not one has been seen since.”
“And the dragons?” he asked. “What of them? Surely they weren’t all killed.”
Brom answered sorrowfully, “That is the greatest mystery in Alagaësia nowadays: How many dragons
survived Galbatorix’s murderous slaughter? He spared those who agreed to serve him, but only the
twisted dragons of the Forsworn would assist his madness. If any dragons aside from Shruikan are still
alive, they have hidden themselves so they will never be found by the Empire.”
So wheredidmy dragon come from? wondered Eragon. “Were the Urgals here when the elves came to
Alagaësia?” he asked.
“No, they followed the elves across the sea, like ticks seeking blood. They were one of the reasons the
Riders became valued for their battle prowess and ability to keep the peace… Much can be learned
from this history. It’s a pity the king makes it a delicate subject,” reflected Brom.
“Yes, I heard your story the last time I was in town.”
“Story!” roared Brom. Lightning flashed in his eyes. “If it is a story, then the rumors of my death are true
and you are speaking with a ghost! Respect the past; you never know how it may affect you.”
Eragon waited until Brom’s face mellowed before he dared ask, “How big were the dragons?”
A dark plume of smoke swirled above Brom like a miniature thunderstorm. “Larger than a house. Even

Page 34

the small ones had wingspans over a hundred feet; they never stopped growing. Some of the ancient
ones, before the Empire killed them, could have passed for large hills.”
Dismay swept through Eragon.How can I hide my dragon in the years to come? He raged silently, but
kept his voice calm. “When did they mature?”
“Well,” said Brom, scratching his chin, “they couldn’t breathe fire until they were around five to six
months old, which was about when they could mate. The older a dragon was, the longer it could breathe
fire. Some of them could keep at it for minutes.” Brom blew a smoke ring and watched it float up to the
ceiling.
“I heard that their scales shone like gems.”
Brom leaned forward and growled, “You heard right. They came in every color and shade. It was said
that a group of them looked like a living rainbow, constantly shifting and shimmering. But who told you
that?”
Eragon froze for a second, then lied, “A trader.”
“What was his name?” asked Brom. His tangled eyebrows met in a thick white line; the wrinkles
deepened on his forehead. Unnoticed, the pipe smoldered out.
Eragon pretended to think. “I don’t know. He was talking in Morn’s, but I never found out who he
was.”
“I wish you had,” muttered Brom.
“He also said a Rider could hear his dragon’s thoughts,” said Eragon quickly, hoping that the fictitious
trader would protect him from suspicion.
Brom’s eyes narrowed. Slowly he took out a tinderbox and struck the flint. Smoke rose, and he took a
long pull from the pipe, exhaling slowly. In a flat voice he said, “He was wrong. It isn’t in any of the
stories, and I know them all. Did he say anything else?”
Eragon shrugged. “No.” Brom was too interested in the trader for him to continue the falsehood.
Casually he inquired, “Did dragons live very long?”
Brom did not respond at once. His chin sank to his chest while his fingers tapped the pipe thoughtfully,
light reflecting off his ring. “Sorry, my mind was elsewhere. Yes, a dragon will live for quite a while,
forever, in fact, as long as it isn’t killed and its Rider doesn’t die.”
“How does anyone know that?” objected Eragon. “If dragons die when their Riders do, they could only
live to be sixty or seventy. You said during your… narration that Riders lived for hundreds of years, but
that’s impossible.” It troubled him to think of outliving his family and friends.
A quiet smile curled Brom’s lips as he said slyly, “What is possible is subjective. Some would say that
you cannot travel through the Spine and live, yet you do. It’s a matter of perspective. You must be very
wise to know so much at such a young age.” Eragon flushed, and the old man chuckled. “Don’t be angry;
you can’t be expected to know such things. You forget that the dragons were magical—they affected
everything around them in strange ways. The Riders were closest to them and experienced this the most.
The most common side effect was an extended life. Our king has lived long enough to make that

apparent, but most people attribute it to his own magical abilities. There were also other, less noticeable
changes. All the Riders were stronger of body, keener of mind, and truer of sight than normal men. Along
with this, a human Rider would slowly acquire pointed ears, though they were never as prominent as an
elf’s.”
Eragon had to stop his hand from reaching up to feel the tips of his ears.How else will this dragon change
my life? Not only has it gotten inside my head, but it’s altering my body as well! “Were dragons very
smart?”
“Didn’t you pay attention to what I told you earlier!” demanded Brom. “How could the elves form
agreements and peace treaties with dumb brutes? They were as intelligent as you or I.”
“But they were animals,” persisted Eragon.
Brom snorted. “They were no more animals than we are. For some reason people praise everything the
Riders did, yet ignore the dragons, assuming that they were nothing more than an exotic means to get
from one town to another. They weren’t. The Riders’ great deeds were only possible because of the
dragons. How many men would draw their swords if they knew a giant fire-breathing lizard—one with
more natural cunning and wisdom than even a king could hope for—would soon be there to stop the
violence? Hmm?” He blew another smoke ring and watched it waft away.
“Did you ever see one?”
“Nay,” said Brom, “it was long before my time.”
And now for a name.“I’ve been trying to recall the name of a certain dragon, but it keeps eluding me. I
think I heard it when the traders were in Carvahall, but I’m not sure. Could you help me?”
Brom shrugged and quickly listed a stream of names. “There was Jura, Hírador, and Fundor—who
fought the giant sea snake. Galzra, Briam, Ohen the Strong, Gretiem, Beroan, Roslarb…” He added
many others. At the very end, he uttered so softly Eragon almost did not hear, “… and Saphira.” Brom
quietly emptied his pipe. “Was it any of those?”
“I’m afraid not,” said Eragon. Brom had given him much to think about, and it was getting late. “Well,
Roran’s probably finished with Horst. I should get back, though I’d rather not.”
Brom raised an eyebrow. “What, is that it? I expected to be answering your questions until he came
looking for you. No queries about dragon battle tactics or requests for descriptions of breathtaking aerial
combat? Are we done?”
“For now,” laughed Eragon. “I learned what I wanted to and more.” He stood and Brom followed.
“Very well, then.” He ushered Eragon to the door. “Goodbye. Take care. And don’t forget, if you
remember who that trader was, tell me.”
“I will. Thank you.” Eragon stepped into the glaring winter sunlight, squinting. He slowly paced away,
pondering what he had heard.
A NAME OFPOWER
On the way home Roran said, “There was a stranger from Therinsford at Horst’s today.”

Page 36

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“What’s his name?” asked Eragon. He sidestepped a patch of ice and continued walking at a brisk
pace. His cheeks and eyes burned from the cold.
“Dempton. He came here to have Horst forge him some sockets,” said Roran. His stocky legs plowed
through a drift, clearing the way for Eragon.
“Doesn’t Therinsford have its own smith?”
“Yes,” replied Roran, “but he isn’t skilled enough.” He glanced at Eragon. With a shrug he added,
“Dempton needs the sockets for his mill. He’s expanding it and offered me a job. If I accept, I’ll leave
with him when he picks up the sockets.”
Millers worked all year. During winter they ground whatever people brought them, but in harvest season
they bought grain and sold it as flour. It was hard, dangerous work; workers often lost fingers or hands to
the giant millstones. “Are you going to tell Garrow?” asked Eragon.
“Yes.” A grimly amused smile played across Roran’s face.
“What for? You know what he thinks about us going away. It’ll only cause trouble if you say anything.
Forget about it so we can eat tonight’s dinner in peace.”
“I can’t. I’m going to take the job.”
Eragon halted. “Why?” They faced each other, their breath visible in the air. “I know money is hard to
come by, but we always manage to survive. You don’t have to leave.”
“No, I don’t. But the money is for myself.” Roran tried to resume walking, but Eragon refused to budge.
“What do you need it for?” he demanded.
Roran’s shoulders straightened slightly. “I want to marry.”
Bewilderment and astonishment overwhelmed Eragon. He remembered seeing Katrina and Roran
kissing during the traders’ visit, but marriage? “Katrina?” he asked weakly, just to confirm. Roran
nodded. “Have you asked her?”
“Not yet, but come spring, when I can raise a house, I will.”
“There’s too much work on the farm for you to leave now,” protested Eragon. “Wait until we’re ready
for planting.”
“No,” said Roran, laughing slightly. “Spring’s the time I’ll be needed the most. The ground will have to
be furrowed and sown. The crops must be weeded—not to mention all the other chores. No, this is the
best time for me to go, when all we really do is wait for the seasons to change. You and Garrow can
make do without me. If all goes well, I’ll soon be back working on the farm, with a wife.”
Eragon reluctantly conceded that Roran made sense. He shook his head, but whether with amazement
or anger, he knew not. “I guess I can only wish you the best of luck. But Garrow may take this with ill
humor.”

Page 37

“We will see.”
They resumed walking, the silence a barrier between them. Eragon’s heart was disturbed. It would take
time before he could look upon this development with favor. When they arrived home, Roran did not tell
Garrow of his plans, but Eragon was sure that he soon would.
Eragon went to see the dragon for the first time since it had spoken to him. He approached
apprehensively, aware now that it was an equal.
Eragon.
“Is that all you can say?” he snapped.
Yes.
His eyes widened at the unexpected reply, and he sat down roughly.Now it has a sense of humor. What
next? Impulsively, he broke a dead branch with his foot. Roran’s announcement had put him in a foul
mood. A questioning thought came from the dragon, so he told it what had happened. As he talked his
voice grew steadily louder until he was yelling pointlessly into the air. He ranted until his emotions were
spent, then ineffectually punched the ground.
“I don’t want him to go, that’s all,” he said helplessly. The dragon watched impassively, listening and
learning. Eragon mumbled a few choice curses and rubbed his eyes. He looked at the dragon
thoughtfully. “You need a name. I heard some interesting ones today; perhaps you’ll like one.” He
mentally ran through the list Brom had given him until he found two names that struck him as heroic,
noble, and pleasing to the ear. “What do you think of Vanilor or his successor, Eridor? Both were great
dragons.”
No,said the dragon. It sounded amused with his efforts.Eragon.
“That’smy name; you can’t have it,” he said, rubbing his chin. “Well, if you don’t like those, there are
others.” He continued through the list, but the dragon rejected every one he proposed. It seemed to be
laughing at something Eragon did not understand, but he ignored it and kept suggesting names. “There
was Ingothold, he slew the…” A revelation stopped him.That’s the problem! I’ve been choosing male
names. You are a she!
Yes.The dragon folded her wings smugly.
Now that he knew what to look for, he came up with half a dozen names. He toyed with Miremel, but
that did not fit—after all, it was the name of a brown dragon. Opheila and Lenora were also discarded.
He was about to give up when he remembered the last name Brom had muttered. Eragon liked it, but
would the dragon?
He asked.
“Are you Saphira?” She looked at him with intelligent eyes. Deep in his mind he felt her satisfaction.
Yes.Something clicked in his head and her voice echoed, as if from a great distance. He grinned in
response. Saphira started humming.

A MILLER-TO-BE
The sun had set by the time dinner was served. A blustery wind howled outside, shaking the house.
Eragon eyed Roran closely and waited for the inevitable. Finally: “I was offered a job at Therinsford’s
mill… which I plan to take.”
Garrow finished his mouthful of food with deliberate slowness and laid down his fork. He leaned back in
his chair, then interlaced his fingers behind his head and uttered one dry word, “Why?”
Roran explained while Eragon absently picked at his food.
“I see,” was Garrow’s only comment. He fell silent and stared at the ceiling. No one moved as they
awaited his response. “Well, when do you leave?”
“What?” asked Roran.
Garrow leaned forward with a twinkle in his eye. “Did you think I would stop you? I’d hoped you would
marry soon. It will be good to see this family growing again. Katrina will be lucky to have you.”
Astonishment raced over Roran’s face, then he settled into a relieved grin. “So when do you leave?”
Garrow asked.
Roran regained his voice. “When Dempton returns to get the sockets for the mill.”
Garrow nodded. “And that will be in… ?”
“Two weeks.”
“Good. That will give us time to prepare. It’ll be different to have the house to ourselves. But if nothing
goes amiss, it shouldn’t be for too long.” He looked over the table and asked, “Eragon, did you know of
this?”
He shrugged ruefully. “Not until today… It’s madness.”
Garrow ran a hand over his face. “It’s life’s natural course.” He pushed himself up from the chair. “All
will be fine; time will settle everything. For now, though, let’s clean the dishes.” Eragon and Roran helped
him in silence.
The next few days were trying. Eragon’s temper was frayed. Except for curtly answering direct
questions, he spoke with no one. There were small reminders everywhere that Roran was leaving:
Garrow making him a pack, things missing from the walls, and a strange emptiness that filled the house. It
was almost a week before he realized that distance had grown between Roran and him. When they
spoke, the words did not come easily and their conversations were uncomfortable.
Saphira was a balm for Eragon’s frustration. He could talk freely with her; his emotions were completely
open to her mind, and she understood him better than anyone else. During the weeks before Roran’s
departure, she went through another growth spurt. She gained twelve inches at the shoulder, which was
now higher than Eragon’s. He found that the small hollow where her neck joined her shoulders was a
perfect place to sit. He often rested there in the evenings and scratched her neck while he explained the
meanings of different words. Soon she understood everything he said and frequently commented on it.

Page 39

For Eragon, this part of his life was delightful. Saphira was as real and complex as any person. Her
personality was eclectic and at times completely alien, yet they understood each other on a profound
level. Her actions and thoughts constantly revealed new aspects of her character. Once she caught an
eagle and, instead of eating it, released it, saying,No hunter of the sky should end his days as prey. Better
to die on the wing than pinned to the ground.
Eragon’s plan to let his family see Saphira was dispelled by Roran’s announcement and Saphira’s own
cautionary words. She was reluctant to be seen, and he, partly out of selfishness, agreed. The moment
her existence was divulged, he knew that shouts, accusations, and fear would be directed at him… so he
procrastinated. He told himself to wait for a sign that it was the right time.
The night before Roran was to leave, Eragon went to talk with him. He stalked down the hallway to
Roran’s open door. An oil lamp rested on a nightstand, painting the walls with warm flickering light. The
bedposts cast elongated shadows on empty shelves that rose to the ceiling. Roran—his eyes shaded and
the back of his neck tense—was rolling blankets around his clothes and belongings. He paused, then
picked up something from the pillow and bounced it in his hand. It was a polished rock Eragon had given
him years ago. Roran started to tuck it into the bundle, then stopped and set it on a shelf. A hard lump
formed in Eragon’s throat, and he left.
STRANGERS INCARVAHALL
Breakfast was cold, but the tea was hot. Ice inside the windows had melted with the morning fire and
soaked into the wood floor, staining it with dark puddles. Eragon looked at Garrow and Roran by the
kitchen stove and reflected that this would be the last time he saw them together for many months.
Roran sat in a chair, lacing his boots. His full pack rested on the floor next to him. Garrow stood
between them with his hands stuck deep into his pockets. His shirt hung loosely; his skin looked drawn.
Despite the young men’s cajoling, he refused to go with them. When pressed for a reason, he only said
that it was for the best.
“Do you have everything?” Garrow asked Roran.
“Yes.”
He nodded and took a small pouch from his pocket. Coins clinked as he handed it to Roran. “I’ve been
saving this for you. It isn’t much, but if you wish to buy some bauble or trinket, it will suffice.”
“Thank you, but I won’t be spending my money on trifles,” said Roran.
“Do what you will; it is yours,” said Garrow. “I’ve nothing else to give you, except a father’s blessing.
Take it if you wish, but it is worth little.”
Roran’s voice was thick with emotion. “I would be honored to receive it.”
“Then do, and go in peace,” said Garrow, and kissed him on the forehead. He turned and said in a
louder voice, “Do not think that I have forgotten you, Eragon. I have words for both of you. It’s time I
said them, as you are entering the world. Heed them and they will serve you well.” He bent his gaze
sternly on them. “First, let no one rule your mind or body. Take special care that your thoughts remain
unfettered. One may be a free man and yet be bound tighter than a slave. Give men your ear, but not
your heart. Show respect for those in power, but don’t follow them blindly. Judge with logic and reason,
but comment not.

Page 40

“Consider none your superior, whatever their rank or station in life. Treat all fairly or they will seek
revenge. Be careful with your money. Hold fast to your beliefs and others will listen.” He continued at a
slower pace, “Of the affairs of love… my only advice is to be honest. That’s your most powerful tool to
unlock a heart or gain forgiveness. That is all I have to say.” He seemed slightly self-conscious of his
speech.
He hoisted Roran’s pack. “Now you must go. Dawn is approaching, and Dempton will be waiting.”
Roran shouldered the pack and hugged Garrow. “I will return as soon as I can,” he said.
“Good!” replied Garrow. “But now go and don’t worry about us.”
They parted reluctantly. Eragon and Roran went outside, then turned and waved. Garrow raised a bony
hand, his eyes grave, and watched as they trudged to the road. After a long moment he shut the door. As
the sound carried through the morning air, Roran halted.
Eragon looked back and surveyed the land. His eyes lingered on the lone buildings. They looked pitifully
small and fragile. A thin finger of smoke trailing up from the house was the only proof that the snowbound
farm was inhabited.
“There is our whole world,” Roran observed somberly.
Eragon shivered impatiently and grumbled, “A good one too.” Roran nodded, then straightened his
shoulders and headed into his new future. The house disappeared from view as they descended the hill.
It was still early when they reached Carvahall, but they found the smithy doors already open. The air
inside was pleasantly warm. Baldor slowly worked two large bellows attached to the side of a stone
forge filled with sparkling coals. Before the forge stood a black anvil and an iron-bound barrel filled with
brine. From a line of neck-high poles protruding from the walls hung rows of items: giant tongs, pliers,
hammers in every shape and weight, chisels, angles, center punches, files, rasps, lathes, bars of iron and
steel waiting to be shaped, vises, shears, picks, and shovels. Horst and Dempton stood next to a long
table.
Dempton approached with a smile beneath his flamboyant red mustache. “Roran! I’m glad you came.
There’s going to be more work than I can handle with my new grindstones. Are you ready to go?”
Roran hefted his pack. “Yes. Do we leave soon?”
“I’ve a few things to take care of first, but we’ll be off within the hour.” Eragon shifted his feet as
Dempton turned to him, tugging at the corner of his mustache. “You must be Eragon. I would offer you a
job too, but Roran got the only one. Maybe in a year or two, eh?”
Eragon smiled uneasily and shook his hand. The man was friendly. Under other circumstances Eragon
would have liked him, but right then, he sourly wished that the miller had never come to Carvahall.
Dempton huffed. “Good, very good.” He returned his attention to Roran and started to explain how a mill
worked.
“They’re ready to go,” interrupted Horst, gesturing at the table where several bundles rested. “You can
take them whenever you want to.” They shook hands, then Horst left the smithy, beckoning to Eragon on

Page 41

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

the way out.
Interested, Eragon followed. He found the smith standing in the street with his arms crossed. Eragon
thrust his thumb back toward the miller and asked, “What do you think of him?”
Horst rumbled, “A good man. He’ll do fine with Roran.” He absently brushed metal filings off his apron,
then put a massive hand on Eragon’s shoulder. “Lad, do you remember the fight you had with Sloan?”
“If you’re asking about payment for the meat, I haven’t forgotten.”
“No, I trust you, lad. What I wanted to know is if you still have that blue stone.”
Eragon’s heart fluttered.Why does he want to know? Maybe someone saw Saphira! Struggling not to
panic, he said, “I do, but why do you ask?”
“As soon as you return home, get rid of it.” Horst overrode Eragon’s exclamation. “Two men arrived
here yesterday. Strange fellows dressed in black and carrying swords. It made my skin crawl just to look
at them. Last evening they started asking people if a stone like yours had been found. They’re at it again
today.” Eragon blanched. “No one with any sense said anything. They know trouble when they see it, but
I could name a few people who will talk.”
Dread filled Eragon’s heart. Whoever had sent the stone into the Spine had finally tracked it down. Or
perhaps the Empire had learned of Saphira. He did not know which would be worse.Think! Think! The
egg is gone. It’s impossible for them to find it now. But if they know what it was, it’ll be obvious what
happened… Saphira might be in danger! It took all of his self-control to retain a casual air. “Thanks for
telling me. Do you know where they are?” He was proud that his voice barely trembled.
“I didn’t warn you because I thought you needed to meet those men! Leave Carvahall. Go home.”
“All right,” said Eragon to placate the smith, “if you think I should.”
“I do.” Horst’s face softened. “I may be overreacting, but these strangers give me a bad feeling. It would
be better if you stay home until they leave. I’ll try to keep them away from your farm, though it may not
do any good.”
Eragon looked at him gratefully. He wished he could tell him about Saphira. “I’ll leave now,” he said,
and hurried back to Roran. Eragon clasped his cousin’s arm and bade him farewell.
“Aren’t you going to stay awhile?” Roran asked with surprise.
Eragon almost laughed. For some reason, the question struck him as funny. “There’s nothing for me to
do, and I’m not going to stand around until you go.”
“Well,” said Roran doubtfully, “I guess this is the last time we’ll see each other for a few months.”
“I’m sure it won’t seem that long,” said Eragon hastily. “Take care and come back soon.” He hugged
Roran, then left. Horst was still in the street. Aware that the smith was watching, Eragon headed to the
outskirts of Carvahall. Once the smithy was out of sight, he ducked behind a house and sneaked back
through the village.
Eragon kept to the shadows as he searched each street, listening for the slightest noise. His thoughts

Page 42

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

flashed to his room, where his bow hung; he wished that it was in his hand. He prowled across Carvahall,
avoiding everyone until he heard a sibilant voice from around a house. Although his ears were keen, he
had to strain to hear what was being said.
“When did this happen?” The words were smooth, like oiled glass, and seemed to worm their way
through the air. Underlying the speech was a strange hiss that made his scalp prickle.
“About three months ago,” someone else answered. Eragon identified him as Sloan.
Shade’s blood, he’s telling them…He resolved to punch Sloan the next time they met.
A third person spoke. The voice was deep and moist. It conjured up images of creeping decay, mold,
and other things best left untouched. “Are you sure? We would hate to think you had made a mistake. If
that were so, it would be most… unpleasant.” Eragon could imagine only too well what they might do.
Would anyone but the Empire dare threaten people like that? Probably not, but whoever sent the egg
might be powerful enough to use force with impunity.
“Yeah, I’m sure. He had it then. I’m not lying. Plenty of people know about it. Go ask them.” Sloan
sounded shaken. He said something else that Eragon did not catch.
“They have been… rather uncooperative.” The words were derisive. There was a pause. “Your
information has been helpful. We will not forget you.” Eragon believed him.
Sloan muttered something, then Eragon heard someone hurrying away. He peered around the corner to
see what was happening. Two tall men stood in the street. Both were dressed in long black cloaks that
were lifted by sheaths poking past their legs. On their shirts were insignias intricately wrought with silver
thread. Hoods shaded their faces, and their hands were covered by gloves. Their backs were oddly
humped, as though their clothes were stuffed with padding.
Eragon shifted slightly to get a better view. One of the strangers stiffened and grunted peculiarly to his
companion. They both swiveled around and sank into crouches. Eragon’s breath caught. Mortal fear
clenched him. His eyes locked onto their hidden faces, and a stifling power fell over his mind, keeping
him in place. He struggled against it and screamed to himself,Move! His legs swayed, but to no avail. The
strangers stalked toward him with a smooth, noiseless gait. He knew they could see his face now. They
were almost to the corner, hands grasping at swords…
“Eragon!” He jerked as his name was called. The strangers froze in place and hissed. Brom hurried
toward him from the side, head bare and staff in hand. The strangers were blocked from the old man’s
view. Eragon tried to warn him, but his tongue and arms would not stir. “Eragon!” cried Brom again. The
strangers gave Eragon one last look, then slipped away between the houses.
Eragon collapsed to the ground, shivering. Sweat beaded on his forehead and made his palms sticky.
The old man offered Eragon a hand and pulled him up with a strong arm. “You look sick; is all well?”
Eragon gulped and nodded mutely. His eyes flickered around, searching for anything unusual. “I just got
dizzy all of a sudden… it’s passed. It was very odd—I don’t know why it happened.”
“You’ll recover,” said Brom, “but perhaps it would be better if you went home.”
Yes, I have to get home! Have to get there before they do.“I think you’re right. Maybe I’m getting ill.”

“Then home is the best place for you. It’s a long walk, but I’m sure you will feel better by the time you
arrive. Let me escort you to the road.” Eragon did not protest as Brom took his arm and led him away at
a quick pace. Brom’s staff crunched in the snow as they passed the houses.
“Why were you looking for me?”
Brom shrugged. “Simple curiosity. I learned you were in town and wondered if you had remembered the
name of that trader.”
Trader? What’s he talking about?Eragon stared blankly; his confusion caught the attention of Brom’s
probing eyes. “No,” he said, and then amended himself, “I’m afraid I still don’t remember.”
Brom sighed gruffly, as if something had been confirmed, and rubbed his eagle nose. “Well, then… if
you do, come tell me. I am most interested in this trader who pretends to know so much about dragons.”
Eragon nodded with a distracted air. They walked in silence to the road, then Brom said, “Hasten home.
I don’t think it would be a good idea to tarry on the way.” He offered a gnarled hand.
Eragon shook it, but as he let go something in Brom’s hand caught on his mitt and pulled it off. It fell to
the ground. The old man picked it up. “Clumsy of me,” he apologized, and handed it back. As Eragon
took the mitt, Brom’s strong fingers wrapped around his wrist and twisted sharply. His palm briefly faced
upward, revealing the silvery mark. Brom’s eyes glinted, but he let Eragon yank his hand back and jam it
into the mitt.
“Goodbye,” Eragon forced out, perturbed, and hurried down the road. Behind him he heard Brom
whistling a merry tune.
FLIGHT OFDESTINY
Eragon’s mind churned as he sped on his way. He ran as fast as he could, refusing to stop even when his
breath came in great gasps. As he pounded down the cold road, he cast out with his mind for Saphira,
but she was too far away for him to contact. He thought about what to say to Garrow. There was no
choice now; he would have to reveal Saphira.
He arrived home, panting for air and heart pounding. Garrow stood by the barn with the horses. Eragon
hesitated. Should I talk to him now? He won’t believe me unless Saphira is here—I’d better find her first.
He slipped around the farm and into the forest.Saphira! he shouted with his thoughts.
I come,was the dim reply. Through the words he sensed her alarm. He waited impatiently, though it was
not long before the sound of her wings filled the air. She landed amid a gout of smoke.What happened?
she queried.
He touched her shoulder and closed his eyes. Calming his mind, he quickly told her what had occurred.
When he mentioned the strangers, Saphira recoiled. She reared and roared deafeningly, then whipped
her tail over his head. He scrambled back in surprise, ducking as her tail hit a snowdrift. Bloodlust and
fear emanated from her in great sickening waves.Fire! Enemies! Death! Murderers!
What’s wrong?He put all of his strength into the words, but an iron wall surrounded her mind, shielding
her thoughts. She let out another roar and gouged the earth with her claws, tearing the frozen ground.
Stop it! Garrow will hear!
Oaths betrayed, souls killed, eggs shattered! Blood everywhere. Murderers!

Frantic, he blocked out Saphira’s emotions and watched her tail. When it flicked past him, he dashed to
her side and grabbed a spike on her back. Clutching it, he pulled himself into the small hollow at the base
of her neck and held on tightly as she reared again. “Enough, Saphira!” he bellowed. Her stream of
thoughts ceased abruptly. He ran a hand over her scales. “Everything’s going to be all right.” She
crouched and her wings rushed upward. They hung there for an instant, then drove down as she flung
herself into the sky.
Eragon yelled as the ground dropped away and they rose above the trees. Turbulence buffeted him,
snatching the breath out of his mouth. Saphira ignored his terror and banked toward the Spine.
Underneath, he glimpsed the farm and the Anora River. His stomach convulsed. He tightened his arms
around Saphira’s neck and concentrated on the scales in front of his nose, trying not to vomit as she
continued to climb. When she leveled off, he gained the courage to glance around.
The air was so cold that frost accumulated on his eyelashes. They had reached the mountains faster than
he thought possible. From the air, the peaks looked like giant razor-sharp teeth waiting to slash them to
ribbons. Saphira wobbled unexpectedly, and Eragon heaved over her side. He wiped his lips, tasting bile,
and buried his head against her neck.
We have to go back,he pleaded.The strangers are coming to the farm. Garrow has to be warned. Turn
around! There was no answer. He reached for her mind, but was blocked by a barrier of roiling fear and
anger. Determined to make her turn around, he grimly wormed into her mental armor. He pushed at its
weak places, undermined the stronger sections, and fought to make her listen, but to no avail.
Soon mountains surrounded them, forming tremendous white walls broken by granite cliffs. Blue glaciers
sat between the summits like frozen rivers. Long valleys and ravines opened beneath them. He heard the
dismayed screech of birds far below as Saphira soared into view. He saw a herd of woolly goats
bounding from ledge to ledge on a rocky bluff.
Eragon was battered by swirling gusts from Saphira’s wings, and whenever she moved her neck, he was
tossed from side to side. She seemed tireless. He was afraid she was going to fly through the night.
Finally, as darkness fell, she tilted into a shallow dive.
He looked ahead and saw that they were headed for a small clearing in a valley. Saphira spiraled down,
leisurely drifting over the treetops. She pulled back as the ground neared, filled her wings with air, and
landed on her rear legs. Her powerful muscles rippled as they absorbed the shock of impact. She
dropped to all fours and skipped a step to keep her balance. Eragon slid off without waiting for her to
fold her wings.
As he struck the ground, his knees buckled, and his cheek slammed against the snow. He gasped as
excruciating pain seared through his legs, sending tears to his eyes. His muscles, cramped from clenching
for so long, shook violently. He rolled onto his back, shivering, and stretched his limbs as best he could.
Then he forced himself to look down. Two large blots darkened his wool pants on the insides of his
thighs. He touched the fabric. It was wet. Alarmed, he peeled off the pants and grimaced. The insides of
his legs were raw and bloody. The skin was gone, rubbed off by Saphira’s hard scales. He gingerly felt
the abrasions and winced. Cold bit into him as he pulled the pants back on, and he cried out as they
scraped against the sensitive wounds. He tried to stand, but his legs would not support him.
The deepening night obscured his surroundings; the shaded mountains were unfamiliar. I’m in the Spine,
I don’t know where, during the middle of winter, with a crazed dragon, unable to walk or find shelter.
Night is falling. I have to get back to the farm tomorrow. And the only way to do that is to fly, which I

can’t endure anymore.He took a deep breath.Oh, I wish Saphira could breathe fire. He turned his head
and saw her next to him, crouched low to the ground. He put a hand on her side and found it trembling.
The barrier in her mind was gone. Without it, her fear scorched through him. He clamped down on it and
slowly soothed her with gentle images.Why do the strangers frighten you?
Murderers, she hissed.
Garrow is in danger and you kidnap me on this ridiculous journey! Are you unable to protect me?She
growled deeply and snapped her jaws.Ah, but if you think you can, why run?
Death is a poison.
He leaned on one elbow and stifled his frustration.Saphira, look where we are! The sun is down, and
your flight has stripped my legs as easily as I would scale a fish. Is that what you wanted?
No.
Then why did you do it?he demanded. Through his link with Saphira, he felt her regret for his pain, but
not for her actions. She looked away and refused to answer. The icy temperature deadened Eragon’s
legs; although it lessened the pain, he knew that his condition was not good. He changed tack.I’m going
to freeze unless you make me a shelter or hollow so I can stay warm. Even a pile of pine needles and
branches would do.
She seemed relieved that he had stopped interrogating her.There is no need. I will curl around you and
cover you with my wings—the fire inside me will stay the cold.
Eragon let his head thump back on the ground.Fine, but scrape the snow off the ground. It’ll be more
comfortable. In answer, Saphira razed a drift with her tail, clearing it with one powerful stroke. She
swept over the site again to remove the last few inches of hardened snow. He eyed the exposed dirt with
distaste.I can’t walk over there. You’ll have to help me to it. Her head, larger than his torso, swung over
him and came to rest by his side. He stared at her large, sapphire-colored eyes and wrapped his hands
around one of her ivory spikes. She lifted her head and slowly dragged him to the bare spot.Gently,
gently. Stars danced in his eyes as he slid over a rock, but he managed to hold on. After he let go,
Saphira rolled on her side, exposing her warm belly. He huddled against the smooth scales of her
underside. Her right wing extended over him and enclosed him in complete darkness, forming a living
tent. Almost immediately the air began to lose its frigidity.
He pulled his arms inside his coat and tied the empty sleeves around his neck. For the first time he
noticed that hunger gnawed at his stomach. But it did not distract him from his main worry: Could he get
back to the farm before the strangers did? And if not, what would happen?Even if I can force myself to
ride Saphira again, it’ll be at least mid-afternoon before we get back. The strangers could be there long
before that. He closed his eyes and felt a single tear slide down his face.What have I done?
THEDOOM OFINNOCENCE
When Eragon opened his eyes in the morning, he thought the sky had fallen. An unbroken plane of blue
stretched over his head and slanted to the ground. Still half asleep, he reached out tentatively and felt a
thin membrane under his fingers. It took him a long minute to realize what he was staring at. He bent his
neck slightly and glared at the scaly haunch his head rested on. Slowly he pushed his legs out from his
fetal curl, scabs cracking. The pain had subsided some from yesterday, but he shrank from the thought of
walking. Burning hunger reminded him of his missed meals. He summoned the energy to move and

pounded weakly on Saphira’s side. “Hey! Wake up!” he yelled.
She stirred and lifted her wing to admit a torrent of sunshine. He squinted as the snow momentarily
blinded him. Beside him Saphira stretched like a cat and yawned, flashing rows of white teeth. When
Eragon’s eyes adjusted, he examined where they were. Imposing and unfamiliar mountains surrounded
them, casting deep shadows on the clearing. Off to one side, he saw a trail cut through the snow and into
the forest, where he could hear the muffled gurgling of a creek.
Groaning, he stood and swayed, then stiffly hobbled to a tree. He grabbed one of its branches and threw
his weight against it. It held, then broke with a loud crack. He ripped off the twigs, fit one end of the
branch under his arm, and planted the other firmly in the ground. With the help of his improvised crutch,
he limped to the iced-over creek. He broke through the hard shell and cupped the clear, bitter water.
Sated, he returned to the clearing. As he emerged from the trees, he finally recognized the mountains and
the lay of the land.
This was where, amid deafening sound, Saphira’s egg had first appeared. He sagged against a rough
trunk. There could be no mistake, for now he saw the gray trees that had been stripped of their needles
in the explosion.How did Saphira know where this was? She was still in the egg. My memories must
have given her enough information to find it. He shook his head in silent astonishment.
Saphira was waiting patiently for him.Will you take me home? he asked her. She cocked her head.I
know you don’t want to, but you must. Both of us carry an obligation to Garrow. He has cared for me
and, through me, you. Would you ignore that debt? What will be said of us in years to come if we don’t
return—that we hid like cowards while my uncle was in danger? I can hear it now, the story of the Rider
and his craven dragon! If there will be a fight, let’s face it and not shy away. You are a dragon! Even a
Shade would run from you! Yet you crouch in the mountains like a frightened rabbit.
Eragon meant to anger her, and he succeeded. A growl rippled in her throat as her head jabbed within a
few inches of his face. She bared her fangs and glared at him, smoke trailing from her nostrils. He hoped
that he had not gone too far. Her thoughts reached him, red with anger.Blood will meet blood. I will fight.
Our wyrds—our fates—bind us, but try me not. I will take you because of debt owed, but into
foolishness we fly.
“Foolishness or not,” he said into the air, “there is no choice—we must go.” He ripped his shirt in half
and stuffed a piece into each side of his pants. Gingerly, he hoisted himself onto Saphira and took a tight
hold on her neck.This time, he told her,fly lower and faster. Time is of the essence.
Don’t let go,she cautioned, then surged into the sky. They rose above the forest and leveled out
immediately, barely staying above the branches. Eragon’s stomach lurched; he was glad it was empty.
Faster, faster,he urged. She said nothing, but the beat of her wings increased. He screwed his eyes shut
and hunched his shoulders. He had hoped that the extra padding of his shirt would protect him, but every
movement sent pangs through his legs. Soon lines of hot blood trickled down his calves. Concern
emanated from Saphira. She went even faster now, her wings straining. The land sped past, as if it were
being pulled out from under them. Eragon imagined that to someone on the ground, they were just a blur.
By early afternoon, Palancar Valley lay before them. Clouds obscured his vision to the south; Carvahall
was to the north. Saphira glided down while Eragon searched for the farm. When he spotted it, fear
jolted him. A black plume with orange flames dancing at its base rose from the farm.
Saphira!He pointed.Get me down there. Now!

Page 47

She locked her wings and tilted into a steep dive, hurtling groundward at a frightening rate. Then she
altered her dive slightly so they sped toward the forest. He yelled over the screaming air, “Land in the
fields!” He held on tighter as they plummeted. Saphira waited until they were only a hundred feet off the
ground before driving her wings downward in several powerful strokes. She landed heavily, breaking his
grip. He crashed to the ground, then staggered upright, gasping for breath.
The house had been blasted apart. Timbers and boards that had been walls and roof were strewn across
a wide area. The wood was pulverized, as if a giant hammer had smashed it. Sooty shingles lay
everywhere. A few twisted metal plates were all that remained of the stove. The snow was perforated
with smashed white crockery and chunks of bricks from the chimney. Thick, oily smoke billowed from
the barn, which burned fiercely. The farm animals were gone, either killed or frightened away.
“Uncle!” Eragon ran to the wreckage, hunting through the destroyed rooms for Garrow. There was no
sign of him. “Uncle!” Eragon cried again. Saphira walked around the house and came to his side.
Sorrow breeds here,she said.
“This wouldn’t have happened if you hadn’t run away with me!”
You would not be alive if we had stayed.
“Look at this!” he screamed. “We could’ve warned Garrow! It’s your fault he didn’t get away!” He
slammed his fist against a pole, splitting the skin on his knuckles. Blood dripped down his fingers as he
stalked out of the house. He stumbled to the path that led to the road and bent down to examine the
snow. Several tracks were before him, but his vision was blurry and he could barely see.Am I going
blind? he wondered. With a shaking hand, he touched his cheeks and found them wet.
A shadow fell on him as Saphira loomed overhead, sheltering him with her wings.Take comfort; all may
not be lost. He looked up at her, searching for hope.Examine the trail; my eyes see only two sets of
prints. Garrow could not have been taken from here.
He focused on the trampled snow. The faint imprints of two pairs of leather boots headed toward the
house. On top of those were traces of the same two sets of boots leaving. And whoever had made the
departing tracks had been carrying the same weight as when they arrived.You’re right, Garrow has to be
here! He leapt to his feet and hurried back to the house.
I will search around the buildings and in the forest,said Saphira.
Eragon scrambled into the remains of the kitchen and frantically started digging through a pile of rubble.
Pieces of debris that he could not have moved normally now seemed to shift on their own accord. A
cupboard, mostly intact, stymied him for a second, then he heaved and sent it flying. As he pulled on a
board, something rattled behind him. He spun around, ready for an attack.
A hand extended from under a section of collapsed roof. It moved weakly, and he grasped it with a cry.
“Uncle, can you hear me?” There was no response. Eragon tore at pieces of wood, heedless of the
splinters that pierced his hands. He quickly exposed an arm and shoulder, but was barred by a heavy
beam. He threw his shoulder at it and shoved with every fiber of his being, but it defied his efforts.
“Saphira! I need you!”
She came immediately. Wood cracked under her feet as she crawled over the ruined walls. Without a

Page 48

word she nosed past him and set her side against the beam. Her claws sank into what was left of the
floor; her muscles strained. With a grating sound, the beam lifted, and Eragon rushed under it. Garrow lay
on his stomach, his clothes mostly torn off. Eragon pulled him out of the rubble. As soon as they were
clear, Saphira released the beam, leaving it to crash to the floor.
Eragon dragged Garrow out of the destroyed house and eased him to the ground. Dismayed, he touched
his uncle gently. His skin was gray, lifeless, and dry, as if a fever had burned off any sweat. His lip was
split, and there was a long scrape on his cheekbone, but that was not the worst. Deep, ragged burns
covered most of his body. They were chalky white and oozed clear liquid. A cloying, sickening smell
hung over him—the odor of rotting fruit. His breath came in short jerks, each one sounding like a death
rattle.
Murderers,hissed Saphira.
Don’t say that. He can still be saved! We have to get him to Gertrude. I can’t carry him to Carvahall,
though.
Saphira presented an image of Garrow hanging under her while she flew.
Can you lift both of us?
I must.
Eragon dug through the rubble until he found a board and leather thongs. He had Saphira pierce a hole
with a claw at each of the board’s corners, then he looped a piece of leather through each hole and tied
them to her forelegs. After checking to make sure the knots were secure, he rolled Garrow onto the
board and lashed him down. As he did, a scrap of black cloth fell from his uncle’s hand. It matched the
strangers’ clothing. He angrily stuffed it in a pocket, mounted Saphira, and closed his eyes as his body
settled into a steady throb of pain.Now!
She leapt up, hind legs digging into the ground. Her wings clawed at the air as she slowly climbed.
Tendons strained and popped as she battled gravity. For a long, painful second, nothing happened, but
then she lunged forward powerfully and they rose higher. Once they were over the forest, Eragon told
her,Follow the road. It’ll give you enough room if you have to land.
I might be seen.
It doesn’t matter anymore!She argued no further as she veered to the road and headed for Carvahall.
Garrow swung wildly underneath them; only the slender leather cords kept him from falling.
The extra weight slowed Saphira. Before long her head sagged, and there was froth at her mouth. She
struggled to continue, yet they were almost a league from Carvahall when she locked her wings and sank
toward the road.
Her hind feet touched with a shower of snow. Eragon tumbled off her, landing heavily on his side to
avoid hurting his legs. He struggled to his feet and worked to untie the leather from Saphira’s legs. Her
thick panting filled the air.Find a safe place to rest, he said.I don’t know how long I’ll be gone, so you’re
going to have to take care of yourself for a while.
I will wait,she said.

Page 49

He gritted his teeth and began to drag Garrow down the road. The first few steps sent an explosion of
agony through him. “I can’t do this!” he howled at the sky, then took a few more steps. His mouth
locked into a snarl. He stared at the ground between his feet as he forced himself to hold a steady pace.
It was a fight against his unruly body—a fight he refused to lose. The minutes crawled by at an
excruciating rate. Each yard he covered seemed many times that. With desperation he wondered if
Carvahall still existed or if the strangers had burnt it down, too. After a time, through a haze of pain, he
heard shouting and looked up.
Brom was running toward him—eyes large, hair awry, and one side of his head caked with dried blood.
He waved his arms wildly before dropping his staff and grabbing Eragon’s shoulders, saying something in
a loud voice. Eragon blinked uncomprehendingly. Without warning, the ground rushed up to meet him.
He tasted blood, then blacked out.
DEATHWATCH
Dreams roiled in Eragon’s mind, breeding and living by their own laws.He watched as a group of people
on proud horses approached a lonely river. Many had silver hair and carried tall lances. A strange, fair
ship waited for them, shining under a bright moon. The figures slowly boarded the vessel; two of them,
taller than the rest, walked arm in arm. Their faces were obscured by cowls, but he could tell that one
was a woman. They stood on the deck of the ship and faced the shore. A man stood alone on the pebble
beach, the only one who had not boarded the ship. He threw back his head and let out a long, aching
cry. As it faded, the ship glided down the river, without a breeze or oars, out into the flat, empty land.
The vision clouded, but just before it disappeared, Eragon glimpsed two dragons in the sky.
Eragon was first aware of the creaking: back and forth, back and forth. The persistent sound made him
open his eyes and stare at the underside of a thatched roof. A rough blanket was draped over him,
concealing his nakedness. Someone had bandaged his legs and tied a clean rag around his knuckles.
He was in a single-room hut. A mortar and pestle sat on a table with bowls and plants. Rows of dried
herbs hung from the walls and suffused the air with strong, earthy aromas. Flames writhed inside a
fireplace, before which sat a rotund woman in a wicker rocking chair—the town healer, Gertrude. Her
head lolled, eyes closed. A pair of knitting needles and a ball of wool thread rested in her lap.
Though Eragon felt drained of willpower, he made himself sit up. That helped to clear his mind. He sifted
through his memories of the last two days. His first thought was of Garrow, and his second was of
Saphira.I hope she’s in a safe place. He tried to contact her but could not. Wherever she was, it was far
from Carvahall.At least Brom got me to Carvahall. I wonder what happened to him? There was all that
blood.
Gertrude stirred and opened her sparkling eyes. “Oh,” she said. “You’re awake. Good!” Her voice was
rich and warm. “How do you feel?”
“Well enough. Where’s Garrow?”
Gertrude dragged the chair close to the bed. “Over at Horst’s. There wasn’t enough room to keep both
of you here. And let me tell you, it’s kept me on my toes, having to run back and forth, checking to see if
the two of you were all right.”
Eragon swallowed his worries and asked, “How is he?”

Page 50

There was a long delay as she examined her hands. “Not good. He has a fever that refuses to break,
and his injuries aren’t healing.”
“I have to see him.” He tried to get up.
“Not until you eat,” she said sharply, pushing him down. “I didn’t spend all this time sitting by your side
so you can get back up and hurt yourself. Half the skin on your legs was torn off, and your fever broke
only last night. Don’t worry yourself about Garrow. He’ll be fine. He’s a tough man.” Gertrude hung a
kettle over the fire, then began chopping parsnips for soup.
“How long have I been here?”
“Two full days.”
Two days!That meant his last meal had been four mornings ago! Just thinking about it made Eragon feel
weak.Saphira’s been on her own this entire time; I hope she’s all right.
“The whole town wants to know what happened. They sent men down to your farm and found it
destroyed.” Eragon nodded; he had expected that. “Your barn was burned down… Is that how Garrow
was injured?”
“I… I don’t know,” said Eragon. “I wasn’t there when it happened.”
“Well, no matter. I’m sure it’ll all get untangled.” Gertrude resumed knitting while the soup cooked.
“That’s quite a scar on your palm.”
He reflexively clenched his hand. “Yes.”
“How did you get it?”
Several possible answers came to mind. He chose the simplest one. “I’ve had it ever since I can
remember. I never asked Garrow where it came from.”
“Mmm.” The silence remained unbroken until the soup reached a rolling boil. Gertrude poured it in a
bowl and handed it to Eragon with a spoon. He accepted it gratefully and took a cautious sip. It was
delicious.
When he finished, he asked, “Can I visit Garrow now?”
Gertrude sighed. “You’re a determined one, aren’t you? Well, if you really want to, I won’t stop you.
Put on your clothes and we’ll go.”
She turned her back as he struggled into his pants, wincing as they dragged over the bandages, and then
slipped on his shirt. Gertrude helped him stand. His legs were weak, but they did not pain him like
before.
“Take a few steps,” she commanded, then dryly observed, “At least you won’t have to crawl there.”
Outside, a blustery wind blew smoke from the adjacent buildings into their faces. Storm clouds hid the
Spine and covered the valley while a curtain of snow advanced toward the village, obscuring the foothills.
Eragon leaned heavily on Gertrude as they made their way through Carvahall.

Horst had built his two-story house on a hill so he could enjoy a view of the mountains. He had lavished
all of his skill on it. The shale roof shadowed a railed balcony that extended from a tall window on the
second floor. Each water spout was a snarling gargoyle, and every window and door was framed by
carvings of serpents, harts, ravens, and knotted vines.
The door was opened by Elain, Horst’s wife, a small, willowy woman with refined features and silky
blond hair pinned into a bun. Her dress was demure and neat, and her movements graceful. “Please,
come in,” she said softly. They stepped over the threshold into a large well-lit room. A staircase with a
polished balustrade curved down to the floor. The walls were the color of honey. Elain gave Eragon a
sad smile, but addressed Gertrude. “I was just about to send for you. He isn’t doing well. You should
see him right away.”
“Elain, you’ll have to help Eragon up the stairs,” Gertrude said, then hurried up them two at a time.
“It’s okay, I can do it myself.”
“Are you sure?” asked Elain. He nodded, but she looked doubtful. “Well… as soon as you’re done
come visit me in the kitchen. I have a fresh-baked pie you might enjoy.” As soon as she left, he sagged
against the wall, welcoming the support. Then he started up the stairs, one painful step at a time. When he
reached the top, he looked down a long hallway dotted with doors. The last one was open slightly.
Taking a breath, he lurched toward it.
Katrina stood by a fireplace, boiling rags. She looked up, murmured a condolence, and then returned to
her work. Gertrude stood beside her, grinding herbs for a poultice. A bucket by her feet held snow
melting into ice water.
Garrow lay on a bed piled high with blankets. Sweat covered his brow, and his eyeballs flickered blindly
under their lids. The skin on his face was shrunken like a cadaver’s. He was still, save for subtle tremors
from his shallow breathing. Eragon touched his uncle’s forehead with a feeling of unreality. It burned
against his hand. He apprehensively lifted the edge of the blankets and saw that Garrow’s many wounds
were bound with strips of cloth. Where the bandages were being changed, the burns were exposed to
the air. They had not begun to heal. Eragon looked at Gertrude with hopeless eyes. “Can’t you do
anything about these?”
She pressed a rag into the bucket of ice water, then draped the cool cloth over Garrow’s head. “I’ve
tried everything: salves, poultices, tinctures, but nothing works. If the wounds closed, he would have a
better chance. Still, things may turn for the better. He’s hardy and strong.”
Eragon moved to a corner and sank to the floor.This isn’t the way things are supposed to be! Silence
swallowed his thoughts. He stared blankly at the bed. After a while he noticed Katrina kneeling beside
him. She put an arm around him. When he did not respond, she diffidently left.
Sometime later the door opened and Horst came in. He talked to Gertrude in a low voice, then
approached Eragon. “Come on. You need to get out of here.” Before Eragon could protest, Horst
dragged him to his feet and shepherded him out the door.
“I want to stay,” he complained.
“You need a break and fresh air. Don’t worry, you can go back soon enough,” consoled Horst.

Eragon grudgingly let the smith help him downstairs into the kitchen. Heady smells from half a dozen
dishes—rich with spices and herbs—filled the air. Albriech and Baldor were there, talking with their
mother as she kneaded bread. The brothers fell silent as they saw Eragon, but he had heard enough to
know that they were discussing Garrow.
“Here, sit down,” said Horst, offering a chair.
Eragon sank into it gratefully. “Thank you.” His hands were shaking slightly, so he clasped them in his
lap. A plate, piled high with food, was set before him.
“You don’t have to eat,” said Elain, “but it’s there if you want.” She returned to her cooking as he
picked up a fork. He could barely swallow a few bites.
“How do you feel?” asked Horst.
“Terrible.”
The smith waited a moment. “I know this isn’t the best time, but we need to know… what happened?”
“I don’t really remember.”
“Eragon,” said Horst, leaning forward, “I was one of the people who went out to your farm. Your house
didn’t just fall apart—something tore it to pieces. Surrounding it were tracks of a gigantic beast I’ve
never seen nor heard of before. Others saw them too. Now, if there’s a Shade or a monster roaming
around, we have to know. You’re the only one who can tell us.”
Eragon knew he had to lie. “When I left Carvahall…,” he counted up the time, “four days ago, there
were… strangers in town asking about a stone like the one I found.” He gestured at Horst. “You talked
to me about them, and because of that, I hurried home.” All eyes were upon him. He licked his lips.
“Nothing… nothing happened that night. The next morning I finished my chores and went walking in the
forest. Before long I heard an explosion and saw smoke above the trees. I rushed back as fast as I
could, but whoever did it was already gone. I dug through the wreckage and… found Garrow.”
“So then you put him on the plank and dragged him back?” asked Albriech.
“Yes,” said Eragon, “but before I left, I looked at the path to the road. There were two pairs of tracks
on it, both of them men’s.” He dug in his pocket and pulled out the scrap of black fabric. “This was
clenched in Garrow’s hand. I think it matches what those strangers were wearing.” He set it on the table.
“It does,” said Horst. He looked both thoughtful and angry. “And what of your legs? How were they
injured?”
“I’m not sure,” said Eragon, shaking his head. “I think it happened when I dug Garrow out, but I don’t
know. It wasn’t until the blood started dripping down my legs that I noticed it.”
“That’s horrible!” exclaimed Elain.
“We should pursue those men,” stated Albriech hotly. “They can’t get away with this! With a pair of
horses we could catch them tomorrow and bring them back here.”
“Put that foolishness out of your head,” said Horst. “They could probably pick you up like a baby and

throw you in a tree. Remember what happened to the house? We don’t want to get in the way of those
people. Besides, they have what they want now.” He looked at Eragon. “They did take the stone, didn’t
they?”
“It wasn’t in the house.”
“Then there’s no reason for them to return now that they have it.” He gave Eragon a piercing look. “You
didn’t mention anything about those strange tracks. Do you know where they came from?”
Eragon shook his head. “I didn’t see them.”
Baldor abruptly spoke. “I don’t like this. Too much of this rings of wizardry. Who are those men? Are
they Shades? Why did they want the stone, and how could they have destroyed the house except with
dark powers? You may be right, Father, the stone might be all they wanted, but I think we will see them
again.”
Silence followed his words.
Something had been overlooked, though Eragon was not sure what. Then it struck him. With a sinking
heart, he voiced his suspicion. “Roran doesn’t know, does he?”How could I have forgotten him?
Horst shook his head. “He and Dempton left a little while after you. Unless they ran into some difficulty
on the road, they’ve been in Therinsford for a couple of days now. We were going to send a message,
but the weather was too cold yesterday and the day before.”
“Baldor and I were about to leave when you woke up,” offered Albriech.
Horst ran a hand through his beard. “Go on, both of you. I’ll help you saddle the horses.”
Baldor turned to Eragon. “I’ll break it to him gently,” he promised, then followed Horst and Albriech out
of the kitchen.
Eragon remained at the table, his eyes focused on a knot in the wood. Every excruciating detail was
clear to him: the twisting grain, an asymmetrical bump, three little ridges with a fleck of color. The knot
was filled with endless detail; the closer he looked, the more he saw. He searched for answers in it, but if
there were any, they eluded him.
A faint call broke through his pounding thoughts. It sounded like yelling from outside. He ignored it.Let
someone else deal with it. Several minutes later he heard it again, louder than before. Angrily, he blocked
it out.Why can’t they be quiet? Garrow’s resting. He glanced at Elain, but she did not seem to be
bothered by the noise.
ERAGON!The roar was so strong he almost fell out of the chair. He peered around in alarm, but
nothing had changed. He suddenly realized that the shouts had been inside his head.
Saphira?he asked anxiously.
There was a pause.Yes, stone ears.
Relief seeped into him.Where are you?

She sent him an image of a small clump of trees.I tried to contact you many times, but you were beyond
reach.
I was sick… but I’m better now. Why couldn’t I sense you earlier?
After two nights of waiting, hunger bested me. I had to hunt.
Did you catch anything?
A young buck. He was wise enough to guard against the predators of land, but not those of sky. When I
first caught him in my jaws, he kicked vigorously and tried to escape. I was stronger, though, and when
defeat became unavoidable, he gave up and died. Does Garrow also fight the inevitable?
I don’t know.He told her the particulars, then said,It’ll be a long time, if ever, before we can go home. I
won’t be able to see you for at least a couple of days. You might as well make yourself comfortable.
Unhappily, she said,I will do as you say. But do not take too long.
They parted reluctantly. He looked out a window and was surprised to see that the sun had set. Feeling
very tired, he limped to Elain, who was wrapping meat pies with oilcloth. “I’m going back to Gertrude’s
house to sleep,” he said.
She finished with the packages and asked, “Why don’t you stay with us? You’ll be closer to your uncle,
and Gertrude can have her bed back.”
“Do you have enough room?” he asked, wavering.
“Of course.” She wiped her hands. “Come with me; I’ll get everything ready.” She escorted him upstairs
to an empty room. He sat on the edge of the bed. “Do you need anything else?” she asked. He shook his
head. “In that case, I’ll be downstairs. Call me if you need help.” He listened as she descended the stairs.
Then he opened the door and slipped down the hallway to Garrow’s room. Gertrude gave him a small
smile over her darting knitting needles.
“How is he?” whispered Eragon.
Her voice rasped with fatigue. “He’s weak, but the fever’s gone down a little and some of the burns
look better. We’ll have to wait and see, but this could mean he’ll recover.”
That lightened Eragon’s mood, and he returned to his room. The darkness seemed unfriendly as he
huddled under the blankets. Eventually he fell asleep, healing the wounds his body and soul had suffered.
THEMADNESS OFLIFE
It was dark when Eragon jolted upright in bed, breathing hard. The room was chilly; goose bumps
formed on his arms and shoulders. It was a few hours before dawn—the time when nothing moves and
life waits for the first warm touches of sunlight.
His heart pounded as a terrible premonition gripped him. It felt like a shroud lay over the world, and its
darkest corner was over his room. He quietly got out of bed and dressed. With apprehension he hurried
down the hallway. Alarm shot through him when he saw the door to Garrow’s room open and people
clustered inside.

Page 55

Garrow lay peacefully on the bed. He was dressed in clean clothes, his hair had been combed back, and
his face was calm. He might have been sleeping if not for the silver amulet clasped around his neck and
the sprig of dried hemlock on his chest, the last gifts from the living to the dead.
Katrina stood next to the bed, face pale and eyes downcast. He heard her whisper, “I had hoped to call
himFather one day…”
Call him Father,he thought bitterly,a right even I don’t have. He felt like a ghost, drained of all vitality.
Everything was insubstantial except for Garrow’s face. Tears flooded Eragon’s cheeks. He stood there,
shoulders shaking, but did not cry out. Mother, aunt, uncle—he had lost them all. The weight of his grief
was crushing, a monstrous force that left him tottering. Someone led him back to his room, uttering
consolations.
He fell on the bed, wrapped his arms around his head, and sobbed convulsively. He felt Saphira contact
him, but he pushed her aside and let himself be swept away by sorrow. He could not accept that Garrow
was gone. If he did, what was left to believe in? Only a merciless, uncaring world that snuffed lives like
candles before a wind. Frustrated and terrified, he turned his tear-dampened face toward the heavens
and shouted, “What god would do this? Show yourself!” He heard people running to his room, but no
answer came from above. “He didn’t deserve this!”
Comforting hands touched him, and he was aware of Elain sitting next to him. She held him as he cried,
and eventually, exhausted, he slipped unwillingly into sleep.
A RIDER’SBLADE
Anguish enveloped Eragon as he awoke. Though he kept his eyes closed, they could not stop a fresh
flow of tears. He searched for some idea or hope to help him keep his sanity.I can’t live with this, he
moaned.
Then don’t.Saphira’s words reverberated in his head.
How? Garrow is gone forever! And in time, I must meet the same fate. Love, family,
accomplishments—they are all torn away, leaving nothing. What is the worth of anything we do?
The worth is in the act. Your worth halts when you surrender the will to change and experience life. But
options are before you; choose one and dedicate yourself to it. The deeds will give you new hope and
purpose.
But what can I do?
The only true guide is your heart. Nothing less than its supreme desire can help you.
She left him to ponder her statements. Eragon examined his emotions. It surprised him that, more than
grief, he found a searing anger.What do you want me to do… pursue the strangers?
Yes.
Her frank answer confused him. He took a deep, trembling breath.Why?
Remember what you said in the Spine? How you reminded me of my duty as dragon, and I returned

Page 56

with you despite the urging of my instinct? So, too, must you control yourself. I thought long and deep the
past few days, and I realized what it means to be dragon and Rider: It is our destiny to attempt the
impossible, to accomplish great deeds regardless of fear. It is our responsibility to the future.
I don’t care what you say; those aren’t reasons to leave!cried Eragon.
Then here are others. My tracks have been seen, and people are alert to my presence. Eventually I will
be exposed. Besides, there is nothing here for you. No farm, no family, and—
Roran’s not dead!he said vehemently.
But if you stay, you’ll have to explain what really happened. He has a right to know how and why his
father died. What might he do once he knows of me?
Saphira’s arguments whirled around in Eragon’s head, but he shrank from the idea of forsaking Palancar
Valley; it was his home. Yet the thought of enacting vengeance on the strangers was fiercely comforting.
Am I strong enough for this?
You have me.
Doubt besieged him. It would be such a wild, desperate thing to do. Contempt for his indecision rose,
and a harsh smile danced on his lips. Saphira was right. Nothing mattered anymore except the act itself.
The doing is the thing. And what would give him more satisfaction than hunting down the strangers? A
terrible energy and strength began to grow in him. It grabbed his emotions and forged them into a solid
bar of anger with one word stamped on it: revenge. His head pounded as he said with conviction,I will do
it.
He severed the contact with Saphira and rolled out of bed, his body tense like a coiled spring. It was still
early morning; he had only slept a few hours.Nothing is more dangerous than an enemy with nothing to
lose, he thought.Which is what I have become.
Yesterday he had had difficulty walking upright, but now he moved confidently, held in place by his iron
will. The pain his body sent him was defied and ignored.
As he crept out of the house, he heard the murmur of two people talking. Curious, he stopped and
listened. Elain was saying in her gentle voice, “…place to stay. We have room.” Horst answered
inaudibly in his bass rumble. “Yes, the poor boy,” replied Elain.
This time Eragon could hear Horst’s response. “Maybe…” There was a long pause. “I’ve been thinking
about what Eragon said, and I’m not sure he told us everything.”
“What do you mean?” asked Elain. There was concern in her voice.
“When we started for their farm, the road was scraped smooth by the board he dragged Garrow on.
Then we reached a place where the snow was all trampled and churned up. His footprints and signs of
the board stopped there, but we also saw the same giant tracks from the farm. And what about his legs?
I can’t believe he didn’t notice losing that much skin. I didn’t want to push him for answers earlier, but
now I think I will.”
“Maybe what he saw scared him so much that he doesn’t want to talk about it,” suggested Elain. “You
saw how distraught he was.”

Page 57

“That still doesn’t explain how he managed to get Garrow nearly all the way here without leaving any
tracks.”
Saphira was right,thought Eragon.It’s time to leave. Too many questions from too many people. Sooner
or later they’ll find the answers. He continued through the house, tensing whenever the floor creaked.
The streets were clear; few people were up at this time of day. He stopped for a minute and forced
himself to focus.I don’t need a horse. Saphira will be my steed, but she needs a saddle. She can hunt for
both of us, so I don’t have to worry about food—though I should get some anyway. Whatever else I
need I can find buried in our house.
He went to Gedric’s tanning vats on the outskirts of Carvahall. The vile smell made him cringe, but he
kept moving, heading for a shack set into the side of a hill where the cured hides were stored. He cut
down three large ox hides from the rows of skins hanging from the ceiling. The thievery made him feel
guilty, but he reasoned,It’s not really stealing. I’ll pay Gedric back someday, along with Horst. He rolled
up the thick leather and took it to a stand of trees away from the village. He wedged the hides between
the branches of a tree, then returned to Carvahall.
Now for food.He went to the tavern, intending to get it there, but then smiled tightly and reversed
direction. If he was going to steal, it might as well be from Sloan. He sneaked up to the butcher’s house.
The front door was barred whenever Sloan was not there, but the side door was secured with only a thin
chain, which he broke easily. The rooms inside were dark. He fumbled blindly until his hands came upon
hard piles of meat wrapped in cloth. He stuffed as many of them as he could under his shirt, then hurried
back to the street and furtively closed the door.
A woman shouted his name nearby. He clasped the bottom of his shirt to keep the meat from falling out
and ducked behind a corner. He shivered as Horst walked between two houses not ten feet away.
Eragon ran as soon as Horst was out of sight. His legs burned as he pounded down an alley and back to
the trees. He slipped between the tree trunks, then turned to see if he was being pursued. No one was
there. Relieved, he let out his breath and reached into the tree for the leather. It was gone.
“Going somewhere?”
Eragon whirled around. Brom scowled angrily at him, an ugly wound on the side of his head. A short
sword hung at his belt in a brown sheath. The hides were in his hands.
Eragon’s eyes narrowed in irritation. How had the old man managed to sneak up on him? Everything
had been so quiet, he would have sworn that no one was around. “Give them back,” he snapped.
“Why? So you can run off before Garrow is even buried?” The accusation was sharp.
“It’s none of your business!” he barked, temper flashing. “Why did you follow me?”
“I didn’t,” grunted Brom. “I’ve been waiting for you here. Now where are you going?”
“Nowhere.” Eragon lunged for the skins and grabbed them from Brom’s hands. Brom did nothing to
stop him.
“I hope you have enough meat to feed your dragon.”

Page 58

Eragon froze. “What are you talking about?”
Brom crossed his arms. “Don’t fool with me. I know where that mark on your hand, the gedwëy ignasia,
theshining palm, comes from: you have touched a dragon hatchling. I know why you came to me with
those questions, and I know that once more the Riders live.”
Eragon dropped the leather and meat.It’s finally happened… I have to get away! I can’t run faster than
him with my injured legs, but if… Saphira! he called.
For a few agonizing seconds she did not answer, but then,Yes.
We’ve been discovered! I need you!He sent her a picture of where he was, and she took off
immediately. Now he just had to stall Brom. “How did you find out?” he asked in a hollow voice.
Brom stared into the distance and moved his lips soundlessly as if he were talking to someone else. Then
he said, “There were clues and hints everywhere; I had only to pay attention. Anyone with the right
knowledge could have done the same. Tell me, how is your dragon?”
“She,” said Eragon, “is fine. We weren’t at the farm when the strangers came.”
“Ah, your legs. You were flying?”
How did Brom figure that out? What if the strangers coerced him into doing this? Maybe they want him
to discover where I’m going so they can ambush us. And where is Saphira?He reached out with his mind
and found her circling far overhead.Come!
No, I will watch for a time.
Why!
Because of the slaughter at Dorú Areaba.
What?
Brom leaned against a tree with a slight smile. “I have talked with her, and she has agreed to stay above
us until we settle our differences. As you can see, you really don’t have any choice but to answer my
questions. Now tell me, where are you going?”
Bewildered, Eragon put a hand to his temple.How could Brom speak to Saphira? The back of his head
throbbed and ideas whirled through his mind, but he kept reaching the same conclusion: he had to tell the
old man something. He said, “I was going to find a safe place to stay while I heal.”
“And after that?”
The question could not be ignored. The throbbing in his head grew worse. It was impossible to think;
nothing seemed clear anymore. All he wanted to do was tell someone about the events of the past few
months. It tore at him that his secret had caused Garrow’s death. He gave up and said tremulously, “I
was going to hunt down the strangers and kill them.”
“A mighty task for one so young,” Brom said in a normal tone, as if Eragon had proposed the most

Page 59

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

obvious and suitable thing to do. “Certainly a worthy endeavor and one you are fit to carry out, yet it
strikes me that help would not be unwelcome.” He reached behind a bush and pulled out a large pack.
His tone became gruff. “Anyway, I’m not going to stay behind while some stripling gets to run around
with a dragon.”
Is he really offering help, or is it a trap?Eragon was afraid of what his mysterious enemies could do.But
Brom convinced Saphira to trust him, and they’ve talked through the mind touch. If she isn’t worried…
He decided to put his suspicions aside for the present. “I don’t need help,” said Eragon, then grudgingly
added, “but you can come.”
“Then we had best be going,” said Brom. His face blanked for a moment. “I think you’ll find that your
dragon will listen to you again.”
Saphira?asked Eragon.
Yes.
He resisted the urge to question her.Will you meet us at the farm?
Yes. So you reached an agreement?
I guess so.She broke contact and soared away. He glanced at Carvahall and saw people running from
house to house. “I think they’re looking for me.”
Brom raised an eyebrow. “Probably. Shall we go?”
Eragon hesitated. “I’d like to leave a message for Roran. It doesn’t seem right to run off without telling
him why.”
“It’s been taken care of,” assured Brom. “I left a letter for him with Gertrude, explaining a few things. I
also cautioned him to be on guard for certain dangers. Is that satisfactory?”
Eragon nodded. He wrapped the leather around the meat and started off. They were careful to stay out
of sight until they reached the road, then quickened their pace, eager to distance themselves from
Carvahall. Eragon plowed ahead determinedly, his legs burning. The mindless rhythm of walking freed his
mind to think.Once we get home, I won’t travel any farther with Brom until I get some answers, he told
himself firmly. I hope that he can tell me more about the Riders and whom I’m fighting.
As the wreckage of the farm came into view, Brom’s eyebrows beetled with anger. Eragon was
dismayed to see how swiftly nature was reclaiming the farm. Snow and dirt were already piled inside the
house, concealing the violence of the strangers’ attack. All that remained of the barn was a rapidly
eroding rectangle of soot.
Brom’s head snapped up as the sound of Saphira’s wings drifted over the trees. She dived past them
from behind, almost brushing their heads. They staggered as a wall of air buffeted them. Saphira’s scales
glittered as she wheeled over the farm and landed gracefully.
Brom stepped forward with an expression both solemn and joyous. His eyes were shining, and a tear
shone on his cheek before it disappeared into his beard. He stood there for a long while, breathing
heavily as he watched Saphira, and she him. Eragon heard him muttering and edged closer to listen.

“So… it starts again. But how and where will it end? My sight is veiled; I cannot tell if this be tragedy or
farce, for the elements of both are here… However it may be, my station is unchanged, and I…”
Whatever else he might have said faded away as Saphira proudly approached them. Eragon passed
Brom, pretended he had heard nothing, and greeted her. There was something different between them
now, as if they knew each other even more intimately, yet were still strangers. He rubbed her neck, and
his palm tingled as their minds touched. A strong curiosity came from her.
I’ve seen no humans except you and Garrow, and he was badly injured,she said.
You’ve viewed people through my eyes.
It’s not the same.She came closer and turned her long head so that she could inspect Brom with one
large blue eye.You really are queer creatures, she said critically, and continued to stare at him. Brom held
still as she sniffed the air, and then he extended a hand to her. Saphira slowly bowed her head and
allowed him to touch her on the brow. With a snort, she jerked back and retreated behind Eragon. Her
tail flicked over the ground.
What is it?he asked. She did not answer.
Brom turned to him and asked in an undertone, “What’s her name?”
“Saphira.” A peculiar expression crossed Brom’s face. He ground the butt of his staff into the earth with
such force his knuckles turned white. “Of all the names you gave me, it was the only one she liked. I think
it fits,” Eragon added quickly.
“Fit it does,” said Brom. There was something in his voice Eragon could not identify. Was it loss,
wonder, fear, envy? He was not sure; it could have been none of them or all. Brom raised his voice and
said, “Greetings, Saphira. I am honored to meet you.” He twisted his hand in a strange gesture and
bowed.
I like him,said Saphira quietly.
Of course you do; everyone enjoys flattery.Eragon touched her on the shoulder and went to the ruined
house. Saphira trailed behind with Brom. The old man looked vibrant and alive.
Eragon climbed into the house and crawled under a door into what was left of his room. He barely
recognized it under the piles of shattered wood. Guided by memory, he searched where the inside wall
had been and found his empty pack. Part of the frame was broken, but the damage could be easily
repaired. He kept rummaging and eventually uncovered the end of his bow, which was still in its buckskin
tube.
Though the leather was scratched and scuffed, he was pleased to see that the oiled wood was
unharmed.Finally, some luck. He strung the bow and pulled on the sinew experimentally. It bent
smoothly, without any snaps or creaks. Satisfied, he hunted for his quiver, which he found buried nearby.
Many of the arrows were broken.
He unstrung the bow and handed it and the quiver to Brom, who said, “It takes a strong arm to pull
that.” Eragon took the compliment silently. He picked through the rest of the house for other useful items
and dumped the collection next to Brom. It was a meager pile. “What now?” asked Brom. His eyes were
sharp and inquisitive. Eragon looked away.

Page 61

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“We find a place to hide.”
“Do you have somewhere in mind?”
“Yes.” He wrapped all the supplies, except for his bow, into a tight bundle and tied it shut. Hefting it
onto his back, he said, “This way,” and headed into the forest.Saphira, follow us in the air. Your
footprints are too easily found and tracked.
Very well.She took off behind them.
Their destination was nearby, but Eragon took a circuitous route in an effort to baffle any pursuers. It
was well over an hour before he finally stopped in a well-concealed bramble.
The irregular clearing in the center was just large enough for a fire, two people, and a dragon. Red
squirrels scampered into the trees, chattering in protest at their intrusion. Brom extricated himself from a
vine and looked around with interest. “Does anyone else know of this?” he asked.
“No. I found it when we first moved here. It took me a week to dig into the center, and another week to
clear out all the deadwood.” Saphira landed beside them and folded her wings, careful to avoid the
thorns. She curled up, snapping twigs with her hard scales, and rested her head on the ground. Her
unreadable eyes followed them closely.
Brom leaned against his staff and fixed his gaze on her. His scrutiny made Eragon nervous.
Eragon watched them until hunger forced him to action. He built a fire, filled a pot with snow, and then
set it over the flames to melt. When the water was hot, he tore off chunks of meat and dropped them into
the pot with a lump of salt.Not much of a meal, he thought grimly,but it’ll do. I’ll probably be eating this
for some time to come, so I might as well get used to it.
The stew simmered quietly, spreading a rich aroma through the clearing. The tip of Saphira’s tongue
snaked out and tasted the air. When the meat was tender, Brom came over and Eragon served the food.
They ate silently, avoiding each other’s eyes. Afterward, Brom pulled out his pipe and lit it leisurely.
“Why do you want to travel with me?” asked Eragon.
A cloud of smoke left Brom’s lips and spiraled up through the trees until it disappeared. “I have a vested
interest in keeping you alive,” he said.
“What do you mean?” demanded Eragon.
“To put it bluntly, I’m a storyteller and I happen to think that you will make a fine story. You’re the first
Rider to exist outside of the king’s control for over a hundred years. What will happen? Will you perish
as a martyr? Will you join the Varden? Or will you kill King Galbatorix? All fascinating questions. And I
will be there to see every bit of it, no matter what I have to do.”
A knot formed in Eragon’s stomach. He could not see himself doing any of those things, least of all
becoming a martyr.I want my vengeance, but for the rest…. I have no ambition. “That may be, but tell
me, how can you talk with Saphira?”
Brom took his time putting more tobacco in his pipe. Once it was relit and firmly in his mouth, he said,

Page 62

“Very well, if it’s answers you want, it’s answers you’ll get, but they may not be to your liking.” He got
up, brought his pack over to the fire, and pulled out a long object wrapped in cloth. It was about five feet
long and, from the way he handled it, rather heavy.
He peeled away the cloth, strip by strip, like a mummy being unswathed. Eragon gazed, transfixed, as a
sword was revealed. The gold pommel was teardrop shaped with the sides cut away to reveal a ruby the
size of a small egg. The hilt was wrapped in silver wire, burnished until it gleamed like starlight. The
sheath was wine red and smooth as glass, adorned solely by a strange black symbol etched into it. Next
to the sword was a leather belt with a heavy buckle. The last strip fell away, and Brom passed the
weapon to Eragon.
The handle fit Eragon’s hand as if it had been made for him. He slowly drew the sword; it slid
soundlessly from the sheath. The flat blade was iridescent red and shimmered in the firelight. The keen
edges curved gracefully to a sharp point. A duplicate of the black symbol was inscribed on the metal.
The balance of the sword was perfect; it felt like an extension of his arm, unlike the rude farm tools he
was used to. An air of power lay over it, as if an unstoppable force resided in its core. It had been
created for the violent convulsions of battle, to end men’s lives, yet it held a terrible beauty.
“This was once a Rider’s blade,” said Brom gravely. “When a Rider finished his training, the elves would
present him with a sword. Their methods of forging have always remained secret. However, their swords
are eternally sharp and will never stain. The custom was to have the blade’s color match that of the
Rider’s dragon, but I think we can make an exception in this case. This sword is named Zar’roc. I don’t
know what it means, probably something personal to the Rider who owned it.” He watched Eragon
swing the sword.
“Where did you get it?” asked Eragon. He reluctantly slipped the blade back into the sheath and
attempted to hand the sword back, but Brom made no move to take it.
“It doesn’t matter,” said Brom. “I will only say that it took me a series of nasty and dangerous
adventures to attain it. Consider it yours. You have more of a claim to it than I do, and before all is done,
I think you will need it.”
The offer caught Eragon off guard. “It is a princely gift, thank you.” Unsure of what else to say, he slid
his hand down the sheath. “What is this symbol?” he asked.
“That was the Rider’s personal crest.” Eragon tried to interrupt, but Brom glared at him until he was
quiet. “Now, if you must know, anyone can learn how to speak to a dragon if they have the proper
training. And,” he raised a finger for emphasis, “it doesn’t mean anything if they can. I know more about
the dragons and their abilities than almost anyone else alive. On your own it might take years to learn
what I can teach you. I’m offering my knowledge as a shortcut. As for how I know so much, I will keep
that to myself.”
Saphira pulled herself up as he finished speaking and prowled over to Eragon. He pulled out the blade
and showed her the sword.It has power, she said, touching the point with her nose. The metal’s
iridescent color rippled like water as it met her scales. She lifted her head with a satisfied snort, and the
sword resumed its normal appearance. Eragon sheathed it, troubled.
Brom raised an eyebrow. “That’s the sort of thing I’m talking about. Dragons will constantly amaze you.
Things… happen around them, mysterious things that are impossible anywhere else. Even though the
Riders worked with dragons for centuries, they never completely understood their abilities. Some say that
even the dragons don’t know the full extent of their own powers. They are linked with this land in a way

that lets them overcome great obstacles. What Saphira just did illustrates my earlier point: there is much
you don’t know.”
There was a long pause. “That may be,” said Eragon, “but I can learn. And the strangers are the most
important thing I need to know about right now. Do you have any idea who they are?”
Brom took a deep breath. “They are called the Ra’zac. No one knows if that’s the name of their race or
what they have chosen to call themselves. Either way, if they have individual names, they keep them
hidden. The Ra’zac were never seen before Galbatorix came to power. He must have found them during
his travels and enlisted them in his service. Little or nothing is known about them. However, I can tell you
this: they aren’t human. When I glimpsed one’s head, it appeared to have something resembling a beak
and black eyes as large as my fist—though how they manage our speech is a mystery to me. Doubtless
the rest of their bodies are just as twisted. That is why they cover themselves with cloaks at all times,
regardless of the weather.
“As for their powers, they are stronger than any man and can jump incredible heights, but they cannot
use magic. Be thankful for that, because if they could, you would already be in their grasp. I also know
they have a strong aversion to sunlight, though it won’t stop them if they’re determined. Don’t make the
mistake of underestimating a Ra’zac, for they are cunning and full of guile.”
“How many of them are there?” asked Eragon, wondering how Brom could possibly know so much.
“As far as I know, only the two you saw. There might be more, but I’ve never heard of them. Perhaps
they’re the last of a dying race. You see, they are the king’s personal dragon hunters. Whenever rumors
reach Galbatorix of a dragon in the land, he sends the Ra’zac to investigate. A trail of death often follows
them.” Brom blew a series of smoke rings and watched them float up between the brambles. Eragon
ignored the rings until he noticed that they were changing color and darting around. Brom winked slyly.
Eragon was sure that no one had seen Saphira, so how could Galbatorix have heard about her? When
he voiced his objections, Brom said, “You’re right, it seems unlikely that anyone from Carvahall could
have informed the king. Why don’t you tell me where you got the egg and how you raised Saphira—that
might clarify the issue.”
Eragon hesitated, then recounted all the events since he had found the egg in the Spine. It felt wonderful
to finally confide in someone. Brom asked a few questions, but most of the time he listened intently. The
sun was about to set when Eragon finished his tale. Both of them were quiet as the clouds turned a soft
pink. Eragon eventually broke the silence. “I just wish I knew where she came from. And Saphira
doesn’t remember.”
Brom cocked his head. “I don’t know… You’ve made many things clear to me. I am sure that no one
besides us has seen Saphira. The Ra’zac must have had a source of information outside of this valley, one
who is probably dead by now… You have had a hard time and done much. I’m impressed.”
Eragon stared blankly into the distance, then asked, “What happened to your head? It looks like you
were hit with a rock.”
“No, but that’s a good guess.” He took a deep pull on the pipe. “I was sneaking around the Ra’zac’s
camp after dark, trying to learn what I could, when they surprised me in the shadows. It was a good trap,
but they underestimated me, and I managed to drive them away. Not, however,” he said wryly, “without
this token of my stupidity. Stunned, I fell to the ground and didn’t regain consciousness until the next day.
By then they had already arrived at your farm. It was too late to stop them, but I set out after them

Page 64

anyway. That’s when we met on the road.”
Who is he to think that he could take on the Ra’zac alone? They ambushed him in the dark, and he was
only stunned?Unsettled, Eragon asked hotly, “When you saw the mark, the gedwëy ignasia, on my palm,
why didn’t you tell me who the Ra’zac were? I would have warned Garrow instead of going to Saphira
first, and the three of us could have fled.”
Brom sighed. “I was unsure of what to do at the time. I thought I could keep the Ra’zac away from you
and, once they had left, confront you about Saphira. But they outsmarted me. It’s a mistake that I deeply
regret, and one that has cost you dearly.”
“Who are you?” demanded Eragon, suddenly bitter. “How come a mere village storyteller happens to
have a Rider’s sword? How do you know about the Ra’zac?”
Brom tapped his pipe. “I thought I made it clear I wasn’t going to talk about that.”
“My uncle is dead because of this.Dead! ” exclaimed Eragon, slashing a hand through the air. “I’ve
trusted you this far because Saphira respects you, but no more! You’re not the person I’ve known in
Carvahall for all of these years. Explain yourself!”
For a long time Brom stared at the smoke swirling between them, deep lines creasing his forehead.
When he stirred, it was only to take another puff. Finally he said, “You’ve probably never thought about
it, but most of my life has been spent outside of Palancar Valley. It was only in Carvahall that I took up
the mantle of storyteller. I have played many roles to different people—I’ve a complicated past. It was
partly through a desire to escape it that I came here. So no, I’m not the man you think I am.”
“Ha!” snorted Eragon. “Then who are you?”
Brom smiled gently. “I am one who is here to help you. Do not scorn those words—they are the truest
I’ve ever spoken. But I’m not going to answer your questions. At this point you don’t need to hear my
history, nor have you yet earned that right. Yes, I have knowledge Brom the storyteller wouldn’t, but I’m
more than he. You’ll have to learn to live with that fact and the fact that I don’t hand out descriptions of
my life to anyone who asks!”
Eragon glared at him sullenly. “I’m going to sleep,” he said, leaving the fire.
Brom did not seem surprised, but there was sorrow in his eyes. He spread his bedroll next to the fire as
Eragon lay beside Saphira. An icy silence fell over the camp.
SADDLEMAKING
When Eragon’s eyes opened, the memory of Garrow’s death crashed down on him. He pulled the
blankets over his head and cried quietly under their warm darkness. It felt good just to lie there… to hide
from the world outside. Eventually the tears stopped. He cursed Brom. Then he reluctantly wiped his
cheeks and got up.
Brom was making breakfast. “Good morning,” he said. Eragon grunted in reply. He jammed his cold
fingers in his armpits and crouched by the fire until the food was ready. They ate quickly, trying to
consume the food before it lost its warmth. When he finished, Eragon washed his bowl with snow, then
spread the stolen leather on the ground.

Page 65

“What are you going to do with that?” asked Brom. “We can’t carry it with us.”
“I’m going to make a saddle for Saphira.”
“Mmm,” said Brom, moving forward. “Well, dragons used to have two kinds of saddles. The first was
hard and molded like a horse’s saddle. But those take time and tools to make, neither of which we have.
The other was thin and lightly padded, nothing more than an extra layer between the Rider and dragon.
Those saddles were used whenever speed and flexibility were important, though they weren’t nearly as
comfortable as the molded ones.”
“Do you know what they looked like?” asked Eragon.
“Better, I can make one.”
“Then please do,” said Eragon, standing aside.
“Very well, but pay attention. Someday you may have to do this for yourself.” With Saphira’s
permission, Brom measured her neck and chest. Then he cut five bands out of the leather and outlined a
dozen or so shapes on the hides. Once the pieces had been sliced out, he cut what remained of the hides
into long cords.
Brom used the cords to sew everything together, but for each stitch, two holes had to be bored through
the leather. Eragon helped with that. Intricate knots were rigged in place of buckles, and every strap was
made extra long so the saddle would still fit Saphira in the coming months.
The main part of the saddle was assembled from three identical sections sewn together with padding
between them. Attached to the front was a thick loop that would fit snugly around one of Saphira’s neck
spikes, while wide bands sewn on either side would wrap around her belly and tie underneath. Taking the
place of stirrups were a series of loops running down both bands. Tightened, they would hold Eragon’s
legs in place. A long strap was constructed to pass between Saphira’s front legs, split in two, and then
come up behind her front legs to rejoin with the saddle.
While Brom worked, Eragon repaired his pack and organized their supplies. The day was spent by the
time their tasks were completed. Weary from his labor, Brom put the saddle on Saphira and checked to
see that the straps fit. He made a few small adjustments, then took it off, satisfied.
“You did a good job,” Eragon acknowledged grudgingly.
Brom inclined his head. “One tries his best. It should serve you well; the leather’s sturdy enough.”
Aren’t you going to try it out?asked Saphira.
Maybe tomorrow,said Eragon, storing the saddle with his blankets.It’s too late now. In truth he was not
eager to fly again—not after the disastrous outcome of his last attempt.
Dinner was made quickly. It tasted good even though it was simple. While they ate, Brom looked over
the fire at Eragon and asked, “Will we leave tomorrow?”
“There isn’t any reason to stay.”
“I suppose not…” He shifted. “Eragon, I must apologize about how events have turned out. I never

Page 66

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

wished for this to happen. Your family did not deserve such a tragedy. If there were anything I could do
to reverse it, I would. This is a terrible situation for all of us.” Eragon sat in silence, avoiding Brom’s gaze,
then Brom said, “We’re going to need horses.”
“Maybe you do, but I have Saphira.”
Brom shook his head. “There isn’t a horse alive that can outrun a flying dragon, and Saphira is too young
to carry us both. Besides, it’ll be safer if we stay together, and riding is faster than walking.”
“But that’ll make it harder to catch the Ra’zac,” protested Eragon. “On Saphira, I could probably find
them within a day or two. On horses, it’ll take much longer—if it’s even possible to overtake their lead
on the ground!”
Brom said slowly, “That’s a chance you’ll have to take if I’m to accompany you.”
Eragon thought it over. “All right,” he grumbled, “we’ll get horses. But you have to buy them. I don’t
have any money, and I don’t want to steal again. It’s wrong.”
“That depends on your point of view,” corrected Brom with a slight smile. “Before you set out on this
venture, remember that your enemies, the Ra’zac, are the king’s servants. They will be protected
wherever they go. Laws do not stop them. In cities they’ll have access to abundant resources and willing
servants. Also keep in mind that nothing is more important to Galbatorix than recruiting or killing
you—though word of your existence probably hasn’t reached him yet. The longer you evade the Ra’zac,
the more desperate he’ll become. He’ll know that every day you’ll be growing stronger and that each
passing moment will give you another chance to join his enemies. You must be very careful, as you may
easily turn from the hunter into the hunted.”
Eragon was subdued by the strong words. Pensive, he rolled a twig between his fingers. “Enough talk,”
said Brom. “It’s late and my bones ache. We can say more tomorrow.” Eragon nodded and banked the
fire.
THERINSFORD
Dawn was gray and overcast with a cutting wind. The forest was quiet. After a light breakfast, Brom and
Eragon doused the fire and shouldered their packs, preparing to leave. Eragon hung his bow and quiver
on the side of his pack where he could easily reach them. Saphira wore the saddle; she would have to
carry it until they got horses. Eragon carefully tied Zar’roc onto her back, too, as he did not want the
extra weight. Besides, in his hands the sword would be no better than a club.
Eragon had felt safe inside the bramble, but outside, wariness crept into his movements. Saphira took off
and circled overhead. The trees thinned as they returned to the farm.
I will see this place again,Eragon insisted to himself, looking at the ruined buildings.This cannot, will not,
be a permanent exile. Someday when it’s safe, I’ll return… Throwing back his shoulders, he faced south
and the strange, barbaric lands that lay there.
As they walked, Saphira veered west toward the mountains and out of sight. Eragon felt uncomfortable
as he watched her go. Even now, with no one around, they could not spend their days together. She had
to stay hidden in case they met a fellow traveler.
The Ra’zac’s footprints were faint on the eroding snow, but Eragon was unconcerned. It was unlikely

Page 67

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

that they had forsaken the road, which was the easiest way out of the valley, for the wilderness. Once
outside the valley, however, the road divided in several places. It would be difficult to ascertain which
branch the Ra’zac had taken.
They traveled in silence, concentrating on speed. Eragon’s legs continued to bleed where the scabs had
cracked. To take his mind off the discomfort, he asked, “So what exactly can dragons do? You said that
you knew something of their abilities.”
Brom laughed, his sapphire ring flashing in the air as he gestured. “Unfortunately, it’s a pitiful amount
compared to what I would like to know. Your question is one people have been trying to answer for
centuries, so understand that what I tell you is by its very nature incomplete. Dragons have always been
mysterious, though maybe not on purpose.
“Before I can truly answer your question, you need a basic education on the subject of dragons. It’s
hopelessly confusing to start in the middle of such a complex topic without understanding the foundation
on which it stands. I’ll begin with the life cycle of dragons, and if that doesn’t wear you out, we can
continue to another topic.”
Brom explained how dragons mate and what it took for their eggs to hatch. “You see,” he said, “when a
dragon lays an egg, the infant inside is ready to hatch. But it waits, sometimes for years, for the right
circumstances. When dragons lived in the wild, those circumstances were usually dictated by the
availability of food. However, once they formed an alliance with the elves, a certain number of their eggs,
usually no more than one or two, were given to the Riders each year. These eggs, or rather the infants
inside, wouldn’t hatch until the person destined to be its Rider came into their presence—though how
they sensed that isn’t known. People used to line up to touch the eggs, hoping that one of them might be
picked.”
“Do you mean that Saphira might not have hatched for me?” asked Eragon.
“Quite possibly, if she hadn’t liked you.”
He felt honored that of all the people in Alagaësia, she had chosen him. He wondered how long she had
been waiting, then shuddered at the thought of being cramped inside an egg, surrounded by darkness.
Brom continued his lecture. He explained what and when dragons ate. A fully grown sedentary dragon
could go for months without food, but in mating season they had to eat every week. Some plants could
heal their sicknesses, while others would make them ill. There were various ways to care for their claws
and clean their scales.
He explained the techniques to use when attacking from a dragon and what to do if you were fighting
one, whether on foot, horseback, or with another dragon. Their bellies were armored; their armpits were
not. Eragon constantly interrupted to ask questions, and Brom seemed pleased by the inquiries. Hours
passed unheeded as they talked.
When evening came, they were near Therinsford. As the sky darkened and they searched for a place to
camp, Eragon asked, “Who was the Rider that owned Zar’roc?”
“A mighty warrior,” said Brom, “who was much feared in his time and held great power.”
“What was his name?”

Page 68

“I’ll not say.” Eragon protested, but Brom was firm. “I don’t want to keep you ignorant, far from it, but
certain knowledge would only prove dangerous and distracting for you right now. There isn’t any reason
for me to trouble you with such things until you have the time and the power to deal with them. I only
wish to protect you from those who would use you for evil.”
Eragon glared at him. “You know what? I think you just enjoy speaking in riddles. I’ve half a mind to
leave you so I don’t have to be bothered with them. If you’re going to say something, then say it instead
of dancing around with vague phrases!”
“Peace. All will be told in time,” Brom said gently. Eragon grunted, unconvinced.
They found a comfortable place to spend the night and set up camp. Saphira joined them as dinner was
being set on the fire.Did you have time to hunt for food? asked Eragon.
She snorted with amusement.If the two of you were any slower, I would have time to fly across the sea
and back without falling behind.
You don’t have to be insulting. Besides, we’ll go faster once we have horses.
She let out a puff of smoke.Maybe, but will it be enough to catch the Ra’zac? They have a lead of
several days and many leagues. And I’m afraid they may suspect we’re following them. Why else would
they have destroyed the farm in such a spectacular manner, unless they wished to provoke you into
chasing them?
I don’t know,said Eragon, disturbed. Saphira curled up beside him, and he leaned against her belly,
welcoming the warmth. Brom sat on the other side of the fire, whittling two long sticks. He suddenly
threw one at Eragon, who grabbed it out of reflex as it whirled over the crackling flames.
“Defend yourself!” barked Brom, standing.
Eragon looked at the stick in his hand and saw that it was shaped in the crude likeness of a sword. Brom
wanted to fight him? What chance did the old man stand?If he wants to play this game, so be it, but if he
thinks to beat me, he’s in for a surprise.
He rose as Brom circled the fire. They faced each other for a moment, then Brom charged, swinging his
stick. Eragon tried to block the attack but was too slow. He yelped as Brom struck him on the ribs, and
stumbled backward.
Without thinking, he lunged forward, but Brom easily parried the blow. Eragon whipped the stick
toward Brom’s head, twisted it at the last moment, and then tried to hit his side. The solid smack of
wood striking wood resounded through the camp. “Improvisation—good!” exclaimed Brom, eyes
gleaming. His arm moved in a blur, and there was an explosion of pain on the side of Eragon’s head. He
collapsed like an empty sack, dazed.
A splash of cold water roused him to alertness, and he sat up, sputtering. His head was ringing, and
there was dried blood on his face. Brom stood over him with a pan of melted snow water. “You didn’t
have to do that,” said Eragon angrily, pushing himself up. He felt dizzy and unsteady.
Brom arched an eyebrow. “Oh? A real enemy wouldn’t soften his blows, and neither will I. Should I
pander to your… incompetence so you’ll feel better? I don’t think so.” He picked up the stick that
Eragon had dropped and held it out. “Now, defend yourself.”

Page 69

Eragon stared blankly at the piece of wood, then shook his head. “Forget it; I’ve had enough.” He
turned away and stumbled as he was whacked loudly across the back. He spun around, growling.
“Never turn your back to the enemy!” snapped Brom, then tossed the stick at him and attacked. Eragon
retreated around the fire, beneath the onslaught. “Pull your arms in. Keep your knees bent,” shouted
Brom. He continued to give instructions, then paused to show Eragon exactly how to execute a certain
move. “Do it again, but this timeslowly !” They slid through the forms with exaggerated motions before
returning to their furious battle. Eragon learned quickly, but no matter what he tried, he could not hold
Brom off for more than a few blows.
When they finished, Eragon flopped on his blankets and groaned. He hurt everywhere—Brom had not
been gentle with his stick. Saphira let out a long, coughing growl and curled her lip until a formidable row
of teeth showed.
What’s wrong with you?he demanded irritably.
Nothing,she replied.It’s funny to see a hatchling like you beaten by the old one. She made the sound
again, and Eragon turned red as he realized that she was laughing. Trying to preserve some dignity, he
rolled onto his side and fell asleep.
He felt even worse the next day. Bruises covered his arms, and he was almost too sore to move. Brom
looked up from the mush he was serving and grinned. “How do you feel?” Eragon grunted and bolted
down the breakfast.
Once on the road, they traveled swiftly so as to reach Therinsford before noon. After a league, the road
widened and they saw smoke in the distance. “You’d better tell Saphira to fly ahead and wait for us on
the other side of Therinsford,” said Brom. “She has to be careful here, otherwise people are bound to
notice her.”
“Why don’t you tell her yourself?” challenged Eragon.
“It’s considered bad manners to interfere with another’s dragon.”
“You didn’t have a problem with it in Carvahall.”
Brom’s lips twitched with a smile. “I did what I had to.”
Eragon eyed him darkly, then relayed the instructions. Saphira warned,Be careful; the Empire’s servants
could be hiding anywhere.
As the ruts in the road deepened, Eragon noticed more footprints. Farms signaled their approach to
Therinsford. The village was larger than Carvahall, but it had been constructed haphazardly, the houses
aligned in no particular order.
“What a mess,” said Eragon. He could not see Dempton’s mill.Baldor and Albriech have surely fetched
Roran by now. Either way, Eragon had no wish to face his cousin.
“It’s ugly, if nothing else,” agreed Brom.
The Anora River flowed between them and the town, spanned by a stout bridge. As they approached it,

Page 70

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

a greasy man stepped from behind a bush and barred their way. His shirt was too short, and his dirty
stomach spilled over a rope belt. Behind his cracked lips, his teeth looked like crumbling tombstones.
“You c’n stop right there. This’s my bridge. Gotta pay t’ get over.”
“How much?” asked Brom in a resigned voice. He pulled out a pouch, and the bridgekeeper brightened.
“Five crowns,” he said, pulling his lips into a broad smile. Eragon’s temper flared at the exorbitant price,
and he started to complain hotly, but Brom silenced him with a quick look. The coins were wordlessly
handed over. The man put them into a sack hanging from his belt. “Thank’ee much,” he said in a mocking
tone, and stood out of the way.
As Brom stepped forward, he stumbled and caught the bridgekeeper’s arm to support himself. “Watch
y’re step,” snarled the grimy man, sidling away.
“Sorry,” apologized Brom, and continued over the bridge with Eragon.
“Why didn’t you haggle? He skinned you alive!” exclaimed Eragon when they were out of earshot. “He
probably doesn’t even own the bridge. We could have pushed right past him.”
“Probably,” agreed Brom.
“Then why pay him?”
“Because you can’t argue with all of the fools in the world. It’s easier to let them have their way, then
trick them when they’re not paying attention.” Brom opened his hand, and a pile of coins glinted in the
light.
“You cut his purse!” said Eragon incredulously.
Brom pocketed the money with a wink. “And it held a surprising amount. He should know better than to
keep all these coins in one place.” There was a sudden howl of anguish from the other side of the river.
“I’d say our friend has just discovered his loss. If you see any watchmen, tell me.” He grabbed the
shoulder of a young boy running between the houses and asked, “Do you know where we can buy
horses?” The child stared at them with solemn eyes, then pointed to a large barn near the edge of
Therinsford. “Thank you,” said Brom, tossing him a small coin.
The barn’s large double doors were open, revealing two long rows of stalls. The far wall was covered
with saddles, harnesses, and other paraphernalia. A man with muscular arms stood at the end, brushing a
white stallion. He raised a hand and beckoned for them to come over.
As they approached, Brom said, “That’s a beautiful animal.”
“Yes indeed. His name’s Snowfire. Mine’s Haberth.” Haberth offered a rough palm and shook hands
vigorously with Eragon and Brom. There was a polite pause as he waited for their names in return. When
they were not forthcoming, he asked, “Can I help you?”
Brom nodded. “We need two horses and a full set of tack for both. The horses have to be fast and
tough; we’ll be doing a lot of traveling.”
Haberth was thoughtful for a moment. “I don’t have many animals like that, and the ones I do aren’t
cheap.” The stallion moved restlessly; he calmed it with a few strokes of his fingers.

Page 71

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“Price is no object. I’ll take the best you have,” said Brom. Haberth nodded and silently tied the stallion
to a stall. He went to the wall and started pulling down saddles and other items. Soon he had two
identical piles. Next he walked up the line of stalls and brought out two horses. One was a light bay, the
other a roan. The bay tugged against his rope.
“He’s a little spirited, but with a firm hand you won’t have any problems,” said Haberth, handing the
bay’s rope to Brom.
Brom let the horse smell his hand; it allowed him to rub its neck. “We’ll take him,” he said, then eyed the
roan. “The other one, however, I’m not so sure of.”
“There are some good legs on him.”
“Mmm… What will you take for Snowfire?”
Haberth looked fondly at the stallion. “I’d rather not sell him. He’s the finest I’ve ever bred—I’m hoping
to sire a whole line from him.”
“If you were willing to part with him, how much would all of this cost me?” asked Brom.
Eragon tried to put his hand on the bay like Brom had, but it shied away. He automatically reached out
with his mind to reassure the horse, stiffening with surprise as he touched the animal’s consciousness. The
contact was not clear or sharp like it was with Saphira, but he could communicate with the bay to a
limited degree. Tentatively, he made it understand that he was a friend. The horse calmed and looked at
him with liquid brown eyes.
Haberth used his fingers to add up the price of the purchase. “Two hundred crowns and no less,” he
said with a smile, clearly confident that no one would pay that much. Brom silently opened his pouch and
counted out the money.
“Will this do?” he asked.
There was a long silence as Haberth glanced between Snowfire and the coins. A sigh, then, “He is
yours, though I go against my heart.”
“I will treat him as if he had been sired by Gildintor, the greatest steed of legend,” said Brom.
“Your words gladden me,” answered Haberth, bowing his head slightly. He helped them saddle the
horses. When they were ready to leave, he said, “Farewell, then. For the sake of Snowfire, I hope that
misfortune does not befall you.”
“Do not fear; I will guard him well,” promised Brom as they departed. “Here,” he said, handing
Snowfire’s reins to Eragon, “go to the far side of Therinsford and wait there.”
“Why?” asked Eragon, but Brom had already slipped away. Annoyed, he exited Therinsford with the
two horses and stationed himself beside the road. To the south he saw the hazy outline of Utgard, sitting
like a giant monolith at the end of the valley. Its peak pierced the clouds and rose out of sight, towering
over the lesser mountains that surrounded it. Its dark, ominous look made Eragon’s scalp tingle.
Brom returned shortly and gestured for Eragon to follow. They walked until Therinsford was hidden by

Page 72

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

trees. Then Brom said, “The Ra’zac definitely passed this way. Apparently they stopped here to pick up
horses, as we did. I was able to find a man who saw them. He described them with many shudders and
said that they galloped out of Therinsford like demons fleeing a holy man.”
“They left quite an impression.”
“Quite.”
Eragon patted the horses. “When we were in the barn, I touched the bay’s mind by accident. I didn’t
know it was possible to do that.”
Brom frowned. “It’s unusual for one as young as you to have the ability. Most Riders had to train for
years before they were strong enough to contact anything other than their dragon.” His face was
thoughtful as he inspected Snowfire. Then he said, “Take everything from your pack, put it into the
saddlebags, and tie the pack on top.” Eragon did so while Brom mounted Snowfire.
Eragon gazed doubtfully at the bay. It was so much smaller than Saphira that for an absurd moment he
wondered if it could bear his weight. With a sigh, he awkwardly got into the saddle. He had only ridden
horses bareback and never for any distance. “Is this going to do the same thing to my legs as riding
Saphira?” he asked.
“How do they feel now?”
“Not too bad, but I think any hard riding will open them up again.”
“We’ll take it easy,” promised Brom. He gave Eragon a few pointers, then they started off at a gentle
pace. Before long the countryside began to change as cultivated fields yielded to wilder land. Brambles
and tangled weeds lined the road, along with huge rosebushes that clung to their clothes. Tall rocks
slanted out of the ground—gray witnesses to their presence. There was an unfriendly feel in the air, an
animosity that resisted intruders.
Above them, growing larger with every step, loomed Utgard, its craggy precipices deeply furrowed with
snowy canyons. The black rock of the mountain absorbed light like a sponge and dimmed the
surrounding area. Between Utgard and the line of mountains that formed the east side of Palancar Valley
was a deep cleft. It was the only practical way out of the valley. The road led toward it.
The horses’ hooves clacked sharply over gravel, and the road dwindled to a skinny trail as it skirted the
base of Utgard. Eragon glanced up at the peak looming over them and was startled to see a steepled
tower perched upon it. The turret was crumbling and in disrepair, but it was still a stern sentinel over the
valley. “What is that?” he asked, pointing.
Brom did not look up, but said sadly and with bitterness, “An outpost of the Riders—one that has lasted
since their founding. That was where Vrael took refuge, and where, through treachery, he was found and
defeated by Galbatorix. When Vrael fell, this area was tainted. Edoc’sil, ‘Unconquerable,’ was the name
of this bastion, for the mountain is so steep none may reach the top unless they can fly. After Vrael’s
death the commoners called it Utgard, but it has another name, Ristvak’baen—the ‘Place of Sorrow.’ It
was known as such to the last Riders before they were killed by the king.”
Eragon stared with awe. Here was a tangible remnant of the Riders’ glory, tarnished though it was by the
relentless pull of time. It struck him then just how old the Riders were. A legacy of tradition and heroism
that stretched back to antiquity had fallen upon him.

They traveled for long hours around Utgard. It formed a solid wall to their right as they entered the
breach that divided the mountain range. Eragon stood in his stirrups; he was impatient to see what lay
outside of Palancar, but it was still too far away. For a while they were in a sloped pass, winding over hill
and gully, following the Anora River. Then, with the sun low behind their backs, they mounted a rise and
saw over the trees.
Eragon gasped. On either side were mountains, but below them stretched a huge plain that extended to
the distant horizon and fused into the sky. The plain was a uniform tan, like the color of dead grass. Long,
wispy clouds swept by overhead, shaped by fierce winds.
He understood now why Brom had insisted on horses. It would have taken them weeks or months to
cover that vast distance on foot. Far above he saw Saphira circling, high enough to be mistaken for a
bird.
“We’ll wait until tomorrow to make the descent,” said Brom. “It’s going to take most of the day, so we
should camp now.”
“How far across is the plain?” Eragon asked, still amazed.
“Two or three days to over a fortnight, depending on which direction we go. Aside from the nomad
tribes that roam this section of the plains, it’s almost as uninhabited as the Hadarac Desert to the east. So
we aren’t going to find many villages. However, to the south the plains are less arid and more heavily
populated.”
They left the trail and dismounted by the Anora River. As they unsaddled the horses, Brom gestured at
the bay. “You should name him.”
Eragon considered it as he picketed the bay. “Well, I don’t have anything as noble as Snowfire, but
maybe this will do.” He placed his hand on the bay and said, “I name you Cadoc. It was my
grandfather’s name, so bear it well.” Brom nodded in approval, but Eragon felt slightly foolish.
When Saphira landed, he asked, How do the plains look?
Dull. There’s nothing but rabbits and scrub in every direction.
After dinner, Brom stood and barked, “Catch!” Eragon barely had time to raise his arm and grab the
piece of wood before it hit him on the head. He groaned as he saw another makeshift sword.
“Not again,” he complained. Brom just smiled and beckoned with one hand. Eragon reluctantly got to
his feet. They whirled around in a flurry of smacking wood, and he backed away with a stinging arm.
The training session was shorter than the first, but it was still long enough for Eragon to amass a new
collection of bruises. When they finished sparring, he threw down the stick in disgust and stalked away
from the fire to nurse his injuries.
THUNDERROAR ANDLIGHTNINGCRACKLE
The next morning Eragon avoided bringing to mind any of the recent events; they were too painful for
him to consider. Instead, he focused his energies on figuring out how to find and kill the Ra’zac.I’ll do it
with my bow, he decided, imagining how the cloaked figures would look with arrows sticking out of

Page 74

them.
He had difficulty even standing up. His muscles cramped with the slightest movement, and one of his
fingers was hot and swollen. When they were ready to leave, he mounted Cadoc and said acidly, “If this
keeps up, you’re going to batter me to pieces.”
“I wouldn’t push you so hard if I didn’t think you were strong enough.”
“For once, I wouldn’t mind being thought less of,” muttered Eragon.
Cadoc pranced nervously as Saphira approached. Saphira eyed the horse with something close to
disgust and said,There’s nowhere to hide on the plains, so I’m not going to bother trying to stay out of
sight. I’ll just fly above you from now on.
She took off, and they began the steep descent. In many places the trail all but disappeared, leaving
them to find their own way down. At times they had to dismount and lead the horses on foot, holding on
to trees to keep from falling down the slope. The ground was scattered with loose rocks, which made the
footing treacherous. The ordeal left them hot and irritable, despite the cold.
They stopped to rest when they reached the bottom near midday. The Anora River veered to their left
and flowed northward. A biting wind scoured the land, whipping them unmercifully. The soil was
parched, and dirt flew into their eyes.
It unnerved Eragon how flat everything was; the plains were unbroken by hummocks or mounds. He had
lived his entire life surrounded by mountains and hills. Without them he felt exposed and vulnerable, like a
mouse under an eagle’s keen eye.
The trail split in three once it reached the plains. The first branch turned north, toward Ceunon, one of
the greatest northern cities; the second one led straight across the plains; and the last went south. They
examined all three for traces of the Ra’zac and eventually found their tracks, heading directly into the
grasslands.
“It seems they’ve gone to Yazuac,” said Brom with a perplexed air.
“Where’s that?”
“Due east and four days away, if all goes well. It’s a small village situated by the Ninor River.” He
gestured at the Anora, which streamed away from them to the north. “Our only supply of water is here.
We’ll have to replenish our waterskins before attempting to cross the plains. There isn’t another pool or
stream between here and Yazuac.”
The excitement of the hunt began to rise within Eragon. In a few days, maybe less than a week, he
would use his arrows to avenge Garrow’s death.And then… He refused to think about what might
happen afterward.
They filled the waterskins, watered the horses, and drank as much as they could from the river. Saphira
joined them and took several gulps of water. Fortified, they turned eastward and started across the
plains.

Eragon decided that it would be the wind that drove him crazy first. Everything that made him
miserable—his chapped lips, parched tongue, and burning eyes—stemmed from it. The ceaseless gusting
followed them throughout the day. Evening only strengthened the wind, instead of subduing it.
Since there was no shelter, they were forced to camp in the open. Eragon found some scrub brush, a
short tough plant that thrived on harsh conditions, and pulled it up. He made a careful pile and tried to
light it, but the woody stems only smoked and gave off a pungent smell. Frustrated, he tossed the
tinderbox to Brom. “I can’t make it burn, especially with this blasted wind. See if you can get it going:
otherwise dinner will be cold.”
Brom knelt by the brush and looked at it critically. He rearranged a couple of branches, then struck the
tinderbox, sending a cascade of sparks onto the plants. There was smoke, but nothing else. Brom
scowled and tried again, but his luck was no better than Eragon’s. “Brisingr!” he swore angrily, striking
the flint again. Flames suddenly appeared, and he stepped back with a pleased expression. “There we
go. It must have been smoldering inside.”
They sparred with mock swords while the food cooked. Fatigue made it hard on both of them, so they
kept the session short. After they had eaten, they lay next to Saphira and slept, grateful for her shelter.
The same cold wind greeted them in the morning, sweeping over the dreadful flatness. Eragon’s lips had
cracked during the night; every time he smiled or talked, beads of blood covered them. Licking them only
made it worse. It was the same for Brom. They let the horses drink sparingly from their supply of water
before mounting them. The day was a monotonous trek of endless plodding.

On the third day, Eragon woke well rested. That, coupled with the fact that the wind had stopped, put
him in a cheery humor. His high spirits were dampened, however, when he saw the sky ahead of them
was dark with thunderheads.
Brom looked at the clouds and grimaced. “Normally I wouldn’t go into a storm like that, but we’re in for
a battering no matter what we do, so we might as well get some distance covered.”
It was still calm when they reached the storm front. As they entered its shadow, Eragon looked up. The
thundercloud had an exotic structure, forming a natural cathedral with a massive arched roof. With some
imagination he could see pillars, windows, soaring tiers, and snarling gargoyles. It was a wild beauty.
As Eragon lowered his gaze, a giant ripple raced toward them through the grass, flattening it. It took him
a second to realize that the wave was a tremendous blast of wind. Brom saw it too, and they hunched
their shoulders, preparing for the storm.
The gale was almost upon them when Eragon had a horrible thought and twisted in his saddle, yelling,
both with his voice and mind,“Saphira! Land!” Brom’s face grew pale. Overhead, they saw her dive
toward the ground.She’s not going to make it!
Saphira angled back the way they had come, to gain time. As they watched, the tempest’s wrath struck
them like a hammer blow. Eragon gasped for breath and clenched the saddle as a frenzied howling filled
his ears. Cadoc swayed and dug his hooves into the ground, mane snapping in the air. The wind tore at
their clothes with invisible fingers while the air darkened with billowing clouds of dust.
Eragon squinted, searching for Saphira. He saw her land heavily and then crouch, clenching the ground

Page 76

with her talons. The wind reached her just as she started to fold her wings. With an angry yank, it
unfurled them and dragged her into the air. For a moment she hung there, suspended by the storm’s
force. Then it slammed her down on her back.
With a savage wrench, Eragon yanked Cadoc around and galloped back up the trail, goading the horse
with both heels and mind.Saphira! he shouted.Try to stay on the ground. I’m coming! He felt a grim
acknowledgment from her. As they neared Saphira, Cadoc balked, so Eragon leapt down and ran
toward her.
His bow banged against his head. A strong gust pushed him off balance and he flew forward, landing on
his chest. He skidded, then got back up with a snarl, ignoring the deep scrapes in his skin.
Saphira was only three yards away, but he could get no closer because of her flailing wings. She
struggled to fold them against the overpowering gale. He rushed at her right wing, intending to hold it
down, but the wind caught her and she somersaulted over him. The spines on her back missed his head
by inches. Saphira clawed at the ground, trying to stay down.
Her wings began to lift again, but before they could flip her, Eragon threw himself at the left one. The
wing crumpled in at the joints and Saphira tucked it firmly against her body. Eragon vaulted over her
back and tumbled onto the other wing. Without warning it was blown upward, sending him sliding to
ground. He broke his fall with a roll, then jumped up and grabbed the wing again. Saphira started to fold
it, and he pushed with all of his strength. The wind battled with them for a second, but with one last surge
they overcame it.
Eragon leaned against Saphira, panting.Are you all right? He could feel her trembling.
She took a moment to answer.I… I think so. She sounded shaken.Nothing’s broken—I couldn’t do
anything; the wind wouldn’t let me go. I was helpless. With a shudder, she fell silent.
He looked at her, concerned.Don’t worry, you’re safe now. He spotted Cadoc a ways off, standing
with his back to the wind. With his mind, Eragon instructed the horse to return to Brom. He then got onto
Saphira. She crept up the road, fighting the gale while he clung to her back and kept his head down.
When they reached Brom, he shouted over the storm, “Is she hurt?”
Eragon shook his head and dismounted. Cadoc trotted over to him, nickering. As he stroked the horse’s
long cheek, Brom pointed at a dark curtain of rain sweeping toward them in rippling gray sheets. “What
else?” cried Eragon, pulling his clothes tighter. He winced as the torrent reached them. The stinging rain
was cold as ice; before long they were drenched and shivering.
Lightning lanced through the sky, flickering in and out of existence. Mile-high blue bolts streaked across
the horizon, followed by peals of thunder that shook the ground below. It was beautiful, but dangerously
so. Here and there, grass fires were ignited by strikes, only to be extinguished by the rain.
The wild elements were slow to abate, but as the day passed, they wandered elsewhere. Once again the
sky was revealed, and the setting sun glowed with brilliance. As beams of light tinted the clouds with
blazing colors, everything gained a sharp contrast: brightly lit on one side, deeply shadowed on the other.
Objects had a unique sense of mass; grass stalks seemed sturdy as marble pillars. Ordinary things took
on an unearthly beauty; Eragon felt as if he were sitting inside a painting.
The rejuvenated earth smelled fresh, clearing their minds and raising their spirits. Saphira stretched,

Page 77

craning her neck, and roared happily. The horses skittered away from her, but Eragon and Brom smiled
at her exuberance.
Before the light faded, they stopped for the night in a shallow depression. Too exhausted to spar, they
went straight to sleep.
REVELATION ATYAZUAC
Although they had managed to partially refill the waterskins during the storm, they drank the last of their
water that morning. “I hope we’re going in the right direction,” said Eragon, crunching up the empty
water bag, “because we’ll be in trouble if we don’t reach Yazuac today.”
Brom did not seem disturbed. “I’ve traveled this way before. Yazuac will be in sight before dusk.”
Eragon laughed doubtfully. “Perhaps you see something I don’t. How can you know that when
everything looks exactly the same for leagues around?”
“Because I am guided not by the land, but by the stars and sun. They will not lead us astray. Come! Let
us be off. It is foolish to conjure up woe where none exists. Yazuac will be there.”
His words proved true. Saphira spotted the village first, but it was not until later in the day that the rest of
them saw it as a dark bump on the horizon. Yazuac was still very far away; it was only visible because of
the plain’s uniform flatness. As they rode closer, a dark winding line appeared on either side of the town
and disappeared in the distance.
“The Ninor River,” said Brom, pointing at it.
Eragon pulled Cadoc to a stop. “Saphira will be seen if she stays with us much longer. Should she hide
while we go into Yazuac?”
Brom scratched his chin and looked at the town. “See that bend in the river? Have her wait there. It’s
far enough from Yazuac so no one should find her, but close enough that she won’t be left behind. We’ll
go through the town, get what we need, and then meet her.”
I don’t like it,said Saphira when Eragon had explained the plan.This is irritating, having to hide all the
time like a criminal.
You know what would happen if we were revealed.She grumbled but gave in and flew away low to the
ground.
They kept a swift pace in anticipation of the food and drink they would soon enjoy. As they approached
the small houses, they could see smoke from a dozen chimneys, but there was no one in the streets. An
abnormal silence enveloped the village. By unspoken consent they stopped before the first house. Eragon
abruptly said, “There aren’t any dogs barking.”
“No.”
“Doesn’t mean anything, though.”
“…No.”

Page 78

Eragon paused. “Someone should have seen us by now.”
“Yes.”
“Then why hasn’t anyone come out?”
Brom squinted at the sun. “Could be afraid.”
“Could be,” said Eragon. He was quiet for a moment. “And if it’s a trap? The Ra’zac might be waiting
for us.”
“We need provisions and water.”
“There’s the Ninor.”
“Still need provisions.”
“True.” Eragon looked around. “So we go in?”
Brom flicked his reins. “Yes, but not like fools. This is the main entrance to Yazuac. If there’s an
ambush, it’ll be along here. No one will expect us to arrive from a different direction.”
“Around to the side, then?” asked Eragon. Brom nodded and pulled out his sword, resting the bare
blade across his saddle. Eragon strung his bow and nocked an arrow.
They trotted quietly around the town and entered it cautiously. The streets were empty, except for a
small fox that darted away as they came near. The houses were dark and foreboding, with shattered
windows. Many of the doors swung on broken hinges. The horses rolled their eyes nervously. Eragon’s
palm tingled, but he resisted the urge to scratch it. As they rode into the center of town, he gripped his
bow tighter, blanching. “Gods above,” he whispered.
A mountain of bodies rose above them, the corpses stiff and grimacing. Their clothes were soaked in
blood, and the churned ground was stained with it. Slaughtered men lay over the women they had tried to
protect, mothers still clasped their children, and lovers who had tried to shield each other rested in
death’s cold embrace. Black arrows stuck out of them all. Neither young nor old had been spared. But
worst of all was the barbed spear that rose out of the peak of the pile, impaling the white body of a baby.
Tears blurred Eragon’s vision and he tried to look away, but the dead faces held his attention. He stared
at their open eyes and wondered how life could have left them so easily.What does our existence mean
when it can end like this? A wave of hopelessness overwhelmed him.
A crow dipped out of the sky, like a black shadow, and perched on the spear. It cocked its head and
greedily scrutinized the infant’s corpse. “Oh no you don’t,” snarled Eragon as he pulled back the
bowstring and released it with a twang. With a puff of feathers, the crow fell over backward, the arrow
protruding from its chest. Eragon fit another arrow to the string, but nausea rose from his stomach and he
threw up over Cadoc’s side.
Brom patted him on the back. When Eragon was done, Brom asked gently, “Do you want to wait for
me outside Yazuac?”
“No… I’ll stay,” said Eragon shakily, wiping his mouth. He avoided looking at the gruesome sight before

Page 79

them. “Who could have done…” He could not force out the words.
Brom bowed his head. “Those who love the pain and suffering of others. They wear many faces and go
by many disguises, but there is only one name for them: evil. There is no understanding it. All we can do
is pity and honor the victims.”
He dismounted Snowfire and walked around, inspecting the trampled ground carefully. “The Ra’zac
passed this way,” he said slowly, “but this wasn’t their doing. This is Urgal work; the spear is of their
make. A company of them came through here, perhaps as many as a hundred. It’s odd; I know of only a
few instances when they have gathered in such…” He knelt and examined a footprint intently. With a
curse he ran back to Snowfire and leapt onto him.
“Ride!” he hissed tightly, spurring Snowfire forward. “There are still Urgals here!” Eragon jammed his
heels into Cadoc. The horse jumped forward and raced after Snowfire. They dashed past the houses and
were almost to the edge of Yazuac when Eragon’s palm tingled again. He saw a flicker of movement to
his right, then a giant fist smashed him out of the saddle. He flew back over Cadoc and crashed into a
wall, holding on to his bow only by instinct. Gasping and stunned, he staggered upright, hugging his side.
An Urgal stood over him, face set in a gross leer. The monster was tall, thick, and broader than a
doorway, with gray skin and yellow piggish eyes. Muscles bulged on his arms and chest, which was
covered by a too small breastplate. An iron cap rested over the pair of ram’s horns curling from his
temples, and a roundshield was bound to one arm. His powerful hand held a short, wicked sword.
Behind him, Eragon saw Brom rein in Snowfire and start back, only to be stopped by the appearance of
a second Urgal, this one with an ax. “Run, you fool!” Brom cried to Eragon, cleaving at his enemy. The
Urgal in front of Eragon roared and swung his sword mightily. Eragon jerked back with a startled yelp as
the weapon whistled past his cheek. He spun around and fled toward the center of Yazuac, heart
pounding wildly.
The Urgal pursued him, heavy boots thudding. Eragon sent a desperate cry for help to Saphira, then
forced himself to go even faster. The Urgal rapidly gained ground despite Eragon’s efforts; large fangs
separated in a soundless bellow. With the Urgal almost upon him, Eragon strung an arrow, spun to a
stop, took aim, and released. The Urgal snapped up his arm and caught the quivering bolt on his shield.
The monster collided with Eragon before he could shoot again, and they fell to the ground in a confused
tangle.
Eragon sprang to his feet and rushed back to Brom, who was trading fierce blows with his opponent
from Snowfire’s back.Where are the rest of the Urgals? wondered Eragon frantically.Are these two the
only ones in Yazuac? There was a loud smack, and Snowfire reared, whinnying. Brom doubled over in
his saddle, blood streaming down his arm. The Urgal beside him howled in triumph and raised his ax for
the death blow.
A deafening scream tore out of Eragon as he charged the Urgal, headfirst. The Urgal paused in
astonishment, then faced him contemptuously, swinging his ax. Eragon ducked under the two-handed
blow and clawed the Urgal’s side, leaving bloody furrows. The Urgal’s face twisted with rage. He
slashed again, but missed as Eragon dived to the side and scrambled down an alley.
Eragon concentrated on leading the Urgals away from Brom. He slipped into a narrow passageway
between two houses, saw it was a dead end, and slid to a stop. He tried to back out, but the Urgals had
already blocked the entrance. They advanced, cursing him in their gravelly voices. Eragon swung his head
from side to side, searching for a way out, but there was none.

Page 80

As he faced the Urgals, images flashed in his mind: dead villagers piled around the spear and an innocent
baby who would never grow to adulthood. At the thought of their fate, a burning, fiery power gathered
from every part of his body. It was more than a desire for justice. It was his entire being rebelling against
the fact of death—that he would cease to exist. The power grew stronger and stronger until he felt ready
to burst from the contained force.
He stood tall and straight, all fear gone. He raised his bow smoothly. The Urgals laughed and lifted their
shields. Eragon sighted down the shaft, as he had done hundreds of times, and aligned the arrowhead
with his target. The energy inside him burned at an unbearable level. He had to release it, or it would
consume him. A word suddenly leapt unbidden to his lips. He shot, yelling, “Brisingr!”
The arrow hissed through the air, glowing with a crackling blue light. It struck the lead Urgal on the
forehead, and the air resounded with an explosion. A blue shock wave blasted out of the monster’s head,
killing the other Urgal instantly. It reached Eragon before he had time to react, and it passed through him
without harm, dissipating against the houses.
Eragon stood panting, then looked at his icy palm. The gedwëy ignasia was glowing like white-hot metal,
yet even as he watched, it faded back to normal. He clenched his fist, then a wave of exhaustion washed
over him. He felt strange and feeble, as if he had not eaten for days. His knees buckled, and he sagged
against a wall.
ADMONISHMENTS
Once a modicum of strength returned to him, Eragon staggered out of the alley, skirting the dead
monsters. He did not get far before Cadoc trotted to his side. “Good, you weren’t hurt,” mumbled
Eragon. He noticed, without particularly caring, that his hands were shaking violently and his movements
were jerky. He felt detached, as if everything he saw were happening to someone else.
Eragon found Snowfire, nostrils flared and ears flat against his head, prancing by the corner of a house,
ready to bolt. Brom was still slumped motionless in the saddle. Eragon reached out with his mind and
soothed the horse. Once Snowfire relaxed, Eragon went to Brom.
There was a long, blood-soaked cut on the old man’s right arm. The wound bled profusely, but it was
neither deep nor wide. Still, Eragon knew it had to be bound before Brom lost too much blood. He
stroked Snowfire for a moment, then slid Brom out of the saddle. The weight proved too much for him,
and Brom dropped heavily to the ground. Eragon was shocked by his own weakness.
A scream of rage filled his head. Saphira dived out of the sky and landed fiercely in front of him, keeping
her wings half raised. She hissed angrily, eyes burning. Her tail lashed, and Eragon winced as it snapped
overhead.Are you hurt? she asked, rage boiling in her voice.
“No,” he assured her as he laid Brom on his back.
She growled and exclaimed,Where are the ones who did this? I will tear them apart!
He wearily pointed in the direction of the alley. “It’ll do no good; they’re already dead.”
You killed them?Saphira sounded surprised.
He nodded. “Somehow.” With a few terse words, he told her what had happened while he searched his

Page 81

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

saddlebags for the rags in which Zar’roc had been wrapped.
Saphira said gravely,You have grown.
Eragon grunted. He found a long rag and carefully rolled back Brom’s sleeve. With a few deft strokes
he cleaned the cut and bandaged it tightly.I wish we were still in Palancar Valley, he said to Saphira.
There, at least, I knew what plants were good for healing. Here, I don’t have any idea what will help him.
He retrieved Brom’s sword from the ground, wiped it, then returned it to the sheath on Brom’s belt.
We should leave,said Saphira.There may be more Urgals lurking about.
Can you carry Brom? Your saddle will hold him in place, and you can protect him.
Yes, but I’m not leaving you alone.
Fine, fly next to me, but let’s get out of here.He tied the saddle onto Saphira, then put his arms around
Brom and tried to lift him, but again his diminished strength failed him.Saphira—help.
She snaked her head past him and caught the back of Brom’s robe between her teeth. Arching her
neck, she lifted the old man off the ground, like a cat would a kitten, and deposited him onto her back.
Then Eragon slipped Brom’s legs through the saddle’s straps and tightened them. He looked up when the
old man moaned and shifted.
Brom blinked blearily, putting a hand to his head. He gazed down at Eragon with concern. “Did Saphira
get here in time?”
Eragon shook his head. “I’ll explain it later. Your arm is injured. I bandaged it as best I could, but you
need a safe place to rest.”
“Yes,” said Brom, gingerly touching his arm. “Do you know where my sword… Ah, I see you found it.”
Eragon finished tightening the straps. “Saphira’s going to take you and follow me by air.”
“Are you sure you want me to ride her?” asked Brom. “I can ride Snowfire.”
“Not with that arm. This way, even if you faint, you won’t fall off.”
Brom nodded. “I’m honored.” He wrapped his good arm around Saphira’s neck, and she took off in a
flurry, springing high into the sky. Eragon backed away, buffeted by the eddies from her wings, and
returned to the horses.
He tied Snowfire behind Cadoc, then left Yazuac, returning to the trail and following it southward. It led
through a rocky area, veered left, and continued along the bank of the Ninor River. Ferns, mosses, and
small bushes dotted the side of the path. It was refreshingly cool under the trees, but Eragon did not let
the soothing air lull him into a sense of security. He stopped briefly to fill the waterskins and let the horses
drink. Glancing down, he saw the Ra’zac’s spoor.At least we’re going in the right direction. Saphira
circled overhead, keeping a keen eye on him.
It disturbed him that they had seen only two Urgals. The villagers had been killed and Yazuac ransacked
by a large horde, yet where was it?Perhaps the ones we encountered were a rear guard or a trap left for
anyone who was following the main force.

Page 82

His thoughts turned to how he had killed the Urgals. An idea, a revelation, slowly wormed its way
through his mind. He, Eragon—farm boy of Palancar Valley—had used magic.Magic! It was the only
word for what had happened. It seemed impossible, but he could not deny what he had seen.Somehow
I’ve become a sorcerer or wizard! But he did not know how to use this new power again or what its
limits and dangers might be.How can I have this ability? Was it common among the Riders? And if Brom
knew of it, why didn’t he tell me? He shook his head in wonder and bewilderment.
He conversed with Saphira to check on Brom’s condition and to share his thoughts. She was just as
puzzled as he was about the magic.Saphira, can you find us a place to stay? I can’t see very far down
here. While she searched, he continued along the Ninor.
The summons reached him just as the light was fading.Come. Saphira sent him an image of a secluded
clearing in the trees by the river. Eragon turned the horses in the new direction and nudged them into a
trot. With Saphira’s help it was easy to find, but it was so well hidden that he doubted anyone else would
notice it.
A small, smokeless fire was already burning when he entered the clearing. Brom sat next to it, tending his
arm, which he held at an awkward angle. Saphira was crouched beside him, her body tense. She looked
intently at Eragon and asked,Are you sure you aren’t hurt?
Not on the outside… but I’m not sure about the rest of me.
I should have been there sooner.
Don’t feel bad. We all made mistakes today. Mine was not staying closer to you.Her gratitude for that
remark washed over him. He looked at Brom. “How are you?”
The old man glanced at his arm. “It’s a large scratch and hurts terribly, but it should heal quickly enough.
I need a fresh bandage; this one didn’t last as long as I’d hoped.” They boiled water to wash Brom’s
wound. Then Brom tied a fresh rag to his arm and said, “I must eat, and you look hungry as well. Let’s
have dinner first, then talk.”
When their bellies were full and warm, Brom lit his pipe. “Now, I think it’s time for you to tell me what
transpired while I was unconscious. I am most curious.” His face reflected the flickering firelight, and his
bushy eyebrows stuck out fiercely.
Eragon nervously clasped his hands and told the story without embellishment. Brom remained silent
throughout it, his face inscrutable. When Eragon finished, Brom looked down at the ground. For a long
time the only sound was the snapping fire. Brom finally stirred. “Have you used this power before?”
“No. Do you know anything about it?”
“A little.” Brom’s face was thoughtful. “It seems I owe you a debt for saving my life. I hope I can return
the favor someday. You should be proud; few escape unscathed from slaying their first Urgal. But the
manner in which you did it was very dangerous. You could have destroyed yourself and the whole town.”
“It wasn’t as if I had a choice,” said Eragon defensively. “The Urgals were almost upon me. If I had
waited, they would have chopped me into pieces!”
Brom stamped his teeth vigorously on the pipe stem. “You didn’t have any idea what you were doing.”

“Then tell me,” challenged Eragon. “I’ve been searching for answers to this mystery, but I can’t make
sense of it. What happened? How could I have possibly used magic? No one has ever instructed me in it
or taught me spells.”
Brom’s eyes flashed. “This isn’t something you should be taught—much less use!”
“Well, Ihave used it, and I may need it to fight again. But I won’t be able to if you don’t help me. What’s
wrong? Is there some secret I’m not supposed to learn until I’m old and wise? Or maybe you don’t
know anything about magic!”
“Boy!” roared Brom. “You demand answers with an insolence rarely seen. If you knew what you asked
for, you would not be so quick to inquire. Do not try me.” He paused, then relaxed into a kinder
countenance. “The knowledge you ask for is more complex than you understand.”
Eragon rose hotly in protest. “I feel as though I’ve been thrust into a world with strange rules that no one
will explain.”
“I understand,” said Brom. He fiddled with a piece of grass. “It’s late and we should sleep, but I will tell
you a few things now, to stop your badgering. This magic—for it is magic—has rules like the rest of the
world. If you break the rules, the penalty is death, without exception. Your deeds are limited by your
strength, the words you know, and your imagination.”
“What do you mean by words?” asked Eragon.
“More questions!” cried Brom. “For a moment I had hoped you were empty of them. But you are quite
right in asking. When you shot the Urgals, didn’t you say something?”
“Yes,brisingr. ” The fire flared, and a shiver ran through Eragon. Something about the word made him
feel incredibly alive.
“I thought so.Brisingr is from an ancient language that all living things used to speak. However, it was
forgotten over time and went unspoken for eons in Alagaësia, until the elves brought it back over the sea.
They taught it to the other races, who used it for making and doing powerful things. The language has a
name for everything, if you can find it.”
“But what does that have to do with magic?” interrupted Eragon.
“Everything! It is the basis for all power. The language describes the true nature of things, not the
superficial aspects that everyone sees. For example, fire is calledbrisingr . Not only is thata name for fire,
it isthe name for fire. If you are strong enough, you can usebrisingr to direct fire to do whatever you will.
And that is what happened today.”
Eragon thought about it for a moment. “Why was the fire blue? How come it did exactly what I wanted,
if all I said wasfire ?”
“The color varies from person to person. It depends on who says the word. As to why the fire did what
you wanted, that’s a matter of practice. Most beginners have to spell out exactly what they want to
happen. As they gain more experience, it isn’t as necessary. A true master could just saywater and create
something totally unrelated, like a gemstone. You wouldn’t be able to understand how he had done it, but
the master would have seen the connection betweenwater and the gem and would have used that as the

Page 84

focal point for his power. The practice is more of an art than anything else. What you did was extremely
difficult.”
Saphira interrupted Eragon’s thoughts.Brom is a magician! That’s how he was able to light the fire on the
plains. He doesn’t just know about magic; he can use it himself!
Eragon’s eyes widened.You’re right!
Ask him about this power, but be careful of what you say. It is unwise to trifle with those who have such
abilities. If he is a wizard or sorcerer, who knows what his motives might have been for settling in
Carvahall?
Eragon kept that in mind as he said carefully, “Saphira and I just realized something. You can use this
magic, can’t you? That’s how you started the fire our first day on the plains.”
Brom inclined his head slightly. “I am proficient to some degree.”
“Then why didn’t you fight the Urgals with it? In fact, I can think of many times when it would have been
useful—you could have shielded us from the storm and kept the dirt out of our eyes.”
After refilling his pipe, Brom said, “Some simple reasons, really. I am not a Rider, which means that,
even at your weakest moment, you are stronger than I. And I have outlived my youth; I’m not as strong
as I used to be. Every time I reach for magic, it gets a little harder.”
Eragon dropped his eyes, abashed. “I’m sorry.”
“Don’t be,” said Brom as he shifted his arm. “It happens to everyone.”
“Where did you learn to use magic?”
“That is one fact I’ll keep to myself… Suffice it to say, it was in a remote area and from a very good
teacher. I can, at the very least, pass on his lessons.” Brom snuffed his pipe with a small rock. “I know
that you have more questions, and I will answer them, but they must wait until morning.”
He leaned forward, eyes gleaming. “Until then, I will say this to discourage any experiments: magic takes
just as much energy as if you used your arms and back. That is why you felt tired after destroying the
Urgals. And that is why I was angry. It was a dreadful risk on your part. If the magic had used more
energy than was in your body, it would have killed you. You should use magic only for tasks that can’t be
accomplished the mundane way.”
“How do you know if a spell will use all your energy?” asked Eragon, frightened.
Brom raised his hands. “Most of the time you don’t. That’s why magicians have to know their limits well,
and even then they are cautious. Once you commit to a task and release the magic, you can’t pull it back,
even if it’s going to kill you. I mean this as a warning: don’t try anything until you’ve learned more. Now,
enough of this for tonight.”
As they spread out their blankets, Saphira commented with satisfaction,We are becoming more
powerful, Eragon, both of us. Soon no one will be able to stand in our way.
Yes, but which way shall we choose?

Page 85

Whichever one we want,she said smugly, settling down for the night.
MAGIC IS THESIMPLESTTHING
“Why do you think those two Urgals were still in Yazuac?” asked Eragon, after they had been on the
trail for a while. “There doesn’t seem to be any reason for them to have stayed behind.”
“I suspect they deserted the main group to loot the town. What makes it odd is that, as far as I know,
Urgals have gathered in force only two or three times in history. It’s unsettling that they are doing it now.”
“Do you think the Ra’zac caused the attack?”
“I don’t know. The best thing we can do is continue away from Yazuac at the fastest pace we can
muster. Besides, this is the direction the Ra’zac went: south.”
Eragon agreed. “We still need provisions, however. Is there another town nearby?”
Brom shook his head. “No, but Saphira can hunt for us if we must survive on meat alone. This swath of
trees may look small to you, but there are plenty of animals in it. The river is the only source of water for
many miles around, so most of the plains animals come here to drink. We won’t starve.”
Eragon remained quiet, satisfied with Brom’s answer. As they rode, loud birds darted around them, and
the river rushed by peacefully. It was a noisy place, full of life and energy. Eragon asked, “How did that
Urgal get you? Things were happening so fast, I didn’t see.”
“Bad luck, really,” grumbled Brom. “I was more than a match for him, so he kicked Snowfire. The idiot
of a horse reared and threw me off balance. That was all the Urgal needed to give me this gash.” He
scratched his chin. “I suppose you’re still wondering about this magic. The fact that you’ve discovered it
presents a thorny problem. Few know it, but every Rider could use magic, though with differing
strengths. They kept the ability secret, even at the height of their power, because it gave them an
advantage over their enemies. Had everyone known about it, dealing with common people would have
been difficult. Many think the king’s magical powers come from the fact that he is a wizard or sorcerer.
That’s not true; it is because he’s a Rider.”
“What’s the difference? Doesn’t the fact that I used magic make me a sorcerer?”
“Not at all! A sorcerer, like a Shade, uses spirits to accomplish his will. That is totally different from your
power. Nor does that make you a magician, whose powers come without the aid of spirits or a dragon.
And you’re certainly not a witch or wizard, who get their powers from various potions and spells.
“Which brings me back to my original point: the problem you’ve presented. Young Riders like yourself
were put through a strict regimen designed to strengthen their bodies and increase their mental control.
This regimen continued for many months, occasionally years, until the Riders were deemed responsible
enough to handle magic. Up until then, not one student was told of his potential powers. If one of them
discovered magic by accident, he or she was immediately taken away for private tutoring. It was rare for
anyone to discover magic on his own,” he inclined his head toward Eragon, “though they were never put
under the same pressure you were.”
“Then how were they finally trained to use magic?” asked Eragon. “I don’t see how you could teach it to
anyone. If you had tried to explain it to me two days ago, it wouldn’t have made any sense.”

Page 86

“The students were presented with a series of pointless exercises designed to frustrate them. For
example, they were instructed to move piles of stones using only their feet, fill ever draining tubs full of
water, and other impossibilities. After a time, they would get infuriated enough to use magic. Most of the
time it succeeded.
“What this means,” Brom continued, “is that you will be disadvantaged if you ever meet an enemy who
has received this training. There are still some alive who are that old: the king for one, not to mention the
elves. Any one of those could tear you apart with ease.”
“What can I do, then?”
“There isn’t time for formal instruction, but we can do much while we travel,” said Brom. “I know many
techniques you can practice that will give you strength and control, but you cannot gain the discipline the
Riders had overnight. You,” he looked at Eragon humorously, “will have to amass it on the run. It will be
hard in the beginning, but the rewards will be great. It may please you to know that no Rider your age
ever used magic the way you did yesterday with those two Urgals.”
Eragon smiled at the praise. “Thank you. Does this language have a name?”
Brom laughed. “Yes, but no one knows it. It would be a word of incredible power, something by which
you could control the entire language and those who use it. People have long searched for it, but no one
has ever found it.”
“I still don’t understand how this magic works,” said Eragon. “Exactly how do I use it?”
Brom looked astonished. “I haven’t made that clear?”
“No.”
Brom took a deep breath and said, “To work with magic, you must have a certain innate power, which
is very rare among people nowadays. You also have to be able to summon this power at will. Once it is
called upon, you have to use it or let it fade away. Understood? Now, if you wish to employ the power,
you must utter the word or phrase of the ancient language that describes your intent. For example, if you
hadn’t saidbrisingr yesterday, nothing would have happened.”
“So I’m limited by my knowledge of this language?”
“Exactly,” crowed Brom. “Also, while speaking it, it’s impossible to practice deceit.”
Eragon shook his head. “That can’t be. People always lie. The sounds of the ancient words can’t stop
them from doing that.”
Brom cocked an eyebrow and said, “Fethrblaka, eka weohnata néiat haina ono. Blaka eom iet lam.” A
bird suddenly flitted from a branch and landed on his hand. It trilled lightly and looked at them with beady
eyes. After a moment he said, “Eitha,” and it fluttered away.
“How did you do that?” asked Eragon in wonder.
“I promised not to harm him. He may not have known exactly what I meant, but in the language of
power, the meaning of my words was evident. The bird trusted me because he knows what all animals

Page 87

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

do, that those who speak in that tongue are bound by their word.”
“And the elves speak this language?”
“Yes.”
“So they never lie?”
“Not quite,” admitted Brom. “They maintain that they don’t, and in a way it’s true, but they have
perfected the art of saying one thing and meaning another. You never know exactly what their intent is, or
if you have fathomed it correctly. Many times they only reveal part of the truth and withhold the rest. It
takes a refined and subtle mind to deal with their culture.”
Eragon considered that. “What do personal names mean in this language? Do they give power over
people?”
Brom’s eyes brightened with approval. “Yes, they do. Those who speak the language have two names.
The first is for everyday use and has little authority. But the second is their true name and is shared with
only a few trusted people. There was a time when no one concealed his true name, but this age isn’t as
kind. Whoever knows your true name gains enormous power over you. It’s like putting your life into
another person’s hands. Everyone has a hidden name, but few know what it is.”
“How do you find your true name?” asked Eragon.
“Elves instinctively know theirs. No one else has that gift. The human Riders usually went on quests to
discover it—or found an elf who would tell them, which was rare, for elves don’t distribute that
knowledge freely,” replied Brom.
“I’d like to know mine,” Eragon said wistfully.
Brom’s brow darkened. “Be careful. It can be a terrible knowledge. To know who you are without any
delusions or sympathy is a moment of revelation that no one experiences unscathed. Some have been
driven to madness by that stark reality. Most try to forget it. But as much as the name will give others
power, so you may gain power over yourself, if the truth doesn’t break you.”
And I’m sure that it would not,stated Saphira.
“I still wish to know,” said Eragon, determined.
“You are not easily dissuaded. That is good, for only the resolute find their identity, but I cannot help you
with this. It is a search that you will have to undertake on your own.” Brom moved his injured arm and
grimaced uncomfortably.
“Why can’t you or I heal that with magic?” asked Eragon.
Brom blinked. “No reason—I just never considered it because it’s beyond my strength. You could
probably do it with the right word, but I don’t want you to exhaust yourself.”
“I could save you a lot of trouble and pain,” protested Eragon.
“I’ll live with it,” said Brom flatly. “Using magic to heal a wound takes just as much energy as it would to

Page 88

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

mend on its own. I don’t want you tired for the next few days. You shouldn’t attempt such a difficult task
yet.”
“Still, if it’s possible to fix your arm, could I bring someone back from the dead?”
The question surprised Brom, but he answered quickly, “Remember what I said about projects that will
kill you? That is one of them. Riders were forbidden to try to resurrect the dead, for their own safety.
There is an abyss beyond life where magic means nothing. If you reach into it, your strength will flee and
your soul will fade into darkness. Wizards, sorcerers, and Riders—all have failed and died on that
threshold. Stick with what’s possible—cuts, bruises, maybe some broken bones—but definitely not dead
people.”
Eragon frowned. “This is a lot more complex than I thought.”
“Exactly!” said Brom. “And if you don’t understand what you’re doing, you’ll try something too big and
die.” He twisted in his saddle and swooped down, grabbing a handful of pebbles from the ground. With
effort, he righted himself, then discarded all but one of the rocks. “See this pebble?”
“Yes.”
“Take it.” Eragon did and stared at the unremarkable lump. It was dull black, smooth, and as large as
the end of his thumb. There were countless stones like it on the trail. “This is your training.”
Eragon looked back at him, confused. “I don’t understand.”
“Of course you don’t,” said Brom impatiently. “That’s why I’m teaching you and not the other way
around. Now stop talking or we’ll never get anywhere. What I want you to do is lift the rock off your
palm and hold it in the air for as long as you can. The words you’re going to use arestenr reisa.Say
them.”
“Stenr reisa.”
“Good. Go ahead and try.”
Eragon focused sourly on the pebble, searching his mind for any hint of the energy that had burned in him
the day before. The stone remained motionless as he stared at it, sweating and frustrated.How am I
supposed to do this? Finally, he crossed his arms and snapped, “This is impossible.”
“No,” said Brom gruffly. “I’llsay when it’s impossible or not. Fight for it! Don’t give in this easily. Try
again.”
Frowning, Eragon closed his eyes, setting aside all distracting thoughts. He took a deep breath and
reached into the farthest corners of his consciousness, trying to find where his power resided. Searching,
he found only thoughts and memories until he felt something different—a small bump that was a part of
him and yet not of him. Excited, he dug into it, seeking what it hid. He felt resistance, a barrier in his mind,
but knew that the power lay on the other side. He tried to breach it, but it held firm before his efforts.
Growing angry, Eragon drove into the barrier, ramming against it with all of his might until it shattered like
a thin pane of glass, flooding his mind with a river of light.
“Stenr reisa,” he gasped. The pebble wobbled into the air over his faintly glowing palm. He struggled to
keep it floating, but the power slipped away and faded back behind the barrier. The pebble dropped to

Page 89

his hand with a soft plop, and his palm returned to normal. He felt a little tired, but grinned from his
success.
“Not bad for your first time,” said Brom.
“Why does my hand do that? It’s like a little lantern.”
“No one’s sure,” Brom admitted. “The Riders always preferred to channel their power through
whichever hand bore the gedwëy ignasia. You can use your other palm, but it isn’t as easy.” He looked
at Eragon for a minute. “I’ll buy you some gloves at the next town, if it isn’t gutted. You hide the mark
pretty well on your own, but we don’t want anyone to see it by accident. Besides, there may be times
when you won’t want the glow to alert an enemy.”
“Do you have a mark of your own?”
“No. Only Riders have them,” said Brom. “Also, you should know that magic is affected by distance,
just like an arrow or a spear. If you try to lift or move something a mile away, it’ll take more energy than
if you were closer. So if you see enemies racing after you from a league away, let them approach before
using magic. Now, back to work! Try to lift the pebble again.”
“Again?” asked Eragon weakly, thinking of the effort it had taken to do it just once.
“Yes! And this time be quicker about it.”
They continued with the exercises throughout most of the day. When Eragon finally stopped, he was
tired and ill-tempered. In those hours, he had come to hate the pebble and everything about it. He started
to throw it away, but Brom said, “Don’t. Keep it.” Eragon glared at him, then reluctantly tucked the
stone into a pocket.
“We’re not done yet,” warned Brom, “so don’t get comfortable.” He pointed at a small plant. “This is
calleddelois .” From there on he instructed Eragon in the ancient language, giving him words to memorize,
fromvöndr, a thin, straight stick, to the morning star,Aiedail .
That evening they sparred around the fire. Though Brom fought with his left hand, his skill was
undiminished.

The days followed the same pattern. First, Eragon struggled to learn the ancient words and to manipulate
the pebble. Then, in the evening, he trained against Brom with the fake swords. Eragon was in constant
discomfort, but he gradually began to change, almost without noticing. Soon the pebble no longer
wobbled when he lifted it. He mastered the first exercises Brom gave him and undertook harder ones,
and his knowledge of the ancient language grew.
In their sparring, Eragon gained confidence and speed, striking like a snake. His blows became heavier,
and his arm no longer trembled when he warded off attacks. The clashes lasted longer as he learned how
to fend off Brom. Now, when they went to sleep, Eragon was not the only one with bruises.
Saphira continued to grow as well, but more slowly than before. Her extended flights, along with
periodic hunts, kept her fit and healthy. She was taller than the horses now, and much longer. Because of
her size and the way her scales sparkled, she was altogether too visible. Brom and Eragon worried about

Page 90

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

it, but they could not convince her to allow dirt to obscure her scintillating hide.
They continued south, tracking the Ra’zac. It frustrated Eragon that no matter how fast they went, the
Ra’zac always stayed a few days ahead of them. At times he was ready to give up, but then they would
find some mark or print that would renew his hope.
There were no signs of habitation along the Ninor or in the plains, leaving the three companions
undisturbed as the days slipped by. Finally, they neared Daret, the first village since Yazuac.

The night before they reached the village, Eragon’s dreams were especially vivid.
He saw Garrow and Roran at home, sitting in the destroyed kitchen. They asked him for help rebuilding
the farm, but he only shook his head with a pang of longing in his heart. “I’m tracking your killers,” he
whispered to his uncle.
Garrow looked at him askance and demanded, “Do I look dead to you?”
“I can’t help you,” said Eragon softly, feeling tears in his eyes.
There was a sudden roar, and Garrow transformed into the Ra’zac. “Then die,” they hissed, and leapt at
Eragon.
He woke up feeling ill and watched the stars slowly turn in the sky.
All will be well, little one,said Saphira gently.
DARET
Daret was on the banks of the Ninor River—as it had to be to survive. The village was small and
wild-looking, without any signs of inhabitants. Eragon and Brom approached it with great caution.
Saphira hid close to the town this time; if trouble arose, she would be at their sides within seconds.
They rode into Daret, striving to be silent. Brom gripped his sword with his good hand, eyes flashing
everywhere. Eragon kept his bow partially drawn as they passed between the silent houses, glancing at
each other with apprehension.This doesn’t look good, commented Eragon to Saphira. She did not
answer, but he felt her prepare to rush after them. He looked at the ground and was reassured to see the
fresh footprints of children.But where are they?
Brom stiffened as they entered the center of Daret and found it empty. Wind blew through the desolate
town, and dust devils swirled sporadically. Brom wheeled Snowfire about. “Let’s get out of here. I don’t
like the feel of this.” He spurred Snowfire into a gallop. Eragon followed him, urging Cadoc onward.
They advanced only a few strides before wagons toppled out from behind the houses and blocked their
way. Cadoc snorted and dug in his hooves, sliding to a stop next to Snowfire. A swarthy man hopped
over the wagon and planted himself before them, a broadsword slung at his side and a drawn bow in his
hands. Eragon swung his own bow up and pointed it at the stranger, who commanded, “Halt! Put your
weapons down. You’re surrounded by sixty archers. They’ll shoot if you move.” As if on cue, a row of
men stood up on the roofs of the surrounding houses.

Page 91

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Stay away, Saphira!cried Eragon.There are too many. If you come, they’ll shoot you out of the sky.
Stay away! She heard, but he was unsure if she would obey. He prepared to use magic.I’ll have to stop
the arrows before they hit me or Brom.
“What do you want?” asked Brom calmly.
“Why have you come here?” demanded the man.
“To buy supplies and hear the news. Nothing more. We’re on the way to my cousin’s house in
Dras-Leona.”
“You’re armed pretty heavily.”
“So are you,” said Brom. “These are dangerous times.”
“True.” The man looked at them carefully. “I don’t think you mean us ill, but we’ve had too many
encounters with Urgals and bandits for me to trust you only on your word.”
“If it doesn’t matter what we say, what happens now?” countered Brom. The men on top of the houses
had not moved. By their very stillness, Eragon was sure that they were either highly disciplined… or
frightened for their lives. He hoped it was the latter.
“You say that you only want supplies. Would you agree to stay here while we bring what you need, then
pay us and leave immediately?”
“Yes.”
“All right,” said the man, lowering his bow, though he kept it ready. He waved at one of the archers,
who slid to the ground and ran over. “Tell him what you want.”
Brom recited a short list and then added, “Also, if you have a spare pair of gloves that would fit my
nephew, I’d like to buy those too.” The archer nodded and ran off.
“The name’s Trevor,” said the man standing in front of them. “Normally I’d shake your hand, but under
the circumstances, I think I’ll keep my distance. Tell me, where are you from?”
“North,” said Brom, “but we haven’t lived in any place long enough to call it home. Have Urgals forced
you to take these measures?”
“Yes,” said Trevor, “and worse fiends. Do you have any news from other towns? We receive word
from them rarely, but there have been reports that they are also beleaguered.”
Brom turned grave. “I wish it wasn’t our lot to bring you these tidings. Nearly a fortnight ago we passed
through Yazuac and found it pillaged. The villagers had been slaughtered and piled together. We would
have tried to give them a decent burial, but two Urgals attacked us.”
Shocked, Trevor stepped back and looked down with tears in his eyes. “Alas, this is indeed a dark day.
Still, I don’t see how two Urgals could have defeated all of Yazuac. The people there were good
fighters—some were my friends.”
“There were signs that a band of Urgals had ravaged the town,” stated Brom. “I think the ones we

Page 92

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

encountered were deserters.”
“How large was the company?”
Brom fiddled with his saddlebags for a minute. “Large enough to wipe out Yazuac, but small enough to
go unnoticed in the countryside. No more than a hundred, and no less than fifty. If I’m not mistaken,
either number would prove fatal to you.” Trevor wearily agreed. “You should consider leaving,” Brom
continued. “This area has become far too perilous for anyone to live in peace.”
“I know, but the people here refuse to consider moving. This is their home—as well as mine, though I
have only been here a couple years—and they place its worth above their own lives.” Trevor looked at
him seriously. “We have repulsed individual Urgals, and that has given the townspeople a confidence far
beyond their abilities. I fear that we will all wake up one morning with our throats slashed.”
The archer hurried out of a house with a pile of goods in his arms. He set them next to the horses, and
Brom paid him. As the man left, Brom asked, “Why did they choose you to defend Daret?”
Trevor shrugged. “I was in the king’s army for some years.”
Brom dug through the items, handed Eragon the pair of gloves, and packed the rest of the supplies into
their saddlebags. Eragon pulled the gloves on, being careful to keep his palm facing down, and flexed his
hands. The leather felt good and strong, though it was scarred from use. “Well,” said Brom, “as I
promised, we will go now.”
Trevor nodded. “When you enter Dras-Leona, would you do us this favor? Alert the Empire to our
plight and that of the other towns. If word of this hasn’t reached the king by now, it’s cause for worry.
And if it has, but he has chosen to do nothing, that too is cause for worry.”
“We will carry your message. May your swords stay sharp,” said Brom.
“And yours.”
The wagons were pulled out of their way, and they rode from Daret into the trees along the Ninor River.
Eragon sent his thoughts to Saphira.We’re on our way back. Everything turned out all right. Her only
response was simmering anger.
Brom pulled at his beard. “The Empire is in worse condition than I had imagined. When the traders
visited Carvahall, they brought reports of unrest, but I never believed that it was this widespread. With all
these Urgals around, it seems that the Empire itself is under attack, yet no troops or soldiers have been
sent out. It’s as if the king doesn’t care to defend his domain.”
“It is strange,” agreed Eragon.
Brom ducked under a low-hanging branch. “Did you use any of your powers while we were in Daret?”
“There was no reason to.”
“Wrong,” corrected Brom. “You could have sensed Trevor’s intentions. Even with my limited abilities, I
was able to do that. If the villagers had been bent on killing us, I wouldn’t have just sat there. However, I
felt there was a reasonable chance of talking our way out of there, which is what I did.”

“How could I know what Trevor was thinking?” asked Eragon. “Am I supposed to be able to see into
people’s minds?”
“Come now,” chided Brom, “you should know the answer to that. You could have discovered Trevor’s
purpose in the same way that you communicate with Cadoc or Saphira. The minds of men are not so
different from a dragon’s or horse’s. It’s a simple thing to do, but it’s a power you must use sparingly and
with great caution. A person’s mind is his last sanctuary. You must never violate it unless circumstances
force you to. The Riders had very strict rules regarding this. If they were broken without due cause, the
punishment was severe.”
“And you can do this even though you aren’t a Rider?” asked Eragon.
“As I said before, with the right instruction anyone can talk with their minds, but with differing amounts of
success. Whether it’s magic, though, is hard to tell. Magical abilities will certainly trigger the talent—or
becoming linked with a dragon—but I’ve known plenty who learned it on their own. Think about it: you
can communicate with any sentient being, though the contact may not be very clear. You could spend the
entire day listening to a bird’s thoughts or understanding how an earthworm feels during a rainstorm. But
I’ve never found birds very interesting. I suggest starting with a cat; they have unusual personalities.”
Eragon twisted Cadoc’s reins in his hands, considering the implications of what Brom had said. “But if I
can get into someone’s head, doesn’t that mean that others can do the same to me? How do I know if
someone’s prying in my mind? Is there a way to stop that?”How do I know if Brom can tell what I’m
thinking right now?
“Why, yes. Hasn’t Saphira ever blocked you from her mind?”
“Occasionally,” admitted Eragon. “When she took me into the Spine, I couldn’t talk to her at all. It
wasn’t that she was ignoring me; I don’t think she could even hear me. There were walls around her mind
that I couldn’t get through.”
Brom worked on his bandage for a moment, shifting it higher on his arm. “Only a few people can tell if
someone is in their mind, and of those, only a handful could stop you from entering. It’s a matter of
training and of how you think. Because of your magical power, you’ll always know if someone is in your
mind. Once you do, blocking them is a simple matter of concentrating on one thing to the exclusion of all
else. For instance, if you only think about a brick wall, that’s all the enemy will find in your mind.
However, it takes a huge amount of energy and discipline to block someone for any length of time. If
you’re distracted by even the slightest thing, your wall will waver and your opponent will slip in through
the weakness.”
“How can I learn to do this?” asked Eragon.
“There is only one thing for it: practice, practice, and yet more practice. Picture something in your mind
and hold it there to the exclusion of all else for as long as you can. It is a very advanced ability; only a
handful ever master it,” said Brom.
“I don’t need perfection, just safety.”If I can get into someone’s mind, can I change how he thinks?
Every time I learn something new about magic, I grow more wary of it.
When they reached Saphira, she startled them by thrusting her head at them. The horses backstepped
nervously. Saphira looked Eragon over carefully and gave a low hiss. Her eyes were flinty. Eragon threw
a concerned look at Brom—he had never seen Saphira this angry—then asked,What’s wrong?

Page 94

You,she growled.You are the problem.
Eragon frowned and got off Cadoc. As soon as his feet touched the ground, Saphira swept his legs out
from under him with her tail and pinned him with her talons. “What are you doing?” he yelled, struggling
to get up, but she was too strong for him. Brom watched attentively from Snowfire.
Saphira swung her head over Eragon until they were eye to eye. He squirmed under her unwavering
glare.You! Every time you leave my sight you get into trouble. You’re like a new hatchling, sticking your
nose into everything. And what happens when you stick it into something that bites back? How will you
survive then? I cannot help you when I’m miles away. I’ve stayed hidden so that no one would see me,
but no longer! Not when it may cost you your life.
I can understand why you’re upset,said Eragon,but I’m much older than you and can take care of
myself. If anything, you’re the one who needs to be protected.
She snarled and snapped her teeth by his ear.Do you really believe that? she asked.Tomorrow you will
ride me—not that pitiful deer-animal you call a horse—or else I will carry you in my claws. Are you a
Dragon Rider or not? Don’t you care for me?
The question burned in Eragon, and he dropped his gaze. He knew she was right, but he was scared of
riding her. Their flights had been the most painful ordeal he had ever endured.
“Well?” demanded Brom.
“She wants me to ride her tomorrow,” said Eragon lamely.
Brom considered it with twinkling eyes. “Well, you have the saddle. I suppose that if the two of you stay
out of sight, it won’t be a problem.” Saphira switched her gaze to him, then returned it to Eragon.
“But what if you’re attacked or there’s an accident? I won’t be able to get there in time and—”
Saphira pressed harder on his chest, stopping his words.Exactly my point, little one.
Brom seemed to hide a smile. “It’s worth the risk. You need to learn how to ride her anyway. Think
about it this way: with you flying ahead and looking at the ground, you’ll be able to spot any traps,
ambushes, or other unwelcome surprises.”
Eragon looked back at Saphira and said,Okay, I’ll do it. But let me up.
Give me your word.
Is that really necessary?he demanded. She blinked.Very well. I give you my word that I will fly with you
tomorrow. Satisfied?
I am content.
Saphira let him up and, with a push of her legs, took off. A small shiver ran through Eragon as he
watched her twist through the air. Grumbling, he returned to Cadoc and followed Brom.
It was nearly sundown when they made camp. As usual, Eragon dueled with Brom before dinner. In the

Page 95

midst of the fight, Eragon delivered such a powerful blow that he snapped both of their sticks like twigs.
The pieces whistled into the darkness in a cloud of splintered fragments. Brom tossed what remained of
his stick into the fire and said, “We’re done with these; throw yours in as well. You have learned well,
but we’ve gone as far as we can with branches. There is nothing more you can gain from them. It is time
for you to use the blade.” He removed Zar’roc from Eragon’s bag and gave it to him.
“We’ll cut each other to ribbons,” protested Eragon.
“Not so. Again you forget magic,” said Brom. He held up his sword and turned it so that firelight glinted
off the edge. He put a finger on either side of the blade and focused intensely, deepening the lines on his
forehead. For a moment nothing happened, then he uttered, “Gëuloth du knífr!” and a small red spark
jumped between his fingers. As it flickered back and forth, he ran his fingers down the length of the
sword. Then he twirled it and did the same thing on the other side. The spark vanished the moment his
fingers left the metal.
Brom held his hand out, palm up, and slashed it with the sword. Eragon jumped forward but was too
slow to stop him. He was astonished when Brom raised his unharmed hand with a smile. “What did you
do?” asked Eragon.
“Feel the edge,” said Brom. Eragon touched it and felt an invisible surface under his fingers. The barrier
was about a quarter inch wide and very slippery. “Now do the same on Zar’roc,” instructed Brom.
“Your block will be a bit different than mine, but it should accomplish the same thing.”
He told Eragon how to pronounce the words and coached him through the process. It took Eragon a
few tries, but he soon had Zar’roc’s edge protected. Confident, he took his fighting stance. Before they
started, Brom admonished, “These swords won’t cut us, but they can still break bones. I would prefer to
avoid that, so don’t flail around like you normally do. A blow to the neck could prove fatal.”
Eragon nodded, then struck without warning. Sparks flew off his blade, and the clash of metal filled their
campsite as Brom parried. The sword felt slow and heavy to Eragon after fighting with sticks for so long.
Unable to move Zar’roc fast enough, he received a sharp rap on his knee.
They both had large welts when they stopped, Eragon more so than Brom. He marveled that Zar’roc
had not been scratched or dented by the vigorous pounding it had received.
THROUGH ADRAGON’SEYE
The next morning Eragon woke with stiff limbs and purple bruises. He saw Brom carry the saddle to
Saphira and tried to quell his uneasiness. By the time breakfast was ready, Brom had strapped the saddle
onto Saphira and hung Eragon’s bags from it.
When his bowl was empty, Eragon silently picked up his bow and went to Saphira. Brom said, “Now
remember, grip with your knees, guide her with your thoughts, and stay as flat as you can on her back.
Nothing will go wrong if you don’t panic.” Eragon nodded, sliding his unstrung bow into its leather tube,
and Brom boosted him into the saddle.
Saphira waited impatiently while Eragon tightened the bands around his legs.Are you ready? she asked.
He sucked in the fresh morning air.No, but let’s do it! She agreed enthusiastically. He braced himself as
she crouched. Her powerful legs surged and the air whipped past him, snatching his breath away. With
three smooth strokes of her wings, she was in the sky, climbing rapidly.

Page 96

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

The last time Eragon had ridden Saphira, every flap of her wings had been strained. Now she flew
steadily and effortlessly. He clenched his arms around her neck as she turned on edge, banking. The river
shrank to a wispy gray line beneath them. Clouds floated around them.
When they leveled off high above the plains, the trees below were no more than specks. The air was
thin, chilly, and perfectly clear. “This is wonderfu—” His words were lost as Saphira tilted and rolled
completely around. The ground spun in a dizzying circle, and vertigo clutched Eragon. “Don’t do that!”
he cried. “I feel like I’m going to fall off.”
You must become accustomed to it. If I’m attacked in the air, that’s one of the simplest maneuvers I will
do,she replied. He could think of no rebuttal, so he concentrated on controlling his stomach. Saphira
angled into a shallow dive and slowly approached the ground.
Although Eragon’s stomach lurched with every wobble, he began to enjoy himself. He relaxed his arms a
bit and stretched his neck back, taking in the scenery. Saphira let him enjoy the sights awhile, then said,
Let me show you what flying is really like.
How?he asked.
Relax and do not be afraid,she said.
Her mind tugged at his, pulling him away from his body. Eragon fought for a moment, then surrendered
control. His vision blurred, and he found himself looking through Saphira’s eyes. Everything was
distorted: colors had weird, exotic tints; blues were more prominent now, while greens and reds were
subdued. Eragon tried to turn his head and body but could not. He felt like a ghost who had slipped out
of the ether.
Pure joy radiated from Saphira as she climbed into the sky. She loved this freedom to go anywhere.
When they were high above the ground, she looked back at Eragon. He saw himself as she did, hanging
on to her with a blank look. He could feel her body strain against the air, using updrafts to rise. All her
muscles were like his own. He felt her tail swinging through the air like a giant rudder to correct her
course. It surprised him how much she depended on it.
Their connection grew stronger until there was no distinction between their identities. They clasped their
wings together and dived straight down, like a spear thrown from on high. No terror of falling touched
Eragon, engulfed as he was in Saphira’s exhilaration. The air rushed past their face. Their tail whipped in
the air, and their joined minds reveled in the experience.
Even as they plummeted toward the ground, there was no fear of collision. They snapped open their
wings at just the right moment, pulling out of the dive with their combined strength. Slanting toward the
sky, they shot up and continued back over into a giant loop.
As they leveled out, their minds began to diverge, becoming distinct personalities again. For a split
second, Eragon felt both his body and Saphira’s. Then his vision blurred and he again sat on her back.
He gasped and collapsed on the saddle. It was minutes before his heart stopped hammering and his
breathing calmed. Once he had recovered, he exclaimed,That was incredible! How can you bear to land
when you enjoy flying so much?
I must eat,she said with some amusement.But I am glad that you took pleasure in it.

Page 97

Those are spare words for such an experience. I’m sorry I haven’t flown with you more; I never thought
it could be like that. Do you always see so much blue?
It is the way I am. We will fly together more often now?
Yes! Every chance we get.
Good,she replied in a contented tone.
They exchanged many thoughts as she flew, talking as they had not for weeks. Saphira showed Eragon
how she used hills and trees to hide and how she could conceal herself in the shadow of a cloud. They
scouted the trail for Brom, which proved to be more arduous than Eragon expected. They could not see
the path unless Saphira flew very close to it, in which case she risked being detected.
Near midday, an annoying buzz filled Eragon’s ears, and he became aware of a strange pressure on his
mind. He shook his head, trying to get rid of it, but the tension only grew stronger. Brom’s words about
how people could break into others’ minds flashed through Eragon’s head, and he frantically tried to
clear his thoughts. He concentrated on one of Saphira’s scales and forced himself to ignore everything
else. The pressure faded for a moment and then returned, greater than ever. A sudden gust rocked
Saphira, and Eragon’s concentration slipped. Before he could marshal any defenses, the force broke
through. But instead of the invasive presence of another mind, there were only the words,What do you
think you’re doing? Get down here. I found something important.
Brom?queried Eragon.
Yes,the old man said irritably.Now get that oversized lizard of yours to land. I’m here… He sent a
picture of his location. Eragon quickly told Saphira where to go, and she banked toward the river below.
Meanwhile, he strung his bow and drew several arrows.
If there’s trouble, I’ll be ready for it.
As will I,said Saphira.
When they reached Brom, Eragon saw him standing in a clearing, waving his arms. Saphira landed, and
Eragon jumped off her and looked for danger. The horses were tied to a tree on the edge of the clearing,
but otherwise Brom was alone. Eragon trotted over and asked, “What’s wrong?”
Brom scratched his chin and muttered a string of curses. “Don’t ever block me out like that again. It’s
hard enough for me to reach you without having to fight to make myself heard.”
“Sorry.”
He snorted. “I was farther down the river when I noticed that the Ra’zac’s tracks had ceased. I
backtracked until I found where they had disappeared. Look at the ground and tell me what you see.”
Eragon knelt and examined the dirt and found a confusion of impressions that were difficult to decipher.
Numerous Ra’zac footprints overlapped each other. Eragon guessed that the tracks were only a few
days old. Superimposed over them were long, thick gouges torn into the ground. They looked familiar,
but Eragon could not say why.
He stood, shaking his head. “I don’t have any idea what…” Then his eyes fell on Saphira and he realized

Page 98

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

what had made the gouges. Every time she took off, her back claws dug into the ground and ripped it in
the same manner. “This doesn’t make any sense, but the only thing I can think of is that the Ra’zac flew
off on dragons. Or else they got onto giant birds and disappeared into the heavens. Tell me you have a
better explanation.”
Brom shrugged. “I’ve heard reports of the Ra’zac moving from place to place with incredible speed, but
this is the first evidence I’ve had of it. It will be almost impossible to find them if they have flying steeds.
They aren’t dragons—I know that much. A dragon would never consent to bear a Ra’zac.”
“What do we do? Saphira can’t track them through the sky. Even if she could, we would leave you far
behind.”
“There’s no easy solution to this riddle,” said Brom. “Let’s have lunch while we think on it. Perhaps
inspiration will strike us while we eat.” Eragon glumly went to his bags for food. They ate in silence,
staring at the empty sky.
Once again Eragon thought of home and wondered what Roran was doing. A vision of the burnt farm
appeared before him and grief threatened to overwhelm him.What will I do if we can’t find the Ra’zac?
What is my purpose then? I could return to Carvahall— he plucked a twig from the ground and snapped
it between two fingers—or just travel with Brom and continue my training.Eragon stared out at the plains,
hoping to quiet his thoughts.
When Brom finished eating, he stood and threw back his hood. “I have considered every trick I know,
every word of power within my grasp, and all the skills we have, but I still don’t see how we can find the
Ra’zac.” Eragon slumped against Saphira in despair. “Saphira could show herself at some town. That
would draw the Ra’zac like flies to honey. But it would be an extremely risky thing to attempt. The
Ra’zac would bring soldiers with them, and the king might be interested enough to come himself, which
would spell certain death for you and me.”
“So what now?” asked Eragon, throwing his hands up.Do you have any ideas, Saphira?
No.
“That’s up to you,” said Brom. “This is your crusade.”
Eragon ground his teeth angrily and stalked away from Brom and Saphira. Just as he was about to enter
the trees, his foot struck something hard. Lying on the ground was a metal flask with a leather strap just
long enough to hang off someone’s shoulder. A silver insignia Eragon recognized as the Ra’zac’s symbol
was wrought into it.
Excited, he picked up the flask and unscrewed its cap. A cloying smell filled the air—the same one he
had noticed when he found Garrow in the wreckage of their house. He tilted the flask, and a drop of
clear, shiny liquid fell on his finger. Instantly Eragon’s finger burned as if it were on fire. He yelped and
scrubbed his hand on the ground. After a moment the pain subsided to a dull throbbing. A patch of skin
had been eaten away.
Grimacing, he jogged back to Brom. “Look what I found.” Brom took the flask and examined it, then
poured a bit of the liquid into the cap. Eragon started to warn him, “Watch out, it’ll burn—”
“My skin, I know,” said Brom. “And I suppose you went ahead and poured it all over your hand. Your
finger? Well, at least you showed sense enough not to drink it. Only a puddle would have been left of

Page 99

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

you.”
“What is it?” asked Eragon.
“Oil from the petals of the Seithr plant, which grows on a small island in the frigid northern seas. In its
natural state, the oil is used for preserving pearls—it makes them lustrous and strong. But when specific
words are spoken over the oil, along with a blood sacrifice, it gains the property to eat any flesh. That
alone wouldn’t make it special—there are plenty of acids that can dissolve sinew and bone—except for
the fact that it leaves everything else untouched. You can dip anything into the oil and pull it out
unharmed, unless it was once part of an animal or human. This has made it a weapon of choice for torture
and assassination. It can be stored in wood, slathered on the point of a spear, or dripped onto sheets so
that the next person to touch them will be burned. There are myriad uses for it, limited only by your
ingenuity. Any injury caused by it is always slow to heal. It’s rather rare and expensive, especially this
converted form.”
Eragon remembered the terrible burns that had covered Garrow.That’s what they used on him, he
realized with horror. “I wonder why the Ra’zac left it behind if it’s so valuable.”
“It must have slipped off when they flew away.”
“But why didn’t they come back for it? I doubt that the king will be pleased that they lost it.”
“No, he won’t,” said Brom, “but he would be even more displeased if they delayed bringing him news of
you. In fact, if the Ra’zac have reached him by now, you can be sure that the king has learned your
name. And that means we will have to be much more careful when we go into towns. There will be
notices and alerts about you posted throughout the Empire.”
Eragon paused to think. “This oil, how rare is it exactly?”
“Like diamonds in a pig trough,” said Brom. He amended himself after a second, “Actually, the normal
oil is used by jewelers, but only those who can afford it.”
“So there are people who trade in it?”
“Perhaps one, maybe two.”
“Good,” said Eragon. “Now, do the cities along the coast keep shipping records?”
Brom’s eyes brightened. “Of course they do. If we could get to those records, they would tell us who
brought the oil south and where it went from there.”
“And the record of the Empire’s purchase will tell us where the Ra’zac live!” concluded Eragon. “I don’t
know how many people can afford this oil, but it shouldn’t be hard to figure out which ones aren’t
working for the Empire.”
“Genius!” exclaimed Brom, smiling. “I wish I had thought of this years ago; it would have saved me
many headaches. The coast is dotted with numerous cities and towns where ships can land. I suppose
that Teirm would be the place to start, as it controls most of the trade.” Brom paused. “The last I heard,
my old friend Jeod lives there. We haven’t seen each other for many years, but he might be willing to help
us. And because he’s a merchant, it’s possible that he has access to those records.”

Page 100

“How do we get to Teirm?”
“We’ll have to go southwest until we reach a high pass in the Spine. Once on the other side, we can
head up the coast to Teirm,” said Brom. A gentle wind pulled at his hair.
“Can we reach the pass within a week?”
“Easily. If we angle away from the Ninor and to our right, we might be able to see the mountains by
tomorrow.”
Eragon went to Saphira and mounted her. “I’ll see you at dinner, then.” When they were at a good
height, he said,I’m going to ride Cadoc tomorrow. Before you protest, know that I am only doing it
because I want to talk with Brom.
You should ride with him every other day. That way you can still receive your instruction, and I will have
time to hunt.
You won’t be troubled by it?
It is necessary.
When they landed for the day, he was pleased to discover that his legs did not hurt. The saddle had
protected him well from Saphira’s scales.
Eragon and Brom had their nightly fight, but it lacked energy, as both were preoccupied with the day’s
events. By the time they finished, Eragon’s arms burned from Zar’roc’s unaccustomed weight.
ASONG FOR THEROAD
The next day while they were riding, Eragon asked Brom, “What is the sea like?”
“You must have heard it described before,” said Brom.
“Yes, but what is it really like?”
Brom’s eyes grew hazy, as if he looked upon some hidden scene. “The sea is emotion incarnate. It
loves, hates, and weeps. It defies all attempts to capture it with words and rejects all shackles. No matter
what you say about it, there is always that which you can’t. Do you remember what I told you about how
the elves came over the sea?”
“Yes.”
“Though they live far from the coast, they retain a great fascination and passion for the ocean. The sound
of crashing waves, the smell of salt air, it affects them deeply and has inspired many of their loveliest
songs. There is one that tells of this love, if you want to hear it.”
“I would,” said Eragon, interested.
Brom cleared his throat and said, “I will translate it from the ancient language as best I can. It won’t be
perfect, but perhaps it will give you an idea of how the original sounds.” He pulled Snowfire to a stop and
closed his eyes. He was silent for a while, then chanted softly:

Page 101

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

O liquid temptress ’neath the azure sky,
Your gilded expanse calls me, calls me.
For I would sail ever on,
Were it not for the elven maid,
Who calls me, calls me.
She binds my heart with a lily-white tie,
Never to be broken, save by the sea,
Ever to be torn twixt the trees and the waves.

The words echoed hauntingly in Eragon’s head. “There is much more to that song, the ‘Du Silbena
Datia.’ I have only recited one of its verses. It tells the sad tale of two lovers, Acallamh and Nuada, who
were separated by longing for the sea. The elves find great meaning in the story.”
“It’s beautiful,” said Eragon simply.
The Spine was a faint outline on the horizon when they halted that evening.

When they arrived at the Spine’s foothills, they turned and followed the mountains south. Eragon was
glad to be near the mountains again; they placed comforting boundaries on the world. Three days later
they came to a wide road rutted by wagon wheels. “This is the main road between the capital, Urû’baen,
and Teirm,” said Brom. “It’s widely used and a favorite route for merchants. We have to be more
cautious. This isn’t the busiest time of year, but a few people are bound to be using the road.”
Days passed quickly as they continued to trek along the Spine, searching for the mountain pass. Eragon
could not complain of boredom. When not learning the elven language, he was either learning how to
care for Saphira or practicing magic. Eragon also learned how to kill game with magic, which saved them
time hunting. He would hold a small rock on his hand and shoot it at his prey. It was impossible to miss.
The results of his efforts roasted over the fire each night. And after dinner, Brom and Eragon would spar
with swords and, occasionally, fists.
The long days and strenuous work stripped Eragon’s body of excess fat. His arms became corded, and
his tanned skin rippled with lean muscles.Everything about me is turning hard, he thought dryly.
When they finally reached the pass, Eragon saw that a river rushed out of it and cut across the road.
“This is the Toark,” explained Brom. “We’ll follow it all the way to the sea.”
“How can we,” laughed Eragon, “if it flows out of the Spine inthis direction? It won’t end up in the ocean

Page 102

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

unless it doubles back on itself.”
Brom twisted the ring on his finger. “Because in the middle of the mountains rests the Woadark Lake. A
river flows from each end of it and both are called the Toark. We see the eastward one now. It runs to
the south and winds through the brush until it joins Leona Lake. The other one goes to the sea.”
After two days in the Spine, they came upon a rock ledge from which they could see clearly out of the
mountains. Eragon noticed how the land flattened in the distance, and he groaned at the leagues they still
had to traverse. Brom pointed. “Down there and to the north lies Teirm. It is an old city. Some say it’s
where the elves first landed in Alagaësia. Its citadel has never fallen, nor have its warriors ever been
defeated.” He spurred Snowfire forward and left the ledge.

It took them until noon the next day to descend through the foothills and arrive at the other side of the
Spine, where the forested land quickly leveled out. Without the mountains to hide behind, Saphira flew
close to the ground, using every hollow and dip in the land to conceal herself.
Beyond the forest, they noticed a change. The countryside was covered with soft turf and heather that
their feet sank into. Moss clung to every stone and branch and lined the streams that laced the ground.
Pools of mud pocked the road where horses had trampled the dirt. Before long both Brom and Eragon
were splattered with grime.
“Why is everything green?” asked Eragon. “Don’t they have winter here?”
“Yes, but the season is mild. Mist and fog roll in from the sea and keep everything alive. Some find it to
their liking, but to me it’s dreary and depressing.”
When evening fell, they set up camp in the driest spot they could find. As they ate, Brom commented,
“You should continue to ride Cadoc until we reach Teirm. It’s likely that we’ll meet other travelers now
that we are out of the Spine, and it will be better if you are with me. An old man traveling alone will raise
suspicion. With you at my side, no one will ask questions. Besides, I don’t want to show up at the city
and have someone who saw me on the trail wondering where you suddenly came from.”
“Will we use our own names?” asked Eragon.
Brom thought about it. “We won’t be able to deceive Jeod. He already knows my name, and I think I
trust him with yours. But to everyone else, I will be Neal and you will be my nephew Evan. If our tongues
slip and give us away, it probably won’t make a difference, but I don’t want our names in anyone’s
heads. People have an annoying habit of remembering things they shouldn’t.”
ATASTE OFTEIRM
After two days of traveling north toward the ocean, Saphira sighted Teirm. A heavy fog clung to the
ground, obscuring Brom’s and Eragon’s sight until a breeze from the west blew the mist away. Eragon
gaped as Teirm was suddenly revealed before them, nestled by the edge of the shimmering sea, where
proud ships were docked with furled sails. The surf’s dull thunder could be heard in the distance.
The city was contained behind a white wall—a hundred feet tall and thirty feet thick—with rows of
rectangular arrow slits lining it and a walkway on top for soldiers and watchmen. The wall’s smooth
surface was broken by two iron portcullises, one facing the western sea, the other opening south to the

Page 103

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

road. Above the wall—and set against its northeast section—rose a huge citadel built of giant stones and
turrets. In the highest tower, a lighthouse lantern gleamed brilliantly. The castle was the only thing visible
over the fortifications.
Soldiers guarded the southern gate but held their pikes carelessly. “This is our first test,” said Brom.
“Let’s hope they haven’t received reports of us from the Empire and won’t detain us. Whatever happens,
don’t panic or act suspiciously.”
Eragon told Saphira,You should land somewhere now and hide. We’re going in.
Sticking your nose where it doesn’t belong. Again,she said sourly.
I know. But Brom and I do have some advantages most people don’t. We’ll be all right.
If anything happens, I’m going to pin you to my back and never let you off.
I love you too.
Then I will bind you all the tighter.
Eragon and Brom rode toward the gate, trying to appear casual. A yellow pennant bearing the outline of
a roaring lion and an arm holding a lily blossom waved over the entrance. As they neared the wall,
Eragon asked in amazement, “How big is this place?”
“Larger than any city you have ever seen,” said Brom.
At the entrance to Teirm, the guards stood straighter and blocked the gate with their pikes. “Wha’s yer
name?” asked one of them in a bored tone.
“I’m called Neal,” said Brom in a wheezy voice, slouching to one side, an expression of happy idiocy on
his face.
“And who’s th’ other one?” asked the guard.
“Well, I wus gettin’ to that. This’ed be m’nephew Evan. He’s m’sister’s boy, not a…”
The guard nodded impatiently. “Yeah, yeah. And yer business here?”
“He’s visitin’ an old friend,” supplied Eragon, dropping his voice into a thick accent. “I’m along t’ make
sure he don’t get lost, if y’ get m’meaning. He ain’t as young as he used to be—had a bit too much sun
when he was young’r. Touch o’ the brain fever, y’ know.” Brom bobbed his head pleasantly.
“Right. Go on through,” said the guard, waving his hand and dropping the pike. “Just make sure he
doesn’t cause any trouble.”
“Oh, he won’t,” promised Eragon. He urged Cadoc forward, and they rode into Teirm. The
cobblestone street clacked under the horses’ hooves.
Once they were away from the guards, Brom sat up and growled, “Touch of brain fever, eh?”
“I couldn’t let you have all the fun,” teased Eragon.

Brom harrumphed and looked away.
The houses were grim and foreboding. Small, deep windows let in only sparse rays of light. Narrow
doors were recessed into the buildings. The tops of the roofs were flat—except for metal railings—and
all were covered with slate shingles. Eragon noticed that the houses closest to Teirm’s outer wall were no
more than one story, but the buildings got progressively higher as they went in. Those next to the citadel
were tallest of all, though insignificant compared to the fortress.
“This place looks ready for war,” said Eragon.
Brom nodded. “Teirm has a history of being attacked by pirates, Urgals, and other enemies. It has long
been a center of commerce. There will always be conflict where riches gather in such abundance. The
people here have been forced to take extraordinary measures to keep themselves from being overrun. It
also helps that Galbatorix gives them soldiers to defend their city.”
“Why are some houses higher than others?”
“Look at the citadel,” said Brom, pointing. “It has an unobstructed view of Teirm. If the outer wall were
breached, archers would be posted on all the roofs. Because the houses in the front, by the outer wall,
are lower, the men farther back could shoot over them without fear of hitting their comrades. Also, if the
enemy were to capture those houses and put their own archers on them, it would be an easy matter to
shoot them down.”
“I’ve never seen a city planned like this,” said Eragon in wonder.
“Yes, but it was only done after Teirm was nearly burned down by a pirate raid,” commented Brom. As
they continued up the street, people gave them searching looks, but there was not an undue amount of
interest.
Compared to our reception at Daret, we’ve been welcomed with open arms. Perhaps Teirm has
escaped notice by the Urgals,thought Eragon. He changed his opinion when a large man shouldered past
them, a sword hanging from his waist. There were other, subtler signs of adverse times: no children
played in the streets, people bore hard expressions, and many houses were deserted, with weeds
growing from cracks in their stone-covered yards. “It looks like they’ve had trouble,” said Eragon.
“The same as everywhere else,” said Brom grimly. “We have to find Jeod.” They led their horses across
the street to a tavern and tied them to the hitching post. “The Green Chestnut… wonderful,” muttered
Brom, looking at the battered sign above them as he and Eragon entered the building.
The dingy room felt unsafe. A fire smoldered in the fireplace, yet no one bothered to throw more wood
on it. A few lonely people in the corners nursed their drinks with sullen expressions. A man missing two
fingers sat at a far table, eyeing his twitching stumps. The bartender had a cynical twist to his lips and held
a glass in his hand that he kept polishing, even though it was broken.
Brom leaned against the bar and asked, “Do you know where we can find a man called Jeod?” Eragon
stood at his side, fiddling with the tip of his bow by his waist. It was slung across his back, but right then
he wished that it were in his hands.
The bartender said in an overly loud voice, “Now, why would I know something like that? Do you think
I keep track of the mangy louts in this forsaken place?” Eragon winced as all eyes turned toward them.

Page 105

Brom kept talking smoothly. “Could you be enticed to remember?” He slid some coins onto the bar.
The man brightened and put his glass down. “Could be,” he replied, lowering his voice, “but my memory
takes a great deal of prodding.” Brom’s face soured, but he slid more coins onto the bar. The bartender
sucked on one side of his cheek undecidedly. “All right,” he finally said, and reached for the coins.
Before he touched them, the man missing two fingers called out from his table, “Gareth, what in th’
blazes do you think you’re doing? Anyone on the street could tell them where Jeod lives. What are you
charging them for?”
Brom swept the coins back into his purse. Gareth shot a venomous look at the man at the table, then
turned his back on them and picked up the glass again. Brom went to the stranger and said, “Thanks.
The name’s Neal. This is Evan.”
The man raised his mug to them. “Martin, and of course you met Gareth.” His voice was deep and
rough. Martin gestured at some empty chairs. “Go ahead and sit down. I don’t mind.” Eragon took a
chair and arranged it so his back was to the wall and he faced the door. Martin raised an eyebrow, but
made no comment.
“You just saved me a few crowns,” said Brom.
“My pleasure. Can’t blame Gareth, though—business hasn’t been doing so well lately.” Martin
scratched his chin. “Jeod lives on the west side of town, right next to Angela, the herbalist. Do you have
business with him?”
“Of a sort,” said Brom.
“Well, he won’t be interested in buying anything; he just lost another ship a few days ago.”
Brom latched onto the news with interest. “What happened? It wasn’t Urgals, was it?”
“No,” said Martin. “They’ve left the area. No one’s seen ’em in almost a year. It seems they’ve all gone
south and east. But they aren’t the problem. See, most of our business is through sea trade, as I’m sure
you know. Well,” he stopped to drink from his mug, “starting several months ago, someone’s been
attacking our ships. It’s not the usual piracy, because only ships that carry the goods of certain merchants
are attacked. Jeod’s one of ’em. It’s gotten so bad that no captain will accept those merchants’ goods,
which makes life difficult around here. Especially because some of ’em run the largest shipping businesses
in the Empire. They’re being forced to send goods by land. It’s driven costs painfully high, and their
caravans don’t always make it.”
“Do you have any idea who’s responsible? There must be witnesses,” said Brom.
Martin shook his head. “No one survives the attacks. Ships go out, then disappear; they’re never seen
again.” He leaned toward them and said in a confidential tone, “The sailors are saying that it’s magic.” He
nodded and winked, then leaned back.
Brom seemed worried by his words. “What do you think?”
Martin shrugged carelessly. “I don’t know. And I don’t think I will unless I’m unfortunate enough to be
on one of those captured ships.”

Page 106

“Are you a sailor?” asked Eragon.
“No,” snorted Martin. “Do I look like one? The captains hire me to defend their ships against pirates.
And those thieving scum haven’t been very active lately. Still, it’s a good job.”
“But a dangerous one,” said Brom. Martin shrugged again and downed the last of his beer. Brom and
Eragon took their leave and headed to the west side of the city, a nicer section of Teirm. The houses
were clean, ornate, and large. The people in the streets wore expensive finery and walked with authority.
Eragon felt conspicuous and out of place.
ANOLDFRIEND
The herbalist’s shop had a cheery sign and was easy to find. A short, curly-haired woman sat by the
door. She was holding a frog in one hand and writing with the other. Eragon assumed that she was
Angela, the herbalist. On either side of the store was a house. “Which one do you think is his?” he asked.
Brom deliberated, then said, “Let’s find out.” He approached the woman and asked politely, “Could
you tell us which house Jeod lives in?”
“I could.” She continued writing.
“Will you tell us?”
“Yes.” She fell silent, but her pen scribbled faster than ever. The frog on her hand croaked and looked
at them with baleful eyes. Brom and Eragon waited uncomfortably, but she said no more. Eragon was
about to blurt something out when Angela looked up. “Of course I’ll tell you! All you have to do is ask.
Your first question was whether or not Icould tell you, and the second was if Iwould tell you. But you
never actually put the question to me.”
“Then let me ask properly,” said Brom with a smile. “Which house is Jeod’s? And why are you holding
a frog?”
“Now we’re getting somewhere,” she bantered. “Jeod is on the right. And as for the frog, he’s actually a
toad. I’m trying to prove that toads don’t exist—that there are only frogs.”
“How can toads not exist if you have one on your hand right now?” interrupted Eragon. “Besides, what
good will it do, proving that there are only frogs?”
The woman shook her head vigorously, dark curls bouncing. “No, no, you don’t understand. If I prove
toads don’t exist, then this is a frog and never was a toad. Therefore, the toad you see now doesn’t exist.
And,” she raised a small finger, “if I can prove there are only frogs, then toads won’t be able to do
anything bad—like make teeth fall out, cause warts, and poison or kill people. Also, witches won’t be
able to use any of their evil spells because, of course, there won’t be any toads around.”
“I see,” said Brom delicately. “It sounds interesting, and I would like to hear more, but we have to meet
Jeod.”
“Of course,” she said, waving her hand and returning to her writing.
Once they were out of the herbalist’s hearing, Eragon said, “She’s crazy!”

Page 107

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“It’s possible,” said Brom, “but you never know. She might discover something useful, so don’t criticize.
Who knows, toads might really be frogs!”
“And my shoes are made of gold,” retorted Eragon.
They stopped before a door with a wrought-iron knocker and marble doorstep. Brom banged three
times. No one answered. Eragon felt slightly foolish. “Maybe this is the wrong house. Let’s try the other
one,” he said. Brom ignored him and knocked again, pounding loudly.
Again no one answered. Eragon turned away in exasperation, then heard someone run to the door. A
young woman with a pale complexion and light blond hair cracked it open. Her eyes were puffy; it
looked like she had been crying, but her voice was perfectly steady. “Yes, what do you want?”
“Does Jeod live here?” asked Brom kindly.
The woman dipped her head a little. “Yes, he is my husband. Is he expecting you?” She opened the
door no farther.
“No, but we need to talk with him,” said Brom.
“He is very busy.”
“We have traveled far. It’s very important that we see him.”
Her face hardened. “He is busy.”
Brom bristled, but his voice stayed pleasant. “Since he is unavailable, would you please give him a
message?” Her mouth twitched, but she consented. “Tell him that a friend from Gil’ead is waiting
outside.”
The woman seemed suspicious, but said, “Very well.” She closed the door abruptly. Eragon heard her
footsteps recede.
“That wasn’t very polite.” he commented.
“Keep your opinions to yourself,” snapped Brom. “And don’t say anything. Let me do the talking.” He
crossed his arms and tapped his fingers. Eragon clamped his mouth shut and looked away.
The door suddenly flew open, and a tall man burst out of the house. His expensive clothes were
rumpled, his gray hair wispy, and he had a mournful face with short eyebrows. A long scar stretched
across his scalp to his temple.
At the sight of them, his eyes grew wide, and he sagged against the doorframe, speechless. His mouth
opened and closed several times like a gasping fish. He asked softly, in an incredulous voice, “Brom…?”
Brom put a finger to his lips and reached forward, clasping the man’s arm. “It’s good to see you, Jeod!
I’m glad that memory has not failed you, but don’t use that name. It would be unfortunate if anyone knew
I was here.”
Jeod looked around wildly, shock plain on his face. “I thought you were dead,” he whispered. “What

Page 108

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

happened? Why haven’t you contacted me before?”
“All things will be explained. Do you have a place where we can talk safely?”
Jeod hesitated, swinging his gaze between Eragon and Brom, face unreadable. Finally he said, “We
can’t talk here, but if you wait a moment, I’ll take you somewhere we can.”
“Fine,” said Brom. Jeod nodded and vanished behind the door.
I hope I can learn something of Brom’s past,thought Eragon.
There was a rapier at Jeod’s side when he reappeared. An embroidered jacket hung loosely on his
shoulders, matched by a plumed hat. Brom cast a critical eye at the finery, and Jeod shrugged
self-consciously.
He took them through Teirm toward the citadel. Eragon led the horses behind the two men. Jeod
gestured at their destination. “Risthart, the lord of Teirm, has decreed that all the business owners must
have their headquarters in his castle. Even though most of us conduct our business elsewhere, we still
have to rent rooms there. It’s nonsense, but we abide by it anyway to keep him calm. We’ll be free of
eavesdroppers in there; the walls are thick.”
They went through the fortress’s main gate and into the keep. Jeod strode to a side door and pointed to
an iron ring. “You can tie the horses there. No one will bother them.” When Snowfire and Cadoc were
safely tethered, he opened the door with an iron key and let them inside.
Within was a long, empty hallway lit by torches set into the walls. Eragon was surprised by how cold
and damp it was. When he touched the wall, his fingers slid over a layer of slime. He shivered.
Jeod snatched a torch from its bracket and led them down the hall. They stopped before a heavy,
wooden door. He unlocked it and ushered them into a room dominated by a bearskin rug laden with
stuffed chairs. Bookshelves stacked with leather-bound tomes covered the walls.
Jeod piled wood in the fireplace, then thrust the torch under it. The fire quickly roared. “You, old man,
have some explaining to do.”
Brom’s face crinkled with a smile. “Who are you calling an old man? The last time I saw you there was
no gray in your hair. Now it looks like it’s in the final stages of decomposition.”
“And you look the same as you did nearly twenty years ago. Time seems to have preserved you as a
crotchety old man just to inflict wisdom upon each new generation. Enough of this! Get on with the story.
That’s always what you were good at,” said Jeod impatiently. Eragon’s ears pricked up, and he waited
eagerly to hear what Brom would say.
Brom relaxed into a chair and pulled out his pipe. He slowly blew a smoke ring that turned green, darted
into the fireplace, then flew up the chimney. “Do you remember what we were doing in Gil’ead?”
“Yes, of course,” said Jeod. “That sort of thing is hard to forget.”
“An understatement, but true nevertheless,” said Brom dryly. “When we were… separated, I couldn’t
find you. In the midst of the turmoil I stumbled into a small room. There wasn’t anything extraordinary in
it—just crates and boxes—but out of curiosity, I rummaged around anyway. Fortune smiled on me that

hour, for I found what we had been searching for.” An expression of shock ran over Jeod’s face. “Once
it was in my hands, I couldn’t wait for you. At any second I might have been discovered, and all lost.
Disguising myself as best I could, I fled the city and ran to the…” Brom hesitated and glanced at Eragon,
then said, “ran to our friends. They stored it in a vault, for safekeeping, and made me promise to care for
whomever received it. Until the day when my skills would be needed, I had to disappear. No one could
know that I was alive—not even you—though it grieved me to pain you unnecessarily. So I went north
and hid in Carvahall.”
Eragon clenched his jaw, infuriated that Brom was deliberately keeping him in the dark.
Jeod frowned and asked, “Then our… friends knew that you were alive all along?”
“Yes.”
He sighed. “I suppose the ruse was unavoidable, though I wish they had told me. Isn’t Carvahall farther
north, on the other side of the Spine?” Brom inclined his head. For the first time, Jeod inspected Eragon.
His gray eyes took in every detail. He raised his eyebrows and said, “I assume, then, that you are fulfilling
your duty.”
Brom shook his head. “No, it’s not that simple. It was stolen a while ago—at least that’s what I
presume, for I haven’t received word from our friends, and I suspect their messengers were waylaid—so
I decided to find out what I could. Eragon happened to be traveling in the same direction. We have
stayed together for a time now.”
Jeod looked puzzled. “But if they haven’t sent any messages, how could you know that it was—”
Brom overrode him quickly, saying, “Eragon’s uncle was brutally killed by the Ra’zac. They burned his
home and nearly caught him in the process. He deserves revenge, but they have left us without a trail to
follow, and we need help finding them.”
Jeod’s face cleared. “I see… But why have you come here? I don’t know where the Ra’zac might be
hiding, and anyone who does won’t tell you.”
Standing, Brom reached into his robe and pulled out the Ra’zac’s flask. He tossed it to Jeod. “There’s
Seithr oil in there—the dangerous kind. The Ra’zac were carrying it. They lost it by the trail, and we
happened to find it. We need to see Teirm’s shipping records so we can trace the Empire’s purchases of
the oil. That should tell us where the Ra’zac’s lair is.”
Lines appeared on Jeod’s face as he thought. He pointed at the books on the shelves. “Do you see
those? They are all records from my business.One business. You have gotten yourself into a project that
could take months. There is another, greater problem. The records you seek are held in this castle, but
only Brand, Risthart’s administrator of trade, sees them on a regular basis. Traders such as myself aren’t
allowed to handle them. They fear that we will falsify the results, thus cheating the Empire of its precious
taxes.”
“I can deal with that when the time comes,” said Brom. “But we need a few days of rest before we can
think about proceeding.”
Jeod smiled. “It seems that it is my turn to help you. My house is yours, of course. Do you have another
name while you are here?”

Page 110

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“Yes,” said Brom, “I’m Neal, and the boy is Evan.”
“Eragon,” said Jeod thoughtfully. “You have a unique name. Few have ever been named after the first
Rider. In my life I’ve read about only three people who were called such.” Eragon was startled that Jeod
knew the origin of his name.
Brom looked at Eragon. “Could you go check on the horses and make sure they’re all right? I don’t
think I tied Snowfire to the ring tightly enough.”
They’re trying to hide something from me. The moment I leave they’re going to talk about it.Eragon
shoved himself out of the chair and left the room, slamming the door shut. Snowfire had not moved; the
knot that held him was fine. Scratching the horses’ necks, Eragon leaned sullenly against the castle wall.
It’s not fair,he complained to himself.If only I could hear what they are saying. He jolted upright,
electrified. Brom had once taught him some words that would enhance his hearing.Keen ears aren’t
exactly what I want, but I should be able to make the words work. After all, look what I could do with
brisingr!
He concentrated intensely and reached for his power. Once it was within his grasp, he said, “Thverr
stenr un atra eka hórna!” and imbued the words with his will. As the power rushed out of him, he heard a
faint whisper in his ears, but nothing more. Disappointed, he sank back, then started as Jeod said,
“—and I’ve been doing that for almost eight years now.”
Eragon looked around. No one was there except for a few guards standing against the far wall of the
keep. Grinning, he sat on the courtyard and closed his eyes.
“I never expected you to become a merchant,” said Brom. “After all the time you spent in books. And
finding the passageway in that manner! What made you take up trading instead of remaining a scholar?”
“After Gil’ead, I didn’t have much taste for sitting in musty rooms and reading scrolls. I decided to help
Ajihad as best I could, but I’m no warrior. My father was a merchant as well—you may remember that.
He helped me get started. However, the bulk of my business is nothing more than a front to get goods
into Surda.”
“But I take it that things have been going badly,” said Brom.
“Yes, none of the shipments have gotten through lately, and Tronjheim is running low on supplies.
Somehow the Empire—at least I think it’s them—has discovered those of us who have been helping to
support Tronjheim. But I’m still not convinced that it’s the Empire. No one sees any soldiers. I don’t
understand it. Perhaps Galbatorix hired mercenaries to harass us.”
“I heard that you lost a ship recently.”
“The last one I owned,” answered Jeod bitterly. “Every man on it was loyal and brave. I doubt I’ll ever
see them again… The only option I have left is to send caravans to Surda or Gil’ead—which I know
won’t get there, no matter how many guards I hire—or charter someone else’s ship to carry the goods.
But no one will take them now.”
“How many merchants have been helping you?” asked Brom.
“Oh, a good number up and down the seaboard. All of them have been plagued by the same troubles. I

Page 111

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

know what you are thinking; I’ve pondered it many a night myself, but I cannot bear the thought of a
traitor with that much knowledge and power. If there is one, we’re all in jeopardy. You should return to
Tronjheim.”
“And take Eragon there?” interrupted Brom. “They’d tear him apart. It’s the worst place he could be
right now. Maybe in a few months or, even better, a year. Can you imagine how the dwarves will react?
Everyone will be trying to influence him, especially Islanzadi. He and Saphira won’t be safe in Tronjheim
until I at least get them through tuatha du orothrim.”
Dwarves!thought Eragon excitedly.Where is this Tronjheim? And why did he tell Jeod about Saphira?
He shouldn’t have done that without asking me!
“Still, I have a feeling that they are in need of your power and wisdom.”
“Wisdom,” snorted Brom. “I’m just what you said earlier—a crotchety old man.”
“Many would disagree.”
“Let them. I’ve no need to explain myself. No, Ajihad will have to get along without me. What I’m doing
now is much more important. But the prospect of a traitor raises troubling questions. I wonder if that’s
how the Empire knew where to be…” His voice trailed off.
“And I wonder why I haven’t been contacted about this,” said Jeod.
“Maybe they tried. But if there’s a traitor…” Brom paused. “I have to send word to Ajihad. Do you
have a messenger you can trust?”
“I think so,” said Jeod. “It depends on where he would have to go.”
“I don’t know,” said Brom. “I’ve been isolated so long, my contacts have probably died or forgotten
me. Could you send him to whoever receives your shipments?”
“Yes, but it’ll be risky.”
“What isn’t these days? How soon can he leave?”
“He can go in the morning. I’ll send him to Gil’ead. It will be faster,” said Jeod. “What can he take to
convince Ajihad the message comes from you?”
“Here, give your man my ring. And tell him that if he loses it, I’ll personally tear his liver out. It was given
to me by the queen.”
“Aren’t you cheery,” commented Jeod.
Brom grunted. After a long silence he said, “We’d better go out and join Eragon. I get worried when
he’s alone. That boy has an unnatural propensity for being wherever there’s trouble.”
“Are you surprised?”
“Not really.”

Page 112

Eragon heard chairs being pushed back. He quickly pulled his mind away and opened his eyes. “What’s
going on?” he muttered to himself.Jeod and other traders are in trouble for helping people the Empire
doesn’t favor. Brom found something in Gil’ead and went to Carvahall to hide. What could be so
important that he would let his own friend think he was dead for nearly twenty years? He mentioned a
queen—when there aren’t any queens in the known kingdoms—and dwarves, who, as he himself told
me, disappeared underground long ago.
He wanted answers! But he would not confront Brom now and risk jeopardizing their mission. No, he
would wait until they left Teirm, and then he would persist until the old man explained his secrets.
Eragon’s thoughts were still whirling when the door opened.
“Were the horses all right?” asked Brom.
“Fine,” said Eragon. They untied the horses and left the castle.
As they reentered the main body of Teirm, Brom said, “So, Jeod, you finally got married. And,” he
winked slyly, “to a lovely young woman. Congratulations.”
Jeod did not seem happy with the compliment. He hunched his shoulders and stared down at the street.
“Whether congratulations are in order is debatable right now. Helen isn’t very happy.”
“Why? What does she want?” asked Brom.
“The usual,” said Jeod with a resigned shrug. “A good home, happy children, food on the table, and
pleasant company. The problem is that she comes from a wealthy family; her father has invested heavily
in my business. If I keep suffering these losses, there won’t be enough money for her to live the way
she’s used to.”
Jeod continued, “But please, my troubles are not your troubles. A host should never bother his guests
with his own concerns. While you are in my house, I will let nothing more than an over-full stomach
disturb you.”
“Thank you,” said Brom. “We appreciate the hospitality. Our travels have long been without comforts of
any kind. Do you happen to know where we could find an inexpensive shop? All this riding has worn out
our clothes.”
“Of course. That’s my job,” said Jeod, lightening up. He talked eagerly about prices and stores until his
house was in sight. Then he asked, “Would you mind if we went somewhere else to eat? It might be
awkward if you came in right now.”
“Whatever makes you feel comfortable,” said Brom.
Jeod looked relieved. “Thanks. Let’s leave your horses in my stable.”
They did as he suggested, then followed him to a large tavern. Unlike the Green Chestnut, this one was
loud, clean, and full of boisterous people. When the main course arrived—a stuffed suckling pig—Eragon
eagerly dug into the meat, but he especially savored the potatoes, carrots, turnips, and sweet apples that
accompanied it. It had been a long time since he had eaten much more than wild game.
They lingered over the meal for hours as Brom and Jeod swapped stories. Eragon did not mind. He was
warm, a lively tune jangled in the background, and there was more than enough food. The spirited tavern

Page 113

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

babble fell pleasantly on his ears.
When they finally exited the tavern, the sun was nearing the horizon. “You two go ahead; I have to
check on something,” Eragon said. He wanted to see Saphira and make sure that she was safely hidden.
Brom agreed absently. “Be careful. Don’t take too long.”
“Wait,” said Jeod. “Are you going outside Teirm?” Eragon hesitated, then reluctantly nodded. “Make
sure you’re inside the walls before dark. The gates close then, and the guards won’t let you back in until
morning.”
“I won’t be late,” promised Eragon. He turned around and loped down a side street, toward Teirm’s
outer wall. Once out of the city, he breathed deeply, enjoying the fresh air.Saphira! he called.Where are
you? She guided him off the road, to the base of a mossy cliff surrounded by maples. He saw her head
poke out of the trees on the top and waved.How am I supposed to get up there?
If you find a clearing, I’ll come down and get you.
No,he said, eyeing the cliff,that won’t be necessary. I’ll just climb up.
It’s too dangerous.
And you worry too much. Let me have some fun.
Eragon pulled off his gloves and started climbing. He relished the physical challenge. There were plenty
of handholds, so the ascent was easy. He was soon high above the trees. Halfway up, he stopped on a
ledge to catch his breath.
Once his strength returned, he stretched up for the next handhold, but his arm was not long enough.
Stymied, he searched for another crevice or ridge to grasp. There was none. He tried backing down, but
his legs could not reach his last foothold. Saphira watched with unblinking eyes. He gave up and said,I
could use some help.
This is your own fault.
Yes! I know. Are you going to get me down or not?
If I weren’t around, you would be in a very bad situation.
Eragon rolled his eyes.You don’t have to tell me.
You’re right. After all, how can a mere dragon expect to tell a man like yourself what to do? In fact,
everyone should stand in awe of your brilliance of finding the only dead end. Why, if you had started a
few feet in either direction, the path to the top would have been clear.She cocked her head at him, eyes
bright.
All right! I made a mistake. Now can you please get me out of here?he pleaded. She pulled her head
back from the edge of the cliff. After a moment he called, “Saphira?” Above him were only swaying
trees. “Saphira! Come back!” he roared.
With a loud crash Saphira barreled off the top of the cliff, flipping around in midair. She floated down to

Eragon like a huge bat and grabbed his shirt with her claws, scratching his back. He let go of the rocks as
she yanked him up in the air. After a brief flight, she set him down gently on the top of the cliff and tugged
her claws out of his shirt.
Foolishness,said Saphira gently.
Eragon looked away, studying the landscape. The cliff provided a wonderful view of their surroundings,
especially the foaming sea, as well as protection against unwelcome eyes. Only birds would see Saphira
here. It was an ideal location.
Is Brom’s friend trustworthy?she asked.
I don’t know.Eragon proceeded to recount the day’s events.There are forces circling us that we aren’t
aware of. Sometimes I wonder if we can ever understand the true motives of the people around us. They
all seem to have secrets.
It is the way of the world. Ignore all the schemes and trust in the nature of each person. Brom is good.
He means us no harm. We don’t have to fear his plans.
I hope so,he said, looking down at his hands.
This finding of the Ra’zac through writing is a strange way of tracking,she remarked.Would there be a
way to use magic to see the records without being inside the room?
I’m not sure. You would have to combine the word forseeingwithdistance…or maybe lightanddistance.
Either way, it seems rather difficult. I’ll ask Brom.
That would be wise.They lapsed into tranquil silence.
You know, we may have to stay here awhile.
Saphira’s answer held a hard edge.And as always, I will be left to wait outside.
That is not how I want it. Soon enough we will travel together again.
May that day come quickly.
Eragon smiled and hugged her. He noticed then how rapidly the light was fading.I have to go now,
before I’m locked out of Teirm. Hunt tomorrow, and I will see you in the evening.
She spread her wings.Come, I will take you down. He got onto her scaly back and held on tightly as she
launched off the cliff, glided over the trees, then landed on a knoll. Eragon thanked her and ran back to
Teirm.
He came into sight of the portcullis just as it was beginning to lower. Calling for them to wait, he put on a
burst of speed and slipped inside seconds before the gateway slammed closed. “Ya cut that a little
close,” observed one of the guards.
“It won’t happen again,” assured Eragon, bending over to catch his breath. He wound his way through
the darkened city to Jeod’s house. A lantern hung outside like a beacon.

A plump butler answered his knock and ushered him inside without a word. Tapestries covered the
stone walls. Elaborate rugs dotted the polished wood floor, which glowed with the light from three gold
candelabra hanging from the ceiling. Smoke drifted through the air and collected above.
“This way, sir. Your friend is in the study.”
They passed scores of doorways until the butler opened one to reveal a study. Books covered the
room’s walls. But unlike those in Jeod’s office, these came in every size and shape. A fireplace filled with
blazing logs warmed the room. Brom and Jeod sat before an oval writing desk, talking amiably. Brom
raised his pipe and said in a jovial voice, “Ah, here you are. We were getting worried about you. How
was your walk?”
I wonder what put him in such a good mood? Why doesn’t he just come out and ask how Saphira is?
“Pleasant, but the guards almost locked me outside the city. And Teirm is big. I had trouble finding this
house.”
Jeod chuckled. “When you have seen Dras-Leona, Gil’ead, or even Kuasta, you won’t be so easily
impressed by this small ocean city. I like it here, though. When it’s not raining, Teirm is really quite
beautiful.”
Eragon turned to Brom. “Do you have any idea how long we’ll be here?”
Brom spread his palms upward. “That’s hard to tell. It depends on whether we can get to the records
and how long it will take us to find what we need. We’ll all have to help; it will be a huge job. I’ll talk
with Brand tomorrow and see if he’ll let us examine the records.”
“I don’t think I’ll be able to help,” Eragon said, shifting uneasily.
“Why not?” asked Brom. “There will be plenty of work for you.”
Eragon lowered his head. “I can’t read.”
Brom straightened with disbelief. “You mean Garrow never taught you?”
“He knew how to read?” asked Eragon, puzzled. Jeod watched them with interest.
“Of course he did,” snorted Brom. “The proud fool—what was he thinking? I should have realized that
he wouldn’t have taught you. He probably considered it an unnecessary luxury.” Brom scowled and
pulled at his beard angrily. “This sets my plans back, but not irreparably. I’ll just have to teach you how
to read. It won’t take long if you put your mind to it.”
Eragon winced. Brom’s lessons were usually intense and brutally direct.How much more can I learn at
one time? “I suppose it’s necessary,” he said ruefully.
“You’ll enjoy it. There is much you can learn from books and scrolls,” said Jeod. He gestured at the
walls. “These books are my friends, my companions. They make me laugh and cry and find meaning in
life.”
“It sounds intriguing,” admitted Eragon.
“Always the scholar, aren’t you?” asked Brom.

Page 116

Jeod shrugged. “Not anymore. I’m afraid I’ve degenerated into a bibliophile.”
“A what?” asked Eragon.
“One who loves books,” explained Jeod, and resumed conversing with Brom. Bored, Eragon scanned
the shelves. An elegant book set with gold studs caught his attention. He pulled it off the shelf and stared
at it curiously.
It was bound in black leather carved with mysterious runes. Eragon ran his fingers over the cover and
savored its cool smoothness. The letters inside were printed with a reddish glossy ink. He let the pages
slip past his fingers. A column of script, set off from the regular lettering, caught his eye. The words were
long and flowing, full of graceful lines and sharp points.
Eragon took the book to Brom. “What is this?” he asked, pointing to the strange writing.
Brom looked at the page closely and raised his eyebrows in surprise. “Jeod, you’ve expanded your
collection. Where did you get this? I haven’t seen one in ages.”
Jeod strained his neck to see the book. “Ah yes, theDomia abr Wyrda. A man came through here a few
years ago and tried to sell it to a trader down by the wharves. Fortunately, I happened to be there and
was able to save the book, along with his neck. He didn’t have a clue what it was.”
“It’s odd, Eragon, that you should pick up this book, theDominance of Fate, ” said Brom. “Of all the
items in this house, it’s probably worth the most. It details a complete history of Alagaësia—starting long
before the elves landed here and ending a few decades ago. The book is very rare and is the best of its
kind. When it was written, the Empire decried it as blasphemy and burned the author, Heslant the Monk.
I didn’t think any copies still existed. The lettering you asked about is from the ancient language.”
“What does it say?” asked Eragon.
It took Brom a moment to read the writing. “It’s part of an elven poem that tells of the years they fought
the dragons. This excerpt describes one of their kings, Ceranthor, as he rides into battle. The elves love
this poem and tell it regularly—though you need three days to do it properly—so that they won’t repeat
the mistakes of the past. At times they sing it so beautifully it seems the very rocks will cry.”
Eragon returned to his chair, holding the book gently.It’s amazing that a man who is dead can talk to
people through these pages. As long as this book survives, his ideas live. I wonder if it contains any
information about the Ra’zac?
He browsed through the book while Brom and Jeod spoke. Hours passed, and Eragon began to
drowse. Out of pity for his exhaustion, Jeod bid them good night. “The butler will show you to your
rooms.”
On the way upstairs, the servant said, “If you need assistance, use the bellpull next to the bed.” He
stopped before a cluster of three doors, bowed, then backed away.
As Brom entered the room on the right, Eragon asked, “Can I talk to you?”
“You just did, but come in anyway.”

Page 117

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Eragon closed the door behind himself. “Saphira and I had an idea. Is there—”
Brom stopped him with a raised hand and pulled the curtains shut over the window. “When you talk of
such things, you would do well to make sure that no unwelcome ears are present.”
“Sorry,” said Eragon, berating himself for the slip. “Anyway, is it possible to conjure up an image of
something that you can’t see?”
Brom sat on the edge of his bed. “What you are talking about is called scrying. It is quite possible and
extremely helpful in some situations, but it has a major drawback. You can only observe people, places,
and things that you’ve already seen. If you were to scry the Ra’zac, you’d see them all right, but not their
surroundings. There are other problems as well. Let’s say that you wanted to view a page in a book, one
that you’d already seen. You could only see the page if the book were open to it. If the book were
closed when you tried this, the page would appear completely black.”
“Why can’t you view objects that you haven’t seen?” asked Eragon. Even with those limitations, he
realized, scrying could be very useful.I wonder if I could view something leagues away and use magic to
affect what was happening there?
“Because,” said Brom patiently, “to scry, you have to know what you’re looking at and where to direct
your power. Even if a stranger was described to you, it would still be nigh impossible to view him, not to
mention the ground and whatever else might be around him. You have to knowwhat you’re going to scry
before youcan scry it. Does that answer your question?”
Eragon thought for a moment. “But how is it done? Do you conjure up the image in thin air?”
“Not usually,” said Brom, shaking his white head. “That takes more energy than projecting it onto a
reflective surface like a pool of water or a mirror. Some Riders used to travel everywhere they could,
trying to see as much as possible. Then, whenever war or some other calamity occurred, they would be
able to view events throughout Alagaësia.”
“May I try it?” asked Eragon.
Brom looked at him carefully. “No, not now. You’re tired, and scrying takes lots of strength. I will tell
you the words, but you must promise not to attempt it tonight. And I’d rather you wait until we leave
Teirm; I have more to teach you.”
Eragon smiled. “I promise.”
“Very well.” Brom bent over and very quietly whispered, “Draumr kópa” into Eragon’s ear.
Eragon took a moment to memorize the words. “Maybe after we’ve left Teirm, I can scry Roran. I
would like to know how he’s doing. I’m afraid that the Ra’zac might go after him.”
“I don’t mean to frighten you, but that’s a distinct possibility,” said Brom. “Although Roran was gone
most of the time the Ra’zac were in Carvahall, I’m sure that they asked questions about him. Who
knows, they may have even met him while they were in Therinsford. Either way, I doubt their curiosity is
sated. You’re on the loose, after all, and the king is probably threatening them with terrible punishment if
you aren’t found. If they get frustrated enough, they’ll go back and interrogate Roran. It’s only a matter
of time.”

Page 118

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“If that’s true, then the only way to keep Roran safe is to let the Ra’zac know where I am so that they’ll
come after me instead of him.”
“No, that won’t work either. You’re not thinking,” admonished Brom. “If you can’t understand your
enemies, how can you expect to anticipate them? Even if you exposed your location, the Ra’zac would
still chase Roran. Do you know why?”
Eragon straightened and tried to consider every possibility. “Well, if I stay in hiding long enough, they
might get frustrated and capture Roran to force me to reveal myself. If that didn’t work, they’d kill him
just to hurt me. Also, if I become a public enemy of the Empire, they might use him as bait to catch me.
And if I met with Roran and they found out about it, they would torture him to find out where I was.”
“Very good. You figured that out quite nicely,” said Brom.
“But what’s the solution? I can’t let him be killed!”
Brom clasped his hands loosely. “The solution is quite obvious. Roran is going to have to learn how to
defend himself. That may sound hard-hearted, but as you pointed out, you cannot risk meeting with him.
You may not remember this—you were half delirious at the time—but when we left Carvahall, I told you
that I had left a warning letter for Roran so he won’t be totally unprepared for danger. If he has any sense
at all, when the Ra’zac show up in Carvahall again, he’ll take my advice and flee.”
“I don’t like this,” said Eragon unhappily.
“Ah, but you forget something.”
“What?” he demanded.
“There is some good in all of this. The king cannot afford to have a Rider roaming around that he does
not control. Galbatorix is the only known Rider alive besides yourself, but he would like another one
under his command. Before he tries to kill you or Roran, he will offer you the chance to serve him.
Unfortunately, if he ever gets close enough to make that proposition, it will be far too late for you to
refuse and still live.”
“You call that some good!”
“It’s all that’s protecting Roran. As long as the king doesn’t know which side you’ve chosen, he won’t
risk alienating you by harming your cousin. Keep that firmly in mind. The Ra’zac killed Garrow, but I
think it was an ill-considered decision on their part. From what I know of Galbatorix, he would not have
approved it unless he gained something from it.”
“And how will I be able to deny the king’s wishes when he is threatening me with death?” asked Eragon
sharply.
Brom sighed. He went to his nightstand and dipped his fingers in a basin of rose water. “Galbatorix
wants your willing cooperation. Without that, you’re worse than useless to him. So the question
becomes, If you are ever faced with this choice, are you willing to die for what you believe in? For that is
the only way you will deny him.”
The question hung in the air.

Page 119

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Brom finally said, “It’s a difficult question and not one you can answer until you’re faced with it. Keep in
mind that many people have died for their beliefs; it’s actually quite common. The real courage is in living
and suffering for what you believe.”
THEWITCH AND THEWERECAT
It was late in the morning when Eragon woke. He dressed, washed his face in the basin, then held the
mirror up and brushed his hair into place. Something about his reflection made him stop and look closer.
His face had changed since he had run out of Carvahall just a short while ago. Any baby fat was gone
now, stripped away by traveling, sparring, and training. His cheekbones were more prominent, and the
line of his jaw was sharper. There was a slight cast to his eyes that, when he looked closely, gave his face
a wild, alien appearance. He held the mirror at arm’s length, and his face resumed its normal
semblance—but it still did not seem quite his own.
A little disturbed, he slung his bow and quiver across his back, then left the room. Before he had
reached the end of the hall, the butler caught up with him and said, “Sir, Neal left with my master for the
castle earlier. He said that you could do whatever you want today because he will not return until this
evening.”
Eragon thanked him for the message, then eagerly began exploring Teirm. For hours he wandered the
streets, entering every shop that struck his fancy and chatting with various people. Eventually he was
forced back to Jeod’s by his empty stomach and lack of money.
When he reached the street where the merchant lived, he stopped at the herbalist’s shop next door. It
was an unusual place for a store. The other shops were down by the city wall, not crammed between
expensive houses. He tried to look in the windows, but they were covered with a thick layer of crawling
plants on the interior. Curious, he went inside.
At first he saw nothing because the store was so dark, but then his eyes adjusted to the faint greenish
light that filtered through the windows. A colorful bird with wide tail feathers and a sharp, powerful beak
looked at Eragon inquisitively from a cage near the window. The walls were covered with plants; vines
clung to the ceiling, obscuring all but an old chandelier, and on the floor was a large pot with a yellow
flower. A collection of mortars, pestles, metal bowls, and a clear crystal ball the size of Eragon’s head
rested on a long counter.
He walked to the counter, carefully stepping around complex machines, crates of rocks, piles of scrolls,
and other objects he did not recognize. The wall behind the counter was covered with drawers of every
size. Some of them were no larger than his smallest finger, while others were big enough for a barrel.
There was a foot-wide gap in the shelves far above.
A pair of red eyes suddenly flashed from the dark space, and a large, fierce cat leapt onto the counter. It
had a lean body with powerful shoulders and oversized paws. A shaggy mane surrounded its angular
face; its ears were tipped with black tufts. White fangs curved down over its jaw. Altogether, it did not
look like any cat Eragon had ever seen. It inspected him with shrewd eyes, then flicked its tail
dismissively.
On a whim, Eragon reached out with his mind and touched the cat’s consciousness. Gently, he prodded
it with his thoughts, trying to make it understand that he was a friend.
You don’t have to do that.

Page 120

Eragon looked around in alarm. The cat ignored him and licked a paw.Saphira? Where are you? he
asked. No one answered. Puzzled, he leaned against the counter and reached for what looked like a
wood rod.
That wouldn’t be wise.
Stop playing games, Saphira,he snapped, then picked up the rod. A shock of electricity exploded
through his body, and he fell to the floor, writhing. The pain slowly faded, leaving him gasping for air. The
cat jumped down and looked at him.
You aren’t very smart for a Dragon Rider. I did warn you.
You said that!exclaimed Eragon. The cat yawned, then stretched and sauntered across the floor,
weaving its way between objects.
Who else?
But you’re just a cat!he objected.
The cat yowled and stalked back to him. It jumped on his chest and crouched there, looking down at
him with gleaming eyes. Eragon tried to sit up, but it growled, showing its fangs.Do I look like other cats?
No…
Then what makes you think I am one?Eragon started to say something, but the creature dug its claws
into his chest.Obviously your education has been neglected. I—to correct your mistake—am a werecat.
There aren’t many of us left, but I think even a farm boy should have heard of us.
I didn’t know you were real,said Eragon, fascinated. A werecat! He was indeed fortunate. They were
always flitting around the edges of stories, keeping to themselves and occasionally giving advice. If the
legends were true, they had magical powers, lived longer than humans, and usually knew more than they
told.
The werecat blinked lazily.Knowing is independent of being. I did not know you existed before you
bumbled in here and ruined my nap. Yet that doesn’t mean you weren’t real before you woke me.
Eragon was lost by its reasoning.I’m sorry I disturbed you.
I was getting up anyway,it said. It leapt back onto the counter and licked its paw.If I were you, I
wouldn’t hold on to that rod much longer. It’s going to shock you again in a few seconds.
He hastily put the rod back where he had found it.What is it?
A common and boring artifact, unlike myself.
But what’s it for?
Didn’t you find out?The werecat finished cleaning its paw, stretched once more, then jumped back up to
its sleeping place. It sat down, tucked its paws under its breast, and closed its eyes, purring.
Wait,said Eragon,what’s your name?

Page 121

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

One of the werecat’s slanted eyes cracked open.I go by many names. If you are looking for my proper
one, you will have to seek elsewhere. The eye closed. Eragon gave up and turned to leave.However, you
may call me Solembum.
Thank you,said Eragon seriously. Solembum’s purring grew louder.
The door to the shop swung open, letting in a beam of sunlight. Angela entered with a cloth bag full of
plants. Her eyes flickered at Solembum and she looked startled. “He says you talked with him.”
“You can talk with him, too?” asked Eragon.
She tossed her head. “Of course, but that doesn’t mean he’ll say anything back.” She set her plants on
the counter, then walked behind it and faced him. “He likes you. That’s unusual. Most of the time
Solembum doesn’t show himself to customers. In fact, he says that you show some promise, given a few
years of work.”
“Thanks.”
“It’s a compliment, coming from him. You’re only the third person to come in here who has been able to
speak with him. The first was a woman, many years ago; the second was a blind beggar; and now you.
But I don’t run a store just so I can prattle on. Is there anything you want? Or did you only come in to
look?”
“Just to look,” said Eragon, still thinking about the werecat. “Besides, I don’t really need any herbs.”
“That’s not all I do,” said Angela with a grin. “The rich fool lords pay me for love potions and the like. I
never claim that they work, but for some reason they keep coming back. But I don’t think you need
those chicaneries. Would you like your fortune told? I do that, too, for all the rich fool ladies.”
Eragon laughed. “No, I’m afraid my fortune is pretty much unreadable. And I don’t have any money.”
Angela looked at Solembum curiously. “I think…” She gestured at the crystal ball resting on the counter.
“That’s only for show anyway—it doesn’t do anything. But I do have… Wait here; I’ll be right back.”
She hurried into a room at the back of the shop.
She came back, breathless, holding a leather pouch, which she set on the counter. “I haven’t used these
for so long, I almost forgot where they were. Now, sit across from me and I’ll show you why I went to
all this trouble.” Eragon found a stool and sat. Solembum’s eyes glowed from the gap in the drawers.
Angela laid a thick cloth on the counter, then poured a handful of smooth bones, each slightly longer than
a finger, onto it. Runes and symbols were inscribed along their sides. “These,” she said, touching them
gently, “are the knucklebones of a dragon. Don’t ask where I got them; it is a secret I won’t reveal. But
unlike tea leaves, crystal balls, or even divining cards, these have true power. They do not lie, though
understanding what they say is… complicated. If you wish, I will cast and read them for you. But
understand that to know one’s fate can be a terrible thing. You must be sure of your decision.”
Eragon looked at the bones with a feeling of dread.There lies what was once one of Saphira’s kin. To
know one’s fate… How can I make this decision when I don’t know what lies in wait for me and
whether I will like it? Ignorance is indeed bliss. “Why do you offer this?” he asked.

Page 122

“Because of Solembum. He may have been rude, but the fact that he spoke to you makes you special.
Heis a werecat, after all. I offered to do this for the other two people who talked with him. Only the
woman agreed to it. Selena was her name. Ah, she regretted it, too. Her fortune was bleak and painful. I
don’t think she believed it—not at first.”
Emotion overcame Eragon, bringing tears to his eyes. “Selena,” he whispered to himself. His mother’s
name.Could it have been her? Was her destiny so horrible that she had to abandon me? “Do you
remember anything about her fortune?” he asked, feeling sick.
Angela shook her head and sighed. “It was so long ago that the details have melted into the rest of my
memory, which isn’t as good as it used to be. Besides, I’ll not tell you what I do remember. That was for
her and her alone. It was sad, though; I’ve never forgotten the look on her face.”
Eragon closed his eyes and struggled to regain control of his emotions. “Why do you complain about
your memory?” he asked to distract himself. “You’re not that old.”
Dimples appeared on Angela’s cheeks. “I’m flattered, but don’t be deceived; I’m much older than I
look. The appearance of youth probably comes from having to eat my own herbs when times are lean.”
Smiling, Eragon took a deep breath.If that was my mother and she could bear to have her fortune told, I
can too. “Cast the bones for me,” he said solemnly.
Angela’s face became grave as she grasped the bones in each hand. Her eyes closed, and her lips
moved in a soundless murmur. Then she said powerfully,“Manin! Wyrda! Hugin!” and tossed the bones
onto the cloth. They fell all jumbled together, gleaming in the faint light.
The words rang in Eragon’s ears; he recognized them from the ancient language and realized with
apprehension that to use them for magic, Angela must be a witch. She had not lied; this was a true
fortunetelling. Minutes slowly passed as she studied the bones.
Finally, Angela leaned back and heaved a long sigh. She wiped her brow and pulled out a wineskin from
under the counter. “Do you want some?” she asked. Eragon shook his head. She shrugged and drank
deeply. “This,” she said, wiping her mouth, “is the hardest reading I’ve ever done. You were right. Your
future is nigh impossible to see. I’ve never known of anyone’s fate being so tangled and clouded. I was,
however, able to wrestle a few answers from it.”
Solembum jumped onto the counter and settled there, watching them both. Eragon clenched his hands as
Angela pointed to one of the bones. “I will start here,” she said slowly, “because it is the clearest to
understand.”
The symbol on the bone was a long horizontal line with a circle resting on it. “Infinity or long life,” said
Angela quietly. “This is the first time I have ever seen it come up in someone’s future. Most of the time
it’s the aspen or the elm, both signs that a person will live a normal span of years. Whether this means
that you will live forever or that you will only have an extraordinarily long life, I’m not sure. Whatever it
foretells, you may be sure that many years lie ahead of you.”
No surprises there—I am a Rider,thought Eragon. Was Angela only going to tell him things he already
knew?
“Now the bones grow harder to read, as the rest are in a confused pile.” Angela touched three of them.
“Here the wandering path, lightning bolt, and sailing ship all lie together—a pattern I’ve never seen, only

Page 123

heard of. The wandering path shows that there are many choices in your future, some of which you face
even now. I see great battles raging around you, some of them fought for your sake. I see the mighty
powers of this land struggling to control your will and destiny. Countless possible futures await you—all
of them filled with blood and conflict—but only one will bring you happiness and peace. Beware of losing
your way, for you are one of the few who are truly free to choose their own fate. That freedom is a gift,
but it is also a responsibility more binding than chains.”
Then her face grew sad. “And yet, as if to counteract that, here is the lightning bolt. It is a terrible omen.
There is a doom upon you, but of what sort I know not. Part of it lies in a death—one that rapidly
approaches and will cause you much grief. But the rest awaits in a great journey. Look closely at this
bone. You can see how its end rests on that of the sailing ship. That is impossible to misunderstand. Your
fate will be to leave this land forever. Where you will end up I know not, but you will never again stand in
Alagaësia. This is inescapable. It will come to pass even if you try to avoid it.”
Her words frightened Eragon.Another death… who must I lose now? His thoughts immediately went to
Roran. Then he thought about his homeland.What could ever force me to leave? And where would I go?
If there are lands across the sea or to the east, only the elves know of them.
Angela rubbed her temples and breathed deeply. “The next bone is easier to read and perhaps a bit
more pleasant.” Eragon examined it and saw a rose blossom inscribed between the horns of a crescent
moon.
Angela smiled and said, “An epic romance is in your future, extraordinary, as the moon indicates—for
that is a magical symbol—and strong enough to outlast empires. I cannot say if this passion will end
happily, but your love is of noble birth and heritage. She is powerful, wise, and beautiful beyond
compare.”
Of noble birth,thought Eragon in surprise.How could that ever happen? I have no more standing than the
poorest of farmers.
“Now for the last two bones, the tree and the hawthorn root, which cross each other strongly. I wish
that this were not so—it can only mean more trouble—but betrayal is clear. And it will come from within
your family.”
“Roran wouldn’t do that!” objected Eragon abruptly.
“I wouldn’t know,” said Angela carefully. “But the bones have never lied, and that is what they say.”
Doubt wormed into Eragon’s mind, but he tried to ignore it. What reason would there ever be for Roran
to turn on him? Angela put a comforting hand on his shoulder and offered him the wineskin again. This
time Eragon accepted the drink, and it made him feel better.
“After all that, death might be welcome,” he joked nervously.Betrayal from Roran? It couldn’t happen!
It won’t!
“It might be,” said Angela solemnly, then laughed slightly. “But you shouldn’t fret about what has yet to
occur. The only way the future can harm us is by causing worry. I guarantee that you’ll feel better once
you’re out in the sun.”
“Perhaps.”Unfortunately, he reflected wryly,nothing she said will make sense until it has already
happened. If it really does,he amended himself. “You used words of power,” he noted quietly.

Angela’s eyes flashed. “What I wouldn’t give to see how the rest of your life plays out. You can speak
to werecats, know of the ancient language, and have a most interesting future. Also, few young men with
empty pockets and rough traveling clothes can expect to be loved by a noblewoman. Who are you?”
Eragon realized that the werecat must not have told Angela that he was a Rider. He almost said, “Evan,”
but then changed his mind and simply stated, “I am Eragon.”
Angela arched her eyebrows. “Is that who you are or your name?” she asked.
“Both,” said Eragon with a small smile, thinking of his namesake, the first Rider.
“Now I’m all the more interested in seeing how your life will unfold. Who was the ragged man with you
yesterday?”
Eragon decided that one more name couldn’t hurt. “His name is Brom.”
A guffaw suddenly burst out of Angela, doubling her over in mirth. She wiped her eyes and took a sip of
wine, then fought off another attack of merriment. Finally, gasping for breath, she forced out, “Oh… that
one! I had no idea!”
“What is it?” demanded Eragon.
“No, no, don’t be upset,” said Angela, hiding a smile. “It’s only that—well, he is known by those in my
profession. I’m afraid that the poor man’s doom, or future if you will, is something of a joke with us.”
“Don’t insult him! He’s a better man than any you could find!” snapped Eragon.
“Peace, peace,” chided Angela with amusement. “I know that. If we meet again at the right time I’ll be
sure to tell you about it. But in the meantime you should—” She stopped speaking as Solembum padded
between them. The werecat stared at Eragon with unblinking eyes.
Yes?Eragon asked, irritated.
Listen closely and I will tell you two things. When the time comes and you need a weapon, look under
the roots of the Menoa tree. Then, when all seems lost and your power is insufficient, go to the rock of
Kuthian and speak your name to open the Vault of Souls.
Before Eragon could ask what Solembum meant, the werecat walked away, waving his tail ever so
gracefully. Angela tilted her head, coils of dense hair shadowing her forehead. “I don’t know what he
said, and I don’t want to know. He spoke to you and only you. Don’t tell anyone else.”
“I think I have to go,” said Eragon, shaken.
“If you want to,” said Angela, smiling again. “You are welcome to stay here as long as you like,
especially if you buy some of my goods. But go if you wish; I’m sure that we’ve given you enough to
ponder for a while.”
“Yes.” Eragon quickly made his way to the door. “Thank you for reading my future.”I think.
“You’re welcome,” said Angela, still smiling.

Eragon exited the shop and stood in the street, squinting until his eyes adjusted to the brightness. It was a
few minutes before he could think calmly about what he had learned. He started walking, his steps
unconsciously quickening until he dashed out of Teirm, feet flying as he headed to Saphira’s hiding place.
He called to her from the base of the cliff. A minute later she soared down and bore him up to the cliff
top. When they were both safely on the ground, Eragon told her about his day.And so, he concluded,I
think Brom’s right; I always seem to be where there’s trouble.
You should remember what the werecat told you. It’s important.
How do you know?he asked curiously.
I’m not sure, but the names he used feel powerful.Kuthian, she said, rolling the word around.No, we
should not forget what he said.
Do you think I should tell Brom?
It’s your choice, but think of this: he has no right to know your future. To tell him of Solembum and his
words will only raise questions you may not want to answer. And if you decided to only ask him what
those words mean, he will want to know where you learned them. Do you think you can lie convincingly
to him?
No,admitted Eragon.Maybe I won’t say anything. Still, this might be too important to hide. They talked
until there was nothing more to say. Then they sat together companionably, watching the trees until dusk.
Eragon hurried back to Teirm and was soon knocking on Jeod’s door. “Is Neal back?” he asked the
butler.
“Yes sir. I believe he’s in the study right now.”
“Thank you,” said Eragon. He strode to the room and peeked inside. Brom was sitting before the fire,
smoking. “How did it go?” asked Eragon.
“Bloody awful!” growled Brom around his pipe.
“So you talked to Brand?”
“Not that it did any good. Thisadministrator of trade is the worst sort of bureaucrat. He abides by every
rule, delights in making his own whenever it can inconvenience someone, and at the same time believes
that he’s doing good.”
“Then he won’t let us see the records?” asked Eragon.
“No,” snapped Brom, exasperated. “Nothing I could say would sway him. He even refused bribes!
Substantial ones, too. I didn’t think I would ever meet a noble who wasn’t corrupt. Now that I have, I
find that I prefer them when they’re greedy bastards.” He puffed furiously on his pipe and mumbled a
steady stream of curses.
When he seemed to have calmed, Eragon asked tentatively, “So, what now?”

Page 126

“I’m going to take the next week and teach you how to read.”
“And after that?”
A smile split Brom’s face. “After that, we’re going to give Brand a nasty surprise.” Eragon pestered him
for details, but Brom refused to say more.
Dinner was held in a sumptuous dining room. Jeod sat at one end of the table, a hard-eyed Helen at the
other. Brom and Eragon were seated between them, which Eragon felt was a dangerous place to be.
Empty chairs were on either side of him, but he didn’t mind the space. It helped to protect him from the
glares of their hostess.
The food was served quietly, and Jeod and Helen wordlessly began eating. Eragon followed suit,
thinking,I’ve had cheerier meals at funerals.And he had, in Carvahall. He remembered many burials that
had been sad, yes, but not unduly so. This was different; he could feel simmering resentment pouring from
Helen throughout the dinner.
OFREADING ANDPLOTS
Brom scratched a rune on parchment with charcoal, then showed it to Eragon. “This is the lettera, ” he
said. “Learn it.”
With that, Eragon began the task of becoming literate. It was difficult and strange and pushed his intellect
to its limits, but he enjoyed it. Without anything else to do and with a good—if sometimes
impatient—teacher, he advanced rapidly.
A routine was soon established. Every day Eragon got up, ate in the kitchen, then went to the study for
his lessons, where he labored to memorize the sounds of the letters and the rules of writing. It got so that
when he closed his eyes, letters and words danced in his mind. He thought of little else during that time.
Before dinner, he and Brom would go behind Jeod’s house and spar. The servants, along with a small
crowd of wide-eyed children, would come and watch. If there was any time afterward, Eragon would
practice magic in his room, with the curtains securely closed.
His only worry was Saphira. He visited her every evening, but it was not enough time together for either
of them. During the day, Saphira spent most of her time leagues away searching for food; she could not
hunt near Teirm without arousing suspicion. Eragon did what he could to help her, but he knew that the
only solution for both her hunger and loneliness was to leave the city far behind.
Every day more grim news poured into Teirm. Arriving merchants told of horrific attacks along the
coast. There were reports of powerful people disappearing from their houses in the night and their
mangled corpses being discovered in the morning. Eragon often heard Brom and Jeod discussing the
events in an undertone, but they always stopped when he came near.
The days passed quickly, and soon a week had gone by. Eragon’s skills were rudimentary, but he could
now read whole pages without asking Brom’s help. He read slowly, but he knew that speed would come
with time. Brom encouraged him, “No matter, you’ll do fine for what I have planned.”
It was afternoon when Brom summoned both Jeod and Eragon to the study. Brom gestured at Eragon.
“Now that you can help us, I think it’s time to move ahead.”

Page 127

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“What do you have in mind?” asked Eragon.
A fierce smile danced on Brom’s face. Jeod groaned. “I know that look; it’s what got us into trouble in
the first place.”
“A slight exaggeration,” said Brom, “but not unwarranted. Very well, this is what we’ll do…”

We leave tonight or tomorrow,Eragon told Saphira from within his room.
This is unexpected. Will you be safe during this venture?
Eragon shrugged.I don’t know. We may end up fleeing Teirm with soldiers on our heels. He felt her
worry and tried to reassure her.It’ll be all right. Brom and I can use magic, and we’re good fighters.
He lay on the bed and stared at the ceiling. His hands shook slightly, and there was a lump in his throat.
As sleep overcame him, he felt a wave of confusion.I don’t want to leave Teirm, he suddenly realized.
The time I’ve spent here has been—almost normal. What I would give not to keep uprooting myself. To
stay here and be like everyone else would be wonderful. Then, another thought raged through him,But I’ll
never be able to while Saphira is around. Never.
Dreams owned his consciousness, twisting and directing it to their whims. At times he quaked with fear;
at others he laughed with pleasure. Then something changed—it was as though his eyes had been opened
for the first time—and a dream came to him that was clearer than any before.
He saw a young woman, bent over by sorrow, chained in a cold, hard cell. A beam of moonlight shone
through a barred window set high in the wall and fell on her face. A single tear rolled down her cheek,
like a liquid diamond.
Eragon rose with a start and found himself crying uncontrollably before sinking back into a fitful sleep.
THIEVES IN THECASTLE
Eragon woke from his nap to a golden sunset. Red and orange beams of light streamed into the room
and fell across the bed. They warmed his back pleasantly, making him reluctant to move. He dozed, but
the sunlight crept off him, and he grew cold. The sun sank below the horizon, lighting the sea and sky with
color.Almost time!
He slung his bow and quiver on his back, but left Zar’roc in the room; the sword would only slow him,
and he was averse to using it. If he had to disable someone, he could use magic or an arrow. He pulled
his jerkin over his shirt and laced it securely.
He waited nervously in his room until the light faded. Then he entered the hallway and shrugged so the
quiver settled comfortably across his back. Brom joined him, carrying his sword and staff.
Jeod, dressed in a black doublet and hose, was waiting for them outside. From his waist swung an
elegant rapier and a leather pouch. Brom eyed the rapier and observed, “That toad sticker is too thin for
any real fighting. What will you do if someone comes after you with a broadsword or a flamberge?”
“Be realistic,” said Jeod. “None of the guards has a flamberge. Besides, thistoad sticker is faster than a

Page 128

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

broadsword.”
Brom shrugged. “It’s your neck.”
They walked casually along the street, avoiding watchmen and soldiers. Eragon was tense and his heart
pounded. As they passed Angela’s shop, a flash of movement on the roof caught his attention, but he
saw no one. His palm tingled. He looked at the roof again, but it was still empty.
Brom led them along Teirm’s outer wall. By the time they reached the castle, the sky was black. The
sealed walls of the fortress made Eragon shiver. He would hate to be imprisoned there. Jeod silently took
the lead and strode up to the gates, trying to look at ease. He pounded on the gate and waited.
A small grille slid open and a surly guard peered out. “Ya?” he grunted shortly. Eragon could smell rum
on his breath.
“We need to get in,” said Jeod.
The guard peered at Jeod closer. “Wha’ for?”
“The boy here left something very valuable in my office. We have to retrieve it immediately.” Eragon
hung his head, shamefaced.
The guard frowned, clearly impatient to get back to his bottle. “Ah, wha’ever,” he said, swinging his
arm. “Jus’ make sure ’n give ’im a good beating f’r me.”
“I’ll do that,” assured Jeod as the guard unbolted a small door set into the gate. They entered the keep,
then Brom handed the guard a few coins.
“Thank’ee,” mumbled the man, tottering away. As soon as he was gone, Eragon pulled his bow from its
tube and strung it. Jeod quickly let them into the main part of the castle. They hurried toward their
destination, listening carefully for any soldiers on patrol. At the records room, Brom tried the door. It was
locked. He put his hand against the door and muttered a word that Eragon did not recognize. It swung
open with a faint click. Brom grabbed a torch from the wall, and they darted inside, closing the door
quietly.
The squat room was filled with wooden racks piled high with scrolls. A barred window was set in the far
wall. Jeod threaded his way between the racks, running his eyes over the scrolls. He halted at the back of
the room. “Over here,” he said. “These are the shipping records for the past five years. You can tell the
date by the wax seals on the corner.”
“So what do we do now?” asked Eragon, pleased that they had made it so far without being discovered.
“Start at the top and work down,” said Jeod. “Some scrolls only deal with taxes. You can ignore those.
Look for anything that mentions Seithr oil.” He took a length of parchment from his pouch and stretched
it out on the floor, then set a bottle of ink and a quill pen next to it. “So we can keep track of whatever
we find,” he explained.
Brom scooped an armful of scrolls from the top of the rack and piled them on the floor. He sat and
unrolled the first one. Eragon joined him, positioning himself so he could see the door. The tedious work
was especially difficult for him, as the cramped script on the scrolls was different from the printing Brom
had taught him.

Page 129

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

By looking only for the names of ships that sailed in the northern areas, they winnowed out many of the
scrolls. Even so, they moved down the rack slowly, recording each shipment of Seithr oil as they located
it.
It was quiet outside the room, except for the occasional watchman. Suddenly, Eragon’s neck prickled.
He tried to keep working, but the uneasy feeling remained. Irritated, he looked up and jerked with
surprise—a small boy crouched on the windowsill. His eyes were slanted, and a sprig of holly was
woven into his shaggy black hair.
Do you need help?asked a voice in Eragon’s head. His eyes widened with shock. It sounded like
Solembum.
Is that you?he asked incredulously.
Am I someone else?
Eragon gulped and concentrated on his scroll. If my eyes don’t deceive me, you are.
The boy smiled slightly, revealing pointed teeth.What I look like doesn’t change who I am. You don’t
think I’m called a werecat for nothing, do you?
What are you doing here?Eragon asked.
The werecat tilted his head and considered whether the question was worth an answer.That depends on
what you are doing here. If you are reading those scrolls for entertainment, then I suppose there isn’t any
reason for my visit. But if what you are doing is unlawful and you don’t want to be discovered, I might be
here to warn you that the guard whom you bribed just told his replacement about you and that this
second official of the Empire has sent soldiers to search for you.
Thank you for telling me,said Eragon.
Told you something, did I? I suppose I did. And I suggest you make use of it.
The boy stood and tossed back his wild hair. Eragon asked quickly,What did you mean last time about
the tree and the vault?
Exactly what I said.
Eragon tried to ask more, but the werecat vanished through the window. He announced abruptly, “There
are soldiers looking for us.”
“How do you know?” asked Brom sharply.
“I listened in on the guard. His replacement just sent men to search for us. We have to get out of here.
They’ve probably already discovered that Jeod’s office is empty.”
“Are you sure?” asked Jeod.
“Yes!” said Eragon impatiently. “They’re on their way.”

Page 130

Brom snatched another scroll from the rack. “No matter. We have to finish this now!” They worked
furiously for the next minute, scanning the records as fast as they could. As the last scroll was finished,
Brom threw it back onto the rack, and Jeod jammed his parchment, ink, and pen into his pouch. Eragon
grabbed the torch.
They raced from the room and shut the door, but just as it closed they heard the heavy tramp of
soldiers’ boots at the end of the hall. They turned to leave, but Brom hissed furiously, “Damnation! It’s
not locked.” He put his hand against the door. The lock clicked at the same time three armed soldiers
came into view.
“Hey! Get away from that door!” shouted one of them. Brom stepped back, assuming a surprised
expression. The three men marched up to them. The tallest one demanded, “Why are you trying to get
into the records?” Eragon gripped his bow tighter and prepared to run.
“I’m afraid we lost our way.” The strain was evident in Jeod’s voice. A drop of sweat rolled down his
neck.
The soldier glared at them suspiciously. “Check inside the room,” he ordered one of his men.
Eragon held his breath as the soldier stepped up to the door, tried to open it, then pounded on it with his
mailed fist. “It’s locked, sir.”
The leader scratched his chin. “Ar’right, then. I don’t know what you were up to, but as long as the
door’s locked, I guess you’re free to go. Come on.” The soldiers surrounded them and marched them
back to the keep.
I can’t believe it,thought Eragon.They’re helping us get away!
At the main gates, the soldier pointed and said, “Now, you walk through those and don’t try anything.
We’ll be watching. If you have to come back, wait until morning.”
“Of course,” promised Jeod.
Eragon could feel the guards’ eyes boring into their backs as they hurried out of the castle. The moment
that the gates closed behind them, a triumphant grin stretched across his face, and he jumped into the air.
Brom shot him a cautioning look and growled, “Walk back to the house normally. You can celebrate
there.”
Chastised, Eragon adopted a staid demeanor, but inside he still bubbled with energy. Once they had
hurried back to the house and into the study, Eragon exclaimed, “We did it!”
“Yes, but now we have to figure out if it was worth the trouble,” said Brom. Jeod took a map of
Alagaësia from the shelves and unrolled it on the desk.
On the left side of the map, the ocean extended to the unknown west. Along the coast stretched the
Spine, an immense length of mountains. The Hadarac Desert filled the center of the map—the east end
was blank. Somewhere in that void hid the Varden. To the south was Surda, a small country that had
seceded from the Empire after the Riders’ fall. Eragon had been told that Surda secretly supported the
Varden.
Near Surda’s eastern border was a mountain range labeled Beor Mountains. Eragon had heard of them

Page 131

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

in many stories—they were supposed to be ten times the height of the Spine, though he privately believed
that was exaggeration. The map was empty to the east of the Beors.
Five islands rested off the coast of Surda: Nía, Parlim, Uden, Illium, and Beirland. Nía was no more than
an outcropping of rock, but Beirland, the largest, had a small town. Farther up, near Teirm, was a jagged
island called Sharktooth. And high to the north was one more island, immense and shaped like a knobby
hand. Eragon knew its name without even looking: Vroengard, the ancestral home of the Riders—once a
place of glory, but now a looted, empty shell haunted by strange beasts. In the center of Vroengard was
the abandoned city of Dorú Areaba.
Carvahall was a small dot at the top of Palancar Valley. Level with it, but across the plains, sprawled the
forest Du Weldenvarden. Like the Beor Mountains, its eastern end was unmapped. Parts of Du
Weldenvarden’s western edge had been settled, but its heart lay mysterious and unexplored. The forest
was wilder than the Spine; the few who braved its depths often came back raving mad, or not at all.
Eragon shivered as he saw Urû’baen in the center of the Empire. King Galbatorix ruled from there with
his black dragon, Shruikan, by his side. Eragon put his finger on Urû’baen. “The Ra’zac are sure to have
a hiding place here.”
“You had better hope that that isn’t their only sanctuary,” said Brom flatly. “Otherwise you’ll never get
near them.” He pushed the rustling map flat with his wrinkled hands.
Jeod took the parchment out of his pouch and said, “From what I saw in the records, there have been
shipments of Seithr oil to every major city in the Empire over the past five years. As far as I can tell, all of
them might have been ordered by wealthy jewelers. I’m not sure how we can narrow down the list
without more information.”
Brom swept a hand over the map. “I think we can eliminate some cities. The Ra’zac have to travel
wherever the king wants, and I’m sure he keeps them busy. If they’re expected to go anywhere at
anytime, the only reasonable place for them to stay is at a crossroads where they can reach every part of
the country fairly easily.” He was excited now and paced the room. “This crossroads has to be large
enough so the Ra’zac will be inconspicuous. It also has to have enough trade so any unusual
requests—special food for their mounts, for example—will go unnoticed.”
“That makes sense,” said Jeod, nodding. “Under those conditions, we can ignore most of the cities in the
north. The only big ones are Teirm, Gil’ead, and Ceunon. I know they’re not in Teirm, and I doubt that
the oil has been shipped farther up the coast to Narda—it’s too small. Ceunon is too isolated… only
Gil’ead remains.”
“The Ra’zac might be there,” conceded Brom. “It would have a certain irony.”
“It would at that,” Jeod acknowledged softly.
“What about southern cities?” asked Eragon.
“Well,” said Jeod. “There’s obviously Urû’baen, but that’s an unlikely destination. If someone were to
die from Seithr oil in Galbatorix’s court, it would be all too easy for an earl or some other lord to
discover that the Empire had been buying large amounts of it. That still leaves many others, any one of
which could be the one we want.”
“Yes,” said Eragon, “but the oil wasn’t sent to all of them. The parchment only lists Kuasta, Dras-Leona,

Page 132

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Aroughs, and Belatona. Kuasta wouldn’t work for the Ra’zac; it’s on the coast and surrounded by
mountains. Aroughs is isolated like Ceunon, though it is a center of trade. That leaves Belatona and
Dras-Leona, which are rather close together. Of the two, I think Dras-Leona is the likelier. It’s larger
and better situated.”
“And that’s where nearly all the goods of the Empire pass through at one time or another, including
Teirm’s,” said Jeod. “It would be a good place for the Ra’zac to hide.”
“So… Dras-Leona,” said Brom as he sat down and lit his pipe. “What do the records show?”
Jeod looked at the parchment. “Here it is. At the beginning of the year, three shipments of Seithr oil
were sent to Dras-Leona. Each shipment was only two weeks apart, and the records say they were all
transported by the same merchant. The same thing happened last year and the year before that. I doubt
any one jeweler, or even a group of them, has the money for so much oil.”
“What about Gil’ead?” asked Brom, raising an eyebrow.
“It doesn’t have the same access to the rest of the Empire. And,” Jeod tapped the parchment, “they’ve
only received the oil twice in recent years.” He thought for a moment, then said, “Besides, I think we
forgot something—Helgrind.”
Brom nodded. “Ah yes, the Dark Gates. It’s been many years since I’ve thought of it. You’re right, that
would make Dras-Leona perfect for the Ra’zac. I guess it’s decided, then; that’s where we’ll go.”
Eragon sat abruptly, too drained of emotion to even ask what Helgrind was.I thought I would be happy
to resume the hunt. Instead, I feel like an abyss has opened up before me. Dras-Leona! It’s so far
away…
The parchment crackled as Jeod slowly rolled up the map. He handed it to Brom and said, “You’ll need
this, I’m afraid. Your expeditions often take you into obscure regions.” Nodding, Brom accepted the
map. Jeod clapped him on the shoulder. “It doesn’t feel right that you will leave without me. My heart
expects to go along, but the rest of me reminds me of my age and responsibilities.”
“I know,” said Brom. “But you have a life in Teirm. It is time for the next generation to take up the
standard. You’ve done your part; be happy.”
“What of you?” asked Jeod. “Does the road ever end for you?”
A hollow laugh escaped Brom’s lips. “I see it coming, but not for a while.” He extinguished his pipe, and
they left for their rooms, exhausted. Before he fell asleep, Eragon contacted Saphira to relate the night’s
adventures.
ACOSTLYMISTAKE
In the morning Eragon and Brom retrieved their saddlebags from the stable and prepared to depart.
Jeod greeted Brom while Helen watched from the doorway. With grave looks, the two men clasped
hands. “I’ll miss you, old man,” said Jeod.
“And you I,” said Brom thickly. He bowed his white head and then turned to Helen. “Thank you for
your hospitality; it was most gracious.” Her face reddened. Eragon thought she was going to slap him.
Brom continued, unperturbed, “You have a good husband; take care of him. There are few men as brave

Page 133

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

and as determined as he is. But even he cannot weather difficult times without support from those he
loves.” He bowed again and said gently, “Only a suggestion, dear lady.”
Eragon watched as indignation and hurt crossed Helen’s face. Her eyes flashed as she shut the door
brusquely. Sighing, Jeod ran his fingers through his hair. Eragon thanked him for all his help, then mounted
Cadoc. With the last farewells said, he and Brom departed.
At Teirm’s south gate, the guards let them through without a second glance. As they rode under the giant
outer wall, Eragon saw movement in a shadow. Solembum was crouched on the ground, tail twitching.
The werecat followed them with inscrutable eyes. As the city receded into the distance, Eragon asked,
“What are werecats?”
Brom looked surprised at the question. “Why the sudden curiosity?”
“I heard someone mention them in Teirm. They’re not real, are they?” said Eragon, pretending
ignorance.
“They are quite real. During the Riders’ years of glory, they were as renowned as the dragons. Kings
and elves kept them as companions—yet the werecats were free to do what they chose. Very little has
ever been known about them. I’m afraid that their race has become rather scarce recently.”
“Could they use magic?” asked Eragon.
“No one’s sure, but they could certainly do unusual things. They always seemed to know what was
going on and somehow or another manage to get themselves involved.” Brom pulled his hood up to
block a chill wind.
“What’s Helgrind?” asked Eragon, after a moment’s thought.
“You’ll see when we get to Dras-Leona.”
When Teirm was out of sight, Eragon reached out with his mind and called,Saphira!The force of his
mental shout was so strong that Cadoc flicked his ears in annoyance.
Saphira answered and sped toward them with all of her strength. Eragon and Brom watched as a dark
blur rushed from a cloud, then heard a dull roar as Saphira’s wings flared open. The sun shone behind the
thin membranes, turning them translucent and silhouetting the dark veins. She landed with a blast of air.
Eragon tossed Cadoc’s reins to Brom. “I’ll join you for lunch.”
Brom nodded, but seemed preoccupied. “Have a good time,” he said, then looked at Saphira and
smiled. “It’s good to see you again.”
And you too.
Eragon hopped onto Saphira’s shoulders and held on tightly as she bounded upward. With the wind at
her tail, Saphira sliced through the air.Hold on, she warned Eragon, and letting out a wild bugle, she
soared in a great loop. Eragon yelled with excitement as he flung his arms in the air, holding on only with
his legs.
I didn’t know I could stay on while you did that without being strapped into the saddle,he said, grinning

Page 134

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

fiercely.
Neither did I,admitted Saphira, laughing in her peculiar way. Eragon hugged her tightly, and they flew a
level path, masters of the sky.
By noon his legs were sore from riding bareback, and his hands and face were numb from the cold air.
Saphira’s scales were always warm to the touch, but she could not keep him from getting chilled. When
they landed for lunch, he buried his hands in his clothes and found a warm, sunny place to sit. As he and
Brom ate, Eragon asked Saphira,Do you mind if I ride Cadoc?He had decided to question Brom further
about his past.
No, but tell me what he says.Eragon was not surprised that Saphira knew his plans. It was nearly
impossible to hide anything from her when they were mentally linked. When they finished eating, she flew
away as he joined Brom on the trail. After a time, Eragon slowed Cadoc and said, “I need to talk to you.
I wanted to do it when we first arrived in Teirm, but I decided to wait until now.”
“About what?” asked Brom.
Eragon paused. “There’s a lot going on that I don’t understand. For instance, who are your ‘friends,’
and why were you hiding in Carvahall? I trust you with my life—which is why I’m still traveling with
you—but I need to know more about who you are and what you are doing. What did you steal in
Gil’ead, and what is the tuatha du orothrim that you’re taking me through? I think that after all that’s
happened, I deserve an explanation.”
“You eavesdropped on us.”
“Only once,” said Eragon.
“I see that you have yet to learn proper manners,” said Brom grimly, tugging on his beard. “What makes
you think that this concerns you?”
“Nothing, really,” said Eragon shrugging. “Just it’s an odd coincidence that you happened to be hiding in
Carvahall when I found Saphira’s eggand that you also know so much dragonlore. The more I think
about it, the less likely it seems. There were other clues that I mostly ignored, but they’re obvious now
that I look back. Like how you knew of the Ra’zac in the first place and why they ran away when you
approached. And I can’t help but wonder if you had something to do with the appearance of Saphira’s
egg. There’s a lot you haven’t told us, and Saphira and I can’t afford to ignore anything that might be
dangerous.”
Dark lines appeared on Brom’s forehead as he reined Snowfire to a halt. “You won’t wait?” he asked.
Eragon shook his head mulishly. Brom sighed. “This wouldn’t be a problem if you weren’t so suspicious,
but I suppose that you wouldn’t be worth my time if you were otherwise.” Eragon was unsure if he
should take that as a compliment. Brom lit his pipe and slowly blew a plume of smoke into the air. “I’ll
tell you,” he said, “but you have to understand that I cannot reveal everything.” Eragon started to protest,
but Brom cut him off. “It’s not out of a desire to withhold information, but because I won’t give away
secrets that aren’t mine. There are other stories woven in with this narrative. You’ll have to talk with the
others involved to find out the rest.”
“Very well. Explain what you can,” said Eragon.
“Are you sure?” asked Brom. “There are reasons for my secretiveness. I’ve tried to protect you by

shielding you from forces that would tear you apart. Once you know of them and their purposes, you’ll
never have the chance to live quietly. You will have to choose sides and make a stand. Do you really
want to know?”
“I cannot live my life in ignorance,” said Eragon quietly.
“A worthy goal… Very well: there is a war raging in Alagaësia between the Varden and the Empire.
Their conflict, however, reaches far beyond any incidental armed clashes. They are locked in a titanic
power struggle… centered around you.”
“Me?” said Eragon, disbelieving. “That’s impossible. I don’t have anything to do with either of them.”
“Not yet,” said Brom, “but your very existence is the focus of their battles. The Varden and the Empire
aren’t fighting to control this land or its people. Their goal is to control the next generation of Riders, of
whom you are the first. Whoever controls these Riders will become the undisputed master of Alagaësia.”
Eragon tried to absorb Brom’s statements. It seemed incomprehensible that so many people would be
interested in him and Saphira. No one besides Brom had thought he was that important. The whole
concept of the Empire and Varden fighting over him was too abstract for him to grasp fully. Objections
quickly formed in his mind. “But all the Riders were killed except for the Forsworn, who joined
Galbatorix. As far as I know, even those are now dead. And you told me in Carvahall that no one knows
if there are still dragons in Alagaësia.”
“I lied about the dragons,” said Brom flatly. “Even though the Riders are gone, there are still three
dragon eggs left—all of them in Galbatorix’s possession. Actually there are only two now, since Saphira
hatched. The king salvaged the three during his last great battle with the Riders.”
“So there may soon be two new Riders, both of them loyal to the king?” asked Eragon with a sinking
feeling.
“Exactly,” said Brom. “There is a deadly race in progress. Galbatorix is desperately trying to find the
people for whom his eggs will hatch, while the Varden are employing every means to kill his candidates
or steal the eggs.”
“But where did Saphira’s egg come from? How could anyone have gotten it away from the king? And
why do you know all of this?” asked Eragon, bewildered.
“So many questions,” laughed Brom bitterly. “There is another chapter to all this, one that took place
long before you were born. Back then I was a bit younger, though perhaps not as wise. I hated the
Empire—for reasons I’ll keep to myself—and wanted to damage it in any way I could. My fervor led me
to a scholar, Jeod, who claimed to have discovered a book that showed a secret passageway into
Galbatorix’s castle. I eagerly brought Jeod to the Varden—who are my ‘friends’—and they arranged to
have the eggs stolen.”
The Varden!
“However, something went amiss, and our thief got only one egg. For some reason he fled with it and
didn’t return to the Varden. When he wasn’t found, Jeod and I were sent to bring him and the egg back.”
Brom’s eyes grew distant, and he spoke in a curious voice. “That was the start of one of the greatest
searches in history. We raced against the Ra’zac and Morzan, last of the Forsworn and the king’s finest
servant.”

Page 136

“Morzan!” interrupted Eragon. “But he was the one who betrayed the Riders to Galbatorix!”And that
happened so long ago! Morzan must have been ancient. It disturbed him to be reminded of how long
Riders lived.
“So?” asked Brom, raising an eyebrow. “Yes, he was old, but strong and cruel. He was one of the
king’s first followers and by far his most loyal. As there had been blood between us before, the hunt for
the egg turned into a personal battle. When it was located in Gil’ead, I rushed there and fought Morzan
for possession. It was a terrible contest, but in the end I slew him. During the conflict I was separated
from Jeod. There was no time to search for him, so I took the egg and bore it to the Varden, who asked
me to train whomever became the new Rider. I agreed and decided to hide in Carvahall—which I had
been to several times before—until the Varden contacted me. I was never summoned.”
“Then how did Saphira’s egg appear in the Spine? Was another one stolen from the king?” asked
Eragon.
Brom grunted. “Small chance of that. He has the remaining two guarded so thoroughly that it would be
suicide to try and steal them. No, Saphira was taken from the Varden, and I think I know how. To
protect the egg, its guardian must have tried to send it to me with magic.
“The Varden haven’t contacted me to explain how they lost the egg, so I suspect that their runners were
intercepted by the Empire and the Ra’zac were sent in their place. I’m sure they were quite eager to find
me, as I’ve managed to foil many of their plans.”
“Then the Ra’zac didn’t know about me when they arrived in Carvahall,” said Eragon with wonder.
“That’s right,” replied Brom. “If that ass Sloan had kept his mouth shut, they might not have found out
about you. Events could have turned out quite differently. In a way I have you to thank for my life. If the
Ra’zac hadn’t become so preoccupied with you, they might have caught me unawares, and that would
have been the end of Brom the storyteller. The only reason they ran was because I’m stronger than the
two of them, especially during the day. They must have planned to drug me during the night, then question
me about the egg.”
“You sent a message to the Varden, telling them about me?”
“Yes. I’m sure they’ll want me to bring you to them as soon as possible.”
“But you’re not going to, are you?”
Brom shook his head. “No, I’m not.”
“Why not? Being with the Varden must be safer than chasing after the Ra’zac, especially for a new
Rider.”
Brom snorted and looked at Eragon with fondness. “The Varden are dangerous people. If we go to
them, you will be entangled in their politics and machinations. Their leaders may send you on missions just
to make a point, even though you might not be strong enough for them. I want you to be well prepared
before you go anywhere near the Varden. At least while we pursue the Ra’zac, I don’t have to worry
about someone poisoning your water. This is the lesser of two evils. And,” he said with a smile, “it keeps
you happy while I train you… Tuatha du orothrim is just a stage in your instruction. Iwill help you
find—and perhaps even kill—the Ra’zac, for they are as much my enemies as yours. But then you will

Page 137

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

have to make a choice.”
“And that would be…?” asked Eragon warily.
“Whether to join the Varden,” said Brom. “If you kill the Ra’zac, the only ways for you to escape
Galbatorix’s wrath will be to seek the Varden’s protection, flee to Surda, or plead for the king’s mercy
and join his forces. Even if you don’t kill the Ra’zac, you will still face this choice eventually.”
Eragon knew the best way to gain sanctuary might be to join the Varden, but he did not want to spend
his entire life fighting the Empire like they did. He mulled over Brom’s comments, trying to consider them
from every angle. “You still didn’t explain how you know so much about dragons.”
“No, I didn’t, did I?” said Brom with a crooked smile. “That will have to wait for another time.”
Why me?Eragon asked himself. What made him so special that he should become a Rider? “Did you
ever meet my mother?” he blurted.
Brom looked grave. “Yes, I did.”
“What was she like?”
The old man sighed. “She was full of dignity and pride, like Garrow. Ultimately it was her downfall, but it
was one of her greatest gifts nevertheless… She always helped the poor and the less fortunate, no matter
what her situation.”
“You knew her well?” asked Eragon, startled.
“Well enough to miss her when she was gone.”
As Cadoc plodded along, Eragon tried to recall when he had thought that Brom was just a scruffy old
man who told stories. For the first time Eragon understood how ignorant he had been.
He told Saphira what he had learned. She was intrigued by Brom’s revelations, but recoiled from the
thought of being one of Galbatorix’s possessions. At last she said,Aren’t you glad that you didn’t stay in
Carvahall? Think of all the interesting experiences you would have missed!Eragon groaned in mock
distress.

When they stopped for the day, Eragon searched for water while Brom made dinner. He rubbed his
hands together for warmth as he walked in a large circle, listening for a creek or spring. It was gloomy
and damp between the trees.
He found a stream a ways from the camp, then crouched on the bank and watched the water splash
over the rocks, dipping in his fingertips. The icy mountain water swirled around his skin, numbing it.It
doesn’t care what happens to us, or anyone else, thought Eragon. He shivered and stood.
An unusual print on the opposing stream bank caught his attention. It was oddly shaped and very large.
Curious, he jumped across the stream and onto a rock shelf. As he landed, his foot hit a patch of damp
moss. He grabbed a branch for support, but it broke, and he thrust out his hand to break his fall. He felt
his right wrist crack as he hit the ground. Pain lanced up his arm.

Page 138

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

A steady stream of curses came out from behind his clenched teeth as he tried not to howl. Half blind
with pain, he curled on the ground, cradling his arm.Eragon! came Saphira’s alarmed cry.What
happened?
Broke my wrist… did something stupid… fell.
I’m coming,said Saphira.
No—I can make it back. Don’t… come. Trees too close for… wings.
She sent him a brief image of her tearing the forest apart to get at him, then said,Hurry.
Groaning, he staggered upright. The print was pressed deeply into the ground a few feet away. It was
the mark of a heavy, nail-studded boot. Eragon instantly remembered the tracks that had surrounded the
pile of bodies in Yazuac. “Urgal,” he spat, wishing that Zar’roc was with him; he could not use his bow
with only one hand. His head snapped up, and he shouted with his mind,Saphira! Urgals! Keep Brom
safe.
Eragon leapt back over the stream and raced toward their camp, yanking out his hunting knife. He saw
potential enemies behind every tree and bush.I hope there’s only one Urgal. He burst into the camp,
ducking as Saphira’s tail swung overhead. “Stop. It’s me!” he yelled.
Oops,said Saphira. Her wings were folded in front of her chest like a wall.
“Oops?” growled Eragon, running to her. “You could’ve killed me! Where’s Brom?”
“I’m right here,” snapped Brom’s voice from behind Saphira’s wings. “Tell your crazy dragon to release
me; she won’t listen to me.”
“Let him go!” said Eragon, exasperated. “Didn’t you tell him?”
No,she said sheepishly.You just said to keep him safe. She lifted her wings, and Brom stepped forward
angrily.
“I found an Urgal footprint. And it’s fresh.”
Brom immediately turned serious. “Saddle the horses. We’re leaving.” He put out the fire, but Eragon
did not move. “What’s wrong with your arm?”
“My wrist is broken,” he said, swaying.
Brom cursed and saddled Cadoc for him. He helped Eragon onto the horse and said, “We have to put a
splint on your arm as soon as possible. Try not to move your wrist until then.” Eragon gripped the reins
tightly with his left hand. Brom said to Saphira, “It’s almost dark; you might as well fly right overhead. If
Urgals show up, they’ll think twice about attacking with you nearby.”
They’d better, or else they won’t think again,remarked Saphira as she took off.
The light was disappearing quickly, and the horses were tired, but they spurred them on without respite.
Eragon’s wrist, swollen and red, continued to throb. A mile from the camp, Brom halted. “Listen,” he

Page 139

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

said.
Eragon heard the faint call of a hunting horn behind them. As it fell silent, panic gripped him. “They must
have found where we were,” said Brom, “and probably Saphira’s tracks. They will chase us now. It’s
not in their nature to let prey escape.” Then two horns winded. They were closer. A chill ran through
Eragon. “Our only chance is to run,” said Brom. He raised his head to the sky, and his face blanked as
he called Saphira.
She rushed out of the night sky and landed. “Leave Cadoc. Go with her. You’ll be safer,” commanded
Brom.
“What about you?” Eragon protested.
“I’ll be fine. Now go!” Unable to muster the energy to argue, Eragon climbed onto Saphira while Brom
lashed Snowfire and rode away with Cadoc. Saphira flew after him, flapping above the galloping horses.
Eragon clung to Saphira as best he could; he winced whenever her movements jostled his wrist. The
horns blared nearby, bringing a fresh wave of terror. Brom crashed through the underbrush, forcing the
horses to their limits. The horns trumpeted in unison close behind him, then were quiet.
Minutes passed.Where are the Urgals? wondered Eragon. A horn sounded, this time in the distance. He
sighed in relief, resting against Saphira’s neck, while on the ground Brom slowed his headlong rush.That
was close, said Eragon.
Yes, but we cannot stop until—Saphira was interrupted as a horn blasted directly underneath them.
Eragon jerked in surprise, and Brom resumed his frenzied retreat. Horned Urgals, shouting with coarse
voices, barreled along the trail on horses, swiftly gaining ground. They were almost in sight of Brom; the
old man could not outrun them.We have to do something! exclaimed Eragon.
What?
Land in front of the Urgals!
Are you crazy?demanded Saphira.
Land! I know what I’m doing,said Eragon.There isn’t time for anything else. They’re going to overtake
Brom!
Very well.Saphira pulled ahead of the Urgals, then turned, preparing to drop onto the trail. Eragon
reached for his power and felt the familiar resistance in his mind that separated him from the magic. He
did not try to breach it yet. A muscle twitched in his neck.
As the Urgals pounded up the trail, he shouted, “Now!” Saphira abruptly folded her wings and dropped
straight down from above the trees, landing on the trail in a spray of dirt and rocks.
The Urgals shouted with alarm and yanked on their horses’ reins. The animals went stiff-legged and
collided into each other, but the Urgals quickly untangled themselves to face Saphira with bared
weapons. Hate crossed their faces as they glared at her. There were twelve of them, all ugly, jeering
brutes. Eragon wondered why they did not flee. He had thought that the sight of Saphira would frighten
them away.Why are they waiting? Are they going to attack us or not?

Page 140

He was shocked when the largest Urgal advanced and spat, “Our master wishes to speak with you,
human!” The monster spoke in deep, rolling gutturals.
It’s a trap,warned Saphira before Eragon could say anything.Don’t listen to him.
At least let’s find out what he has to say,he reasoned, curious, but extremely wary. “Who is your
master?” he asked.
The Urgal sneered. “His name does not deserve to be given to one as low as yourself. He rules the sky
and holds dominance over the earth. You are no more than a stray ant to him. Yet he has decreed that
you shall be brought before him,alive.Take heart that you have become worthy of such notice!”
“I’ll never go with you nor any of my enemies!” declared Eragon, thinking of Yazuac. “Whether you
serve Shade, Urgal, or some twisted fiend I’ve not heard of, I have no wish to parley with him.”
“That is a grave mistake,” growled the Urgal, showing his fangs. “There is no way to escape him.
Eventually you will stand before our master. If you resist, he will fill your days with agony.”
Eragon wondered who had the power to bring the Urgals under one banner. Was there a third great
force loose in the land—along with the Empire and the Varden? “Keep your offer and tell your master
that the crows can eat his entrails for all I care!”
Rage swept through the Urgals; their leader howled, gnashing his teeth. “We’ll drag you to him, then!”
He waved his arm and the Urgals rushed at Saphira. Raising his right hand, Eragon barked, “Jierda!”
No!cried Saphira, but it was too late.
The monsters faltered as Eragon’s palm glowed. Beams of light lanced from his hand, striking each of
them in the gut. The Urgals were thrown through the air and smashed into trees, falling senseless to the
ground.
Fatigue suddenly drained Eragon of strength, and he tumbled off Saphira. His mind felt hazy and dull. As
Saphira bent over him, he realized that he might have gone too far. The energy needed to lift and throw
twelve Urgals was enormous. Fear engulfed him as he struggled to stay conscious.
At the edge of his vision he saw one of the Urgals stagger to his feet, sword in hand. Eragon tried to
warn Saphira, but he was too weak.No…, he thought feebly. The Urgal crept toward Saphira until he
was well past her tail, then raised his sword to strike her neck.No!… Saphira whirled on the monster,
roaring savagely. Her talons slashed with blinding speed. Blood spurted everywhere as the Urgal was
rent in two.
Saphira snapped her jaws together with finality and returned to Eragon. She gently wrapped her bloody
claws around his torso, then growled and jumped into the air. The night blurred into a pain-filled streak.
The hypnotic sound of Saphira’s wings put him in a bleary trance: up, down; up, down; up, down…
When Saphira eventually landed, Eragon was dimly aware of Brom talking with her. Eragon could not
understand what they said, but a decision must have been reached because Saphira took off again.
His stupor yielded to sleep that covered him like a soft blanket.
VISION OFPERFECTION

Page 141

Eragon twisted under the blankets, reluctant to open his eyes. He dozed, then a fuzzy thought entered his
mind…How did I get here? Confused, he pulled the blankets tighter and felt something hard on his right
arm. He tried to move his wrist. It zinged with pain.The Urgals! He bolted upright.
He lay in a small clearing that was empty save a small campfire heating a stew-filled pot. A squirrel
chattered on a branch. His bow and quiver rested alongside the blankets. Attempting to stand made him
grimace, as his muscles were feeble and sore. There was a heavy splint on his bruised right arm.
Where is everyone?he wondered forlornly. He tried to call Saphira, but to his alarm could not feel her.
Ravenous hunger gripped him, so he ate the stew. Still hungry, he looked for the saddlebags, hoping to
find a chunk of bread. Neither the saddlebags nor the horses were in the clearing.I’m sure there’s a good
reason for this, he thought, suppressing a surge of uneasiness.
He wandered about the clearing, then returned to his blankets and rolled them up. Without anything
better to do, he sat against a tree and watched the clouds overhead. Hours passed, but Brom and
Saphira did not show up.I hope nothing’s wrong.
As the afternoon dragged on, Eragon grew bored and started to explore the surrounding forest. When
he became tired, he rested under a fir tree that leaned against a boulder with a bowl-shaped depression
filled with clear dew water.
Eragon stared at the water and thought about Brom’s instructions for scrying.Maybe I can see where
Saphira is. Brom said that scrying takes a lot of energy, but I’m stronger than he is… He breathed deeply
and closed his eyes. In his mind he formed a picture of Saphira, making it as lifelike as possible. It was
more demanding than he expected. Then he said, “Draumr kópa!” and gazed at the water.
Its surface became completely flat, frozen by an invisible force. The reflections disappeared and the
water became clear. On it shimmered an image of Saphira. Her surroundings were pure white, but
Eragon could see that she was flying. Brom sat on her back, beard streaming, sword on his knees.
Eragon tiredly let the image fade.At least they’re safe. He gave himself a few minutes to recuperate, then
leaned back over the water.Roran, how are you? In his mind he saw his cousin clearly. Impulsively, he
drew upon the magic and uttered the words.
The water grew still, then the image formed on its surface. Roran appeared, sitting on an invisible chair.
Like Saphira, his surroundings were white. There were new lines on Roran’s face—he looked more like
Garrow than ever before. Eragon held the image in place as long as he could.Is Roran in Therinsford?
He’s certainly nowhere I’ve been.
The strain of using magic had brought beads of sweat to his forehead. He sighed and for a long time was
content just to sit. Then an absurd notion struck him.What if I tried to scry something I created with my
imagination or saw in a dream? He smiled.Perhaps I’d be shown what my own consciousness looks like.
It was too tempting an idea to pass by. He knelt by the water once again.What shall I look for? He
considered a few things, but discarded them all when he remembered his dream about the woman in the
cell.
After fixing the scene in his mind, he spoke the words and watched the water intently. He waited, but
nothing happened. Disappointed, he was about to release the magic when inky blackness swirled across
the water, covering the surface. The image of a lone candle flickered in the darkness, brightening to

Page 142

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

illuminate a stone cell. The woman from his dream was curled up on a cot in one corner. She lifted her
head, dark hair falling back, and stared directly at Eragon. He froze, the force of her gaze keeping him in
place. Chills ran up his spine as their eyes locked. Then the woman trembled and collapsed limply.
The water cleared. Eragon rocked back on his heels, gasping. “This can’t be.”She shouldn’t be real; I
only dreamed about her! How could she know I was looking at her? And how could I have scryed into a
dungeon that I’ve never seen? He shook his head, wondering if any of his other dreams had been visions.
The rhythmic thump of Saphira’s wings interrupted his thoughts. He hurried back to the clearing, arriving
just as Saphira landed. Brom was on her back, as Eragon had seen, but his sword was now bloody.
Brom’s face was contorted; the edges of his beard were stained red. “What happened?” asked Eragon,
afraid that he had been wounded.
“What happened?” roared the old man. “I’ve been trying to clean up your mess!” He slashed the air with
the sword, flinging drops of blood along its arc. “Do you know what you did with that little trick of
yours? Do you?”
“I stopped the Urgals from catching you,” said Eragon, a pit forming in his stomach.
“Yes,” growled Brom, “but that piece of magic nearly killed you! You’ve been sleeping for two days.
There were twelve Urgals.Twelve! But that didn’t stop you from trying to throw them all the way to
Teirm, now did it? What were you thinking? Sending a rock through each of their heads would have been
the smart thing to do. But no, you had to knock them unconscious so they could run away later. I’ve
spent the last two days trying to track them down. Even with Saphira, three escaped!”
“I didn’t want to kill them,” said Eragon, feeling very small.
“It wasn’t a problem in Yazuac.”
“There was no choice then, and I couldn’t control the magic. This time it just seemed… extreme.”
“Extreme!” cried Brom. “It’s not extreme when they wouldn’t show you the same mercy. And why, oh
why, did youshow yourself to them?”
“You said that they had found Saphira’s footprints. It didn’t make any difference if they saw me,” said
Eragon defensively.
Brom stabbed his sword into the dirt and snapped, “I said they hadprobably found her tracks. We
didn’t know for certain. They might have believed they were chasing some stray travelers. But why
would they think that now? After all,you landed right in front of them!And since you let them live, they’re
scrambling around the countryside with all sorts of fantastic tales! This might even get back to the
Empire!” He threw his hands up. “You don’t even deserve to be called a Rider after this,boy.” Brom
yanked his sword out of the ground and stomped to the fire. He took a rag from inside his robe and
angrily began to clean the blade.
Eragon was stunned. He tried to ask Saphira for advice, but all she would say was,Speak with Brom.
Hesitantly, Eragon made his way to the fire and asked, “Would it help if I said I was sorry?”
Brom sighed and sheathed his sword. “No, it wouldn’t. Your feelings can’t change what happened.” He
jabbed his finger at Eragon’s chest. “You made some very bad choices that could have dangerous

repercussions. Not the least of which is that you almost died. Died, Eragon! From now on you’re going
to have to think. There’s a reason why we’re born with brains in our heads, not rocks.”
Eragon nodded, abashed. “It’s not as bad as you think, though; the Urgals already knew about me.
They had orders to capture me.”
Astonishment widened Brom’s eyes. He stuck his unlit pipe in his mouth. “No, it’s not as bad as I
thought. It’s worse! Saphira told me you had talked with the Urgals, but she didn’t mention this.” The
words tumbled out of Eragon’s mouth as he quickly described the confrontation. “So they have some
sort of leader now, eh?” questioned Brom.
Eragon nodded.
“And you just defied his wishes, insulted him, and attacked his men?” Brom shook his head. “I didn’t
think it could get any worse. If the Urgals had been killed, your rudeness would have gone unnoticed, but
now it’ll be impossible to ignore. Congratulations, you just made enemies with one of the most powerful
beings in Alagaësia.”
“All right, I made a mistake,” said Eragon sullenly.
“Yes, you did,” agreed Brom, eyes flashing. “What has me worried, though, is who this Urgal leader is.”
Shivering, Eragon asked softly, “What happens now?”
There was an uncomfortable pause. “Your arm is going to take at least a couple of weeks to heal. That
time would be well spent forging some sense into you. I suppose this is partially my fault. I’ve been
teaching youhow to do things, but not whether youshould. It takes discretion, something you obviously
lack. All the magic in Alagaësia won’t help you if you don’t know when to use it.”
“But we’re still going to Dras-Leona, right?” asked Eragon.
Brom rolled his eyes. “Yes, we can keep looking for the Ra’zac, but even if we find them, it won’t do
any good until you’ve healed.” He began unsaddling Saphira. “Are you well enough to ride?”
“I think so.”
“Good, then we can still cover a few miles today.”
“Where are Cadoc and Snowfire?”
Brom pointed off to the side. “Over there a ways. I picketed them where there was grass.” Eragon
prepared to leave, then followed Brom to the horses.
Saphira said pointedly,If you had explained what you were planning to do, none of this would have
happened. I would have told you it was a bad idea not to kill the Urgals. I only agreed to do what you
asked because I assumed it was halfway reasonable!
I don’t want to talk about it.
As you wish,she sniffed.

As they rode, every bump and dip in the trail made Eragon grit his teeth with discomfort. If he had been
alone, he would have stopped. With Brom there, he dared not complain. Also, Brom started drilling him
with difficult scenarios involving Urgals, magic, and Saphira. The imagined fights were many and varied.
Sometimes a Shade or other dragons were included. Eragon discovered that it was possible to torture his
body and mind at the same time. He got most of the questions wrong and became increasingly frustrated.
When they stopped for the night, Brom grumbled shortly, “It was a start.” Eragon knew that he was
disappointed.
MASTER OF THEBLADE
The next day was easier on both of them. Eragon felt better and was able to answer more of Brom’s
questions correctly. After an especially difficult exercise, Eragon mentioned his scrying of the woman.
Brom pulled on his beard. “You say she was imprisoned?”
“Yes.”
“Did you see her face?” asked Brom intently.
“Not very clearly. The lighting was bad, yet I could tell that she was beautiful. It’s strange; I didn’t have
any problem seeing her eyes. And she did look at me.”
Brom shook his head. “As far as I know, it’s impossible for anyone to know if they’re being scryed
upon.”
“Do you know who she might be?” asked Eragon, surprised by the eagerness in his own voice.
“Not really,” admitted Brom. “If pressed, I suppose I could come up with a few guesses, but none of
them would be very likely. This dream of yours is peculiar. Somehow you managed to scry in your sleep
something that you’d never seen before—without saying the words of power. Dreams do occasionally
touch the spirit realm, but this is different.”
“Perhaps to understand this we should search every prison and dungeon until we find the woman,”
bantered Eragon. He actually thought it would be a good idea. Brom laughed and rode on.

Brom’s strict training filled nearly every hour as the days slowly blended into weeks. Because of his
splint, Eragon was forced to use his left hand whenever they sparred. Before long he could duel as well
with his left hand as he had with his right.
By the time they crossed the Spine and came to the plains, spring had crept over Alagaësia, summoning
a multitude of flowers. The bare deciduous trees were russet with buds, while new blades of grass began
to push up between last year’s dead stalks. Birds returned from their winter absence to mate and build
nests.
The travelers followed the Toark River southeast, along the edge of the Spine. It grew steadily as
tributaries flowed into it from every side, feeding its bulging girth. When the river was over a league wide,
Brom pointed at the silt islands that dotted the water. “We’re close to Leona Lake now,” he said. “It’s
only about two leagues away.”

“Do you think we can get there before nightfall?” asked Eragon.
“We can try.”
Dusk soon made the trail hard to follow, but the sound of the river at their side guided them. When the
moon rose, the bright disk provided enough light to see what lay ahead.
Leona Lake looked like a thin sheet of silver beaten over the land. The water was so calm and smooth it
did not even seem to be liquid. Aside from a bright strip of moonlight reflecting off the surface, it was
indistinguishable from the ground. Saphira was on the rocky shore, fanning her wings to dry them. Eragon
greeted her and she said,The water is lovely—deep, cool, and clear.
Maybe I’ll go swimming tomorrow,he responded. They set up camp under a stand of trees and were
soon asleep.

At dawn, Eragon eagerly rushed out to see the lake in daylight. A whitecapped expanse of water rippled
with fan-shaped patterns where wind brushed it. The pure size of it delighted him. He whooped and ran
to the water.Saphira, where are you? Let’s have some fun!
The moment Eragon climbed onto her, she jumped out over the water. They soared upward, circling
over the lake, but even at that height the opposing shore was not visible.Would you like to take a bath?
Eragon casually asked Saphira.
She grinned wolfishly.Hold on! She locked her wings and sank to the waves, clipping the crests with her
claws. The water sparkled in the sunlight as they sailed over it. Eragon whooped again. Then Saphira
folded her wings and dived into the lake, her head and neck entering it like a lance.
The water hit Eragon like an icy wall, knocking out his breath and almost tearing him off Saphira. He
held on tightly as she swam to the surface. With three strokes of her feet, she breached it and sent a burst
of shimmering water toward the sky. Eragon gasped and shook his hair as Saphira slithered across the
lake, using her tail as a rudder.
Ready?
Eragon nodded and took a deep breath, tightening his arms. This time they slid gently under the water.
They could see for yards through the unclouded liquid. Saphira twisted and turned in fantastic shapes,
slipping through the water like an eel. Eragon felt as if he were riding a sea serpent of legend.
Just as his lungs started to cry for air, Saphira arched her back and pointed her head upward. An
explosion of droplets haloed them as she leapt into the air, wings snapping open. With two powerful flaps
she gained altitude.
Wow! That was fantastic,exclaimed Eragon.
Yes,said Saphira happily.Though it’s a pity you can’t hold your breath longer.
Nothing I can do about that,he said, pressing water out of his hair. His clothes were drenched, and the
wind from Saphira’s wings chilled him. He pulled at his splint—his wrist itched.

Once Eragon was dry, he and Brom saddled the horses and started around Leona Lake in high spirits
while Saphira playfully dived in and out of the water.

Before dinner, Eragon blocked Zar’roc’s edge in preparation for their usual sparring. Neither he nor
Brom moved as they waited for the other to strike first. Eragon inspected their surroundings for anything
that might give him an advantage. A stick near the fire caught his attention.
Eragon swooped down, grabbed the stick, and hurled it at Brom. The splint got in his way, though, and
Brom easily sidestepped the piece of wood. The old man rushed forward, swinging his sword. Eragon
ducked just as the blade whistled over his head. He growled and tackled Brom ferociously.
They pitched to the ground, each struggling to stay on top. Eragon rolled to the side and swept Zar’roc
over the ground at Brom’s shins. Brom parried the blow with the hilt of his sword, then jumped to his
feet. Twisting as he stood, Eragon attacked again, guiding Zar’roc through a complex pattern. Sparks
danced from their blades as they struck again and again. Brom blocked each blow, his face tight with
concentration. But Eragon could tell that he was tiring. The relentless hammering continued as each
sought an opening in the other’s defenses.
Then Eragon felt the battle change. Blow by blow he gained advantage; Brom’s parries slowed and he
lost ground. Eragon easily blocked a stab from Brom. Veins pulsed on the old man’s forehead and cords
bulged in his neck from the effort.
Suddenly confident, Eragon swung Zar’roc faster than ever, weaving a web of steel around Brom’s
sword. With a burst of speed, he smashed the flat of his blade against Brom’s guard and knocked the
sword to the ground. Before Brom could react, Eragon flicked Zar’roc up to his throat.
They stood panting, the red sword tip resting on Brom’s collarbone. Eragon slowly lowered his arm and
backed away. It was the first time he had bested Brom without resorting to trickery. Brom picked up his
sword and sheathed it. Still breathing hard, he said, “We’re done for today.”
“But we just started,” said Eragon, startled.
Brom shook his head. “I can teach you nothing more of the sword. Of all the fighters I’ve met, only three
of them could have defeated me like that, and I doubt any of them could have done it with their left
hand.” He smiled ruefully. “I may not be as young as I used to be, but I can tell that you’re a talented and
rare swordsman.”
“Does this mean we’re not going to spar every night?” asked Eragon.
“Oh, you’re not getting out of it,” laughed Brom. “But we’ll go easier now. It’s not as important if we
miss a night here or there.” He wiped his brow. “Just remember, if you ever have the misfortune to fight
an elf—trained or not, female or male—expect to lose. They, along with dragons and other creatures of
magic, are many times stronger than nature intended. Even the weakest elf could easily overpower you.
The same goes for the Ra’zac—they are not human and tire much more slowly than we do.”
“Is there any way to become their equal?” asked Eragon. He sat cross-legged by Saphira.
You fought well,she said. He smiled.

Page 147

Brom seated himself with a shrug. “There are a few, but none are available to you now. Magic will let
you defeat all but the strongest enemies. For those you’ll need Saphira’s help, plus a great deal of luck.
Remember, when creatures of magic actually use magic, they can accomplish things that could kill a
human, because of their enhanced abilities.”
“How do you fight with magic?” asked Eragon.
“What do you mean?”
“Well,” he said, leaning on an elbow. “Suppose I was attacked by a Shade. How could I block his
magic? Most spells take place instantaneously, which makes it impossible to react in time. And even if I
could, how would I nullify an enemy’s magic? It seems I would have to know my opponent’s intention
before he acted.” He paused. “I just don’t see how it can be done. Whoever attacked first would win.”
Brom sighed. “What you are talking about—a ‘wizards’ duel,’ if you will—is extremely dangerous.
Haven’t you ever wondered how Galbatorix was able to defeat all of the Riders with the help of only a
dozen or so traitors?”
“I never thought about it,” acknowledged Eragon.
“There are several ways. Some you’ll learn about later, but the main one is that Galbatorix was, and still
is, a master of breaking into people’s minds. You see, in a wizards’ duel there are strict rules that each
side must observe or else both contestants will die. To begin with, no one uses magic until one of the
participants gains access to the other’s mind.”
Saphira curled her tail comfortably around Eragon and asked,Why wait? By the time an enemy realizes
that you’ve attacked, it will be too late for him to act.Eragon repeated the question out loud.
Brom shook his head. “No, it won’t. If I were to suddenly use my power against you, Eragon, you
would surely die, but in the brief moment before you were destroyed, there would be time for a
counterattack. Therefore, unless one combatant has a death wish, neither side attacks until one of them
has breached the other’s defenses.”
“Then what happens?” Eragon inquired.
Brom shrugged and said, “Once you’re inside your enemy’s mind, it’s easy enough to anticipate what he
will do and prevent it. Even with that advantage, it’s still possible to lose if you don’t know how to
counteract spells.”
He filled and lit his pipe. “And that requires extraordinarily quick thinking. Before you can defend
yourself, you have to understand the exact nature of the forces directed at you. If you’re being attacked
with heat, you have to know whether it is being conveyed to you through air, fire, light, or some other
medium. Only once that’s known can you combat the magic by, for instance, chilling the heated material.”
“It sounds difficult.”
“Extremely,” confirmed Brom. A plume of smoke rose from his pipe. “Seldom can people survive such a
duel for more than a few seconds. The enormous amount of effort and skill required condemns anyone
without the proper training to a quick death. Once you’ve progressed, I’ll start teaching you the
necessary methods. In the meantime, if you ever find yourself facing a wizards’ duel, I suggest you run
away as fast as you can.”

THEMIRE OFDRAS-LEONA
They lunched at Fasaloft, a bustling lakeside village. It was a charming place set on a rise overlooking
the lake. As they ate in the hostel’s common room, Eragon listened intently to the gossip and was
relieved to hear no rumors of him and Saphira.
The trail, now a road, had grown steadily worse over the past two days. Wagon wheels and iron-shod
hooves had conspired to tear up the ground, making many sections impassable. An increase in travelers
forced Saphira to hide during the day and then catch up with Brom and Eragon at night.
For days they continued south along Leona Lake’s vast shore. Eragon began to wonder if they would
ever get around it, so he was heartened when they met men who said that Dras-Leona was an easy day’s
ride ahead of them.

Eragon rose early the following morning. His fingers twitched with anticipation at the thought of finally
finding the Ra’zac.The two of you must be careful, said Saphira.The Ra’zac could have spies watching
for travelers that fit your description.
We’ll do our best to remain inconspicuous,he assured her.
She lowered her head until their eyes met.Perhaps, but realize that I won’t be able to protect you as I
did with the Urgals. I will be too far away to come to your aid, nor would I survive long in the narrow
streets your kind favor. Follow Brom’s lead in this hunt; he is sensible.
I know,he said somberly.
Will you go with Brom to the Varden? Once the Ra’zac are killed, he will want to take you to them.
And since Galbatorix will be enraged by the Ra’zac’s death, that may be the safest thing for us to do.
Eragon rubbed his arms.I don’t want to fight the Empire all the time like the Varden do. Life is more than
constant war. There’ll be time to consider it once the Ra’zac are gone.
Don’t be too sure,she warned, then went to hide herself until night.
The road was clogged with farmers taking their goods to market in Dras-Leona. Brom and Eragon were
forced to slow their horses and wait for wagons that blocked the way.
Although they saw smoke in the distance before noon, it was another league before the city was clearly
visible. Unlike Teirm, a planned city, Dras-Leona was a tangled mess that sprawled next to Leona Lake.
Ramshackle buildings sat on crooked streets, and the heart of the city was surrounded by a dirty, pale
yellow wall of daubed mud.
Several miles east, a mountain of bare rock speared the sky with spires and columns, a tenebrous
nightmare ship. Near-vertical sides rose out of the ground like a jagged piece of the earth’s bone.
Brom pointed. “Thatis Helgrind. It’s the reason Dras-Leona was originally built. People are fascinated
by it, even though it’s an unhealthy and malevolent thing.” He gestured at the buildings inside the city’s
wall. “We should go to the center of the city first.”

Page 149

As they crept along the road to Dras-Leona, Eragon saw that the highest building within the city was a
cathedral that loomed behind the walls. It was strikingly similar to Helgrind, especially when its arches
and flanged spires caught the light. “Who do they worship?” he asked.
Brom grimaced in distaste. “Their prayers go to Helgrind. It’s a cruel religion they practice. They drink
human blood and make flesh offerings. Their priests often lack body parts because they believe that the
more bone and sinew you give up, the less you’re attached to the mortal world. They spend much of their
time arguing about which of Helgrind’s three peaks is the highest and most important and whether the
fourth—and lowest—should be included in their worship.”
“That’s horrible,” said Eragon, shuddering.
“Yes,” said Brom grimly, “but don’t say that to a believer. You’ll quickly lose a hand in ‘penance.’ ”
At Dras-Leona’s enormous gates, they led the horses through the crush of people. Ten soldiers were
stationed on either side of the gates, casually scanning the crowd. Eragon and Brom passed into the city
without incident.
The houses inside the city wall were tall and thin to compensate for the lack of space. Those next to the
wall were braced against it. Most of the houses hung over the narrow, winding streets, covering the sky
so that it was hard to tell if it was night or day. Nearly all the buildings were constructed of the same
rough brown wood, which darkened the city even more. The air reeked like a sewer; the streets were
filthy.
A group of ragged children ran between the houses, fighting over scraps of bread. Deformed beggars
crouched next to the entrance gates, pleading for money. Their cries for help were like a chorus of the
damned.We don’t even treat animals like this, thought Eragon, eyes wide with anger. “I won’t stay here,”
he said, rebelling against the sight.
“It gets better farther in,” said Brom. “Right now we need to find an inn and form a strategy. Dras-Leona
can be a dangerous place to even the most cautious. I don’t want to remain on the streets any longer than
necessary.”
They forged deeper into Dras-Leona, leaving the squalid entrance behind. As they entered wealthier
parts of the city, Eragon wondered,How can these people live in ease when the suffering around them is
so obvious?
They found lodging at the Golden Globe, which was cheap but not decrepit. A narrow bed was
crammed against one wall of the room, with a rickety table and a basin alongside it. Eragon took one
look at the mattress and said, “I’m sleeping on the floor. There are probably enough bugs in that thing to
eat me alive.”
“Well, I wouldn’t want to deprive them of a meal,” said Brom, dropping his bags on the mattress.
Eragon set his own on the floor and pulled off his bow.
“What now?” he asked.
“We find food and beer. After that, sleep. Tomorrow we can start looking for the Ra’zac.” Before they
left the room, Brom warned, “No matter what happens, make sure that your tongue doesn’t loosen.
We’ll have to leave immediately if we’re given away.”

Page 150

The inn’s food was barely adequate, but its beer was excellent. By the time they stumbled back to the
room, Eragon’s head was buzzing pleasantly. He unrolled his blankets on the floor and slid under them as
Brom tumbled onto the bed.
Just before Eragon fell asleep, he contacted Saphira:We’re going to be here for a few days, but this
shouldn’t take as long as it did at Teirm. When we discover where the Ra’zac are, you might be able to
help us get them. I’ll talk to you in the morning. Right now I’m not thinking too clearly.
You’ve been drinking,came the accusing thought. Eragon considered it for a moment and had to agree
that she was absolutely right. Her disapproval was clear, but all she said was,I won’t envy you in the
morning.
No,groaned Eragon,but Brom will. He drank twice as much as I did.
TRAIL OFOIL
What was I thinking?wondered Eragon in the morning. His head was pounding and his tongue felt thick
and fuzzy. As a rat skittered under the floor, Eragon winced at the noise.
How are we feeling?asked Saphira smugly.
Eragon ignored her.
A moment later, Brom rolled out of bed with a grumble. He doused his head in cold water from the
basin, then left the room. Eragon followed him into the hallway. “Where are you going?” he asked.
“To recover.”
“I’ll come.” At the bar, Eragon discovered that Brom’s method of recovery involved imbibing copious
amounts of hot tea and ice water and washing it all down with brandy. When they returned to the room,
Eragon was able to function somewhat better.
Brom belted on his sword and smoothed the wrinkles out of his robe. “The first thing we need to do is
ask some discreet questions. I want to find out where the Seithr oil was delivered in Dras-Leona and
where it was taken from there. Most likely, soldiers or workmen were involved in transporting it. We
have to find those men and get one to talk.”
They left the Golden Globe and searched for warehouses where the Seithr oil might have been delivered.
Near the center of Dras-Leona, the streets began to slant upward toward a palace of polished granite. It
was built on a rise so that it towered above every building except the cathedral.
The courtyard was a mosaic of mother-of-pearl, and parts of the walls were inlaid with gold. Black
statues stood in alcoves, with sticks of incense smoking in their cold hands. Soldiers stationed every four
yards watched passersby keenly.
“Who lives there?” asked Eragon in awe.
“Marcus Tábor, ruler of this city. He answers only to the king and his own conscience, which hasn’t
been very active recently,” said Brom. They walked around the palace, looking at the gated, ornate
houses that surrounded it.

Page 151

By midday they had learned nothing useful, so they stopped for lunch. “This city is too vast for us to
comb it together,” said Brom. “Search on your own. Meet me at the Golden Globe by dusk.” He
glowered at Eragon from under his bushy eyebrows. “I’m trusting you not to do anything stupid.”
“I won’t,” promised Eragon. Brom handed him some coins, then strode away in the opposite direction.
Throughout the rest of the day, Eragon talked with shopkeepers and workers, trying to be as pleasant
and charming as he could. His questions led him from one end of the city to the other and back again. No
one seemed to know about the oil. Wherever he went, the cathedral stared down at him. It was
impossible to escape its tall spires.
At last he found a man who had helped ship the Seithr oil and remembered to which warehouse it had
been taken. Eragon excitedly went to look at the building, then returned to the Golden Globe. It was over
an hour before Brom came back, slumped with fatigue. “Did you find anything?” asked Eragon.
Brom brushed back his white hair. “I heard a great deal of interesting things today, not the least of which
is that Galbatorix will visit Dras-Leona within the week.”
“What?” exclaimed Eragon.
Brom slouched against the wall, the lines on his forehead deepening. “It seems that Tábor has taken a
few too many liberties with his power, so Galbatorix has decided to come teach him a lesson in humility.
It’s the first time the king has left Urû’baen in over ten years.”
“Do you think he knows of us?” asked Eragon.
“Of course heknows of us, but I’m sure he hasn’t been told our location. If he had, we would already be
in the Ra’zac’s grasp. However, this means that whatever we’re going to do about the Ra’zac must be
accomplished before Galbatorix arrives. We don’t want to be anywhere within twenty leagues of him.
The one thing in our favor is that the Ra’zac are sure to be here, preparing for his visit.”
“I want to get the Ra’zac,” said Eragon, his fists tightening, “but not if it means fighting the king. He could
probably tear me to pieces.”
That seemed to amuse Brom. “Very good: caution. And you’re right; you wouldn’t stand a chance
against Galbatorix. Now tell me what you learned today. It might confirm what I heard.”
Eragon shrugged. “It was mostly drivel, but I did talk with a man who knew where the oil was taken. It’s
just an old warehouse. Other than that, I didn’t discover anything useful.”
“My day was a little more fruitful than yours. I heard the same thing you did, so I went to the warehouse
and talked with the workers. It didn’t take much cajoling before they revealed that the cases of Seithr oil
are always sent from the warehouse to the palace.”
“And that’s when you came back here,” finished Eragon.
“No, it’s not! Don’t interrupt. After that, I went to the palace and got myself invited into the servants’
quarters as a bard. For several hours I wandered about, amusing the maids and others with songs and
poems—and asking questions all the while.” Brom slowly filled his pipe with tobacco. “It’s really amazing
all the things servants find out. Did you know that one of the earls hasthree mistresses, and they all live in

Page 152

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

the same wing of the palace?” He shook his head and lit the pipe. “Aside from the fascinating tidbits, I
was told, quite by accident, where the oil is taken from the palace.”
“And that is…?” asked Eragon impatiently.
Brom puffed on his pipe and blew a smoke ring. “Out of the city, of course. Every full moon two slaves
are sent to the base of Helgrind with a month’s worth of provisions. Whenever the Seithr oil arrives in
Dras-Leona, they send it along with the provisions. The slaves are never seen again. And the one time
someone followed them, he disappeared too.”
“I thought the Riders demolished the slave trade,” said Eragon.
“Unfortunately, it has flourished under the king’s reign.”
“So the Ra’zac are in Helgrind,” said Eragon, thinking of the rock mountain.
“There or somewhere nearby.”
“If theyare in Helgrind, they’ll be either at the bottom—and protected by a thick stone door—or higher
up where only their flying mounts, or Saphira, can reach. Top or bottom, their shelter will no doubt be
disguised.” He thought for a moment. “If Saphira and I go flying around Helgrind, the Ra’zac are sure to
see us—not to mention all of Dras-Leona.”
“It is a problem,” agreed Brom.
Eragon frowned. “What if we took the place of the two slaves? The full moon isn’t far off. It would give
us a perfect opportunity to get close to the Ra’zac.”
Brom tugged his beard thoughtfully. “That’s chancy at best. If the slaves are killed from a distance, we’ll
be in trouble. We can’t harm the Ra’zac if they aren’t in sight.”
“We don’t know if the slaves are killed at all,” Eragon pointed out.
“I’m sure they are,” said Brom, his face grave. Then his eyes sparkled, and he blew another smoke ring.
“Still, it’s an intriguing idea. If it were done with Saphira hidden nearby and a…” His voice trailed off. “It
might work, but we’ll have to move quickly. With the king coming, there isn’t much time.”
“Should we go to Helgrind and look around? It would be good to see the land in daylight so we won’t
be surprised by any ambushes,” said Eragon.
Brom fingered his staff. “That can be done later. Tomorrow I’ll return to the palace and figure out how
we can replace the slaves. I have to be careful not to arouse suspicion, though—I could easily be
revealed by spies and courtiers who know about the Ra’zac.”
“I can’t believe it; we actually found them,” said Eragon quietly. An image of his dead uncle and burned
farm flashed through his mind. His jaw tightened.
“The toughest part is yet to come, but yes, we’ve done well,” said Brom. “If fortune smiles on us, you
may soon have your revenge and the Varden will be rid of a dangerous enemy. What comes after that
will be up to you.”

Eragon opened his mind and jubilantly told Saphira,We found the Ra’zac’s lair!
Where?He quickly explained what they had discovered.Helgrind, she mused.A fitting place for them.
Eragon agreed.When we’re done here, maybe we could visit Carvahall.
What is it you want?she asked, suddenly sour.To go back to your previous life? You know that won’t
happen, so stop mooning after it! At a certain point you have to decide what to commit to. Will you hide
for the rest of your life, or will you help the Varden? Those are the only options left to you, unless you
join forces with Galbatorix, which I do not and never will accept.
Softly, he said, If I must choose, I cast my fate with the Varden, as you well know.
Yes, but sometimes you have to hear yourself say it.She left him to ponder her words.
WORSHIPERS OFHELGRIND
Eragon was alone in the room when he woke. Scrawled onto the wall with a charcoal stick was a note
that read:

Eragon,

I will be gone until late tonight. Coins for food are under the mattress. Explore the city, enjoy yourself,
butstay unnoticed!

Brom

P.S. Avoid the palace. Don’t go anywhere without your bow! Keep it strung.

Eragon wiped the wall clean, then retrieved the money from under the bed. He slipped the bow across
his back, thinking,I wish I didn’t have to go armed all the time.
He left the Golden Globe and ambled through the streets, stopping to observe whatever interested him.
There were many intriguing stores, but none quite as exciting as Angela’s herb shop in Teirm. At times he
glared at the dark, claustrophobic houses and wished that he were free of the city. When he grew hungry,
he bought a wedge of cheese and a loaf of bread and ate them, sitting on a curb.
Later, in a far corner of Dras-Leona, he heard an auctioneer rattling off a list of prices. Curious, he
headed toward the voice and arrived at a wide opening between two buildings. Ten men stood on a
waist-high platform. Arrayed before them was a richly dressed crowd that was both colorful and
boisterous.Where are the goods for sale? wondered Eragon.

Page 154

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

The auctioneer finished his list and motioned for a young man behind the platform to join him. The man
awkwardly climbed up, chains dragging at his hands and feet. “And here we have our first item,”
proclaimed the auctioneer. “A healthy male from the Hadarac Desert, captured just last month, and in
excellent condition. Look at those arms and legs; he’s strong as a bull! He’d be perfect as a shield
bearer, or, if you don’t trust him for that, hard labor. But let me tell you, lords and ladies, that would be a
waste. He’s bright as a nail, if you can get him to talk a civilized tongue!”
The crowd laughed, and Eragon ground his teeth with fury. His lips started to form a word that would
free the slave, and his arm, newly liberated from the splint, rose. The mark on his palm shimmered. He
was about to release the magic when it struck him,He’d never get away!The slave would be caught
before he reached the city walls. Eragon would only make the situation worse if he tried to help. He
lowered his arm and quietly cursed.Think! This is how you got into trouble with the Urgals.
He watched helplessly as the slave was sold to a tall, hawk-nosed man. The next slave was a tiny girl, no
more than six years old, wrenched from the arms of her crying mother. As the auctioneer started the
bidding, Eragon forced himself to walk away, rigid with fury and outrage.
It was several blocks before the weeping was inaudible.I’d like to see a thief try to cut my purse right
now, he thought grimly, almost wishing it would happen. Frustrated, he punched a nearby wall, bruising
his knuckles.
That’s the sort of thing I could stop by fighting the Empire,he realized. With Saphira by my side I could
free those slaves. I’ve been graced with special powers; it would be selfish of me not to use them for the
benefit of others. If I don’t, I might as well not be a Rider at all.
It was a while before he took stock of his bearings and was surprised to find himself before the
cathedral. Its twisted spires were covered with statues and scrollwork. Snarling gargoyles crouched
along the eaves. Fantastic beasts writhed on the walls, and heroes and kings marched along their bottom
edges, frozen in cold marble. Ribbed arches and tall stained-glass windows lined the cathedral’s sides,
along with columns of differing sizes. A lonely turret helmed the building like a mast.
Recessed in shadow at the cathedral’s front was an iron-bound door inlaid with a row of silver script
that Eragon recognized as the ancient language. As best he could tell, it read:May thee who enter here
understand thine impermanence and forget thine attachments to that which is beloved.
The entire building sent a shiver down Eragon’s spine. There was something menacing about it, as if it
were a predator crouched in the city, waiting for its next victim.
A broad row of steps led to the cathedral’s entrance. Eragon solemnly ascended them and stopped
before the door.I wonder if I can go in? Almost guiltily he pushed on the door. It swung open smoothly,
gliding on oiled hinges. He stepped inside.
The silence of a forgotten tomb filled the empty cathedral. The air was chill and dry. Bare walls extended
to a vaulted ceiling that was so high Eragon felt no taller than an ant. Stained-glass windows depicting
scenes of anger, hate, and remorse pierced the walls, while spectral beams of light washed sections of the
granite pews with transparent hues, leaving the rest in shadow. His hands were shaded a deep blue.
Between the windows stood statues with rigid, pale eyes. He returned their stern gazes, then slowly trod
up the center row, afraid to break the quiet. His leather boots padded noiselessly on the polished stone
floor.

The altar was a great slab of stone devoid of adornment. A solitary finger of light fell upon it, illuminating
motes of golden dust floating in the air. Behind the altar, the pipes of a wind organ pierced the ceiling and
opened themselves to the elements. The instrument would play its music only when a gale rocked
Dras-Leona.
Out of respect, Eragon knelt before the altar and bowed his head. He did not pray but paid homage to
the cathedral itself. The sorrows of the lives it had witnessed, as well as the unpleasantness of the
elaborate pageantry that played out between its walls, emanated from the stones. It was a forbidding
place, bare and cold. In that chilling touch, though, came a glimpse of eternity and perhaps the powers
that lay there.
Finally Eragon inclined his head and rose. Calm and grave, he whispered words to himself in the ancient
language, then turned to leave. He froze. His heart jumped, hammering like a drum.
The Ra’zac stood at the cathedral’s entrance, watching him. Their swords were drawn, keen edges
bloody in a crimson light. A sibilant hiss came from the smaller Ra’zac. Neither of them moved.
Rage welled up in Eragon. He had chased the Ra’zac for so many weeks that the pain of their
murderous deed had dulled within him. But his vengeance was at hand. His wrath exploded like a
volcano, fueled even more by his pent-up fury at the slaves’ plight. A roar broke from his lips, echoing
like a thunderstorm as he snatched his bow from his back. Deftly, he fit an arrow to the string and loosed
it. Two more followed an instant later.
The Ra’zac leapt away from the arrows with inhuman swiftness. They hissed as they ran up the aisle
between the pews, cloaks flapping like raven wings. Eragon reached for another arrow, but caution
stayed his hand.If they knew where to find me, Brom is in danger as well! I must warn him! Then, to
Eragon’s horror, a line of soldiers filed into the cathedral, and he glimpsed a field of uniforms jostling
outside the doorway.
Eragon gazed hungrily at the charging Ra’zac, then swept around, searching for means of escape. A
vestibule to the left of the altar caught his attention. He bounded through the archway and dashed down a
corridor that led to a priory with a belfry. The patter of the Ra’zac’s feet behind him made him quicken
his pace until the hall abruptly ended with a closed door.
He pounded against it, trying to break it open, but the wood was too strong. The Ra’zac were nearly
upon him. Frantic, he sucked in his breath and barked, “Jierda!” With a flash, the door splintered into
pieces and fell to the floor. Eragon jumped into the small room and continued running.
He sped through several chambers, startling a group of priests. Shouts and curses followed him. The
priory bell tolled an alarm. Eragon dodged through a kitchen, passed a pair of monks, then slipped
through a side door. He skidded to stop in a garden surrounded by a high brick wall devoid of
handholds. There were no other exits.
Eragon turned to leave, but there was a low hiss as the Ra’zac shouldered aside the door. Desperate, he
rushed at the wall, arms pumping. Magic could not help him here—if he used it to break through the wall,
he would be too tired to run.
He jumped. Even with his arms outstretched, only his fingertips cleared the edge of the wall. The rest of
his body smashed against the bricks, driving out his breath. Eragon gasped and hung there, struggling not
to fall. The Ra’zac prowled into the garden, swinging their heads from side to side like wolfhounds

sniffing for prey.
Eragon sensed their approach and heaved with his arms. His shoulders shrieked with pain as he
scrambled onto the wall and dropped to the other side. He stumbled, then regained his balance and
darted down an alley just as the Ra’zac leapt over the wall. Galvanized, Eragon put on another burst of
speed.
He ran for over a mile before he had to stop and catch his breath. Unsure if he had lost the Ra’zac, he
found a crowded marketplace and dived under a parked wagon.How did they find me? he wondered,
panting.They shouldn’t have known where I was… unless something happened to Brom! He reached out
with his mind to Saphira and said,The Ra’zac found me. We’re all in danger! Check if Brom’s all right. If
he is, warn him and have him meet me at the inn. And be ready to fly here as fast as you can. We may
need your help to escape.
She was silent, then said curtly,He’ll meet you at the inn. Don’t stop moving; you’re in great danger.
“Don’t I know it,” muttered Eragon as he rolled out from under the wagon. He hurried back to the
Golden Globe, quickly packed their belongings, saddled the horses, then led them to the street. Brom
soon arrived, staff in hand, scowling dangerously. He swung onto Snowfire and asked, “What
happened?”
“I was in the cathedral when the Ra’zac just appeared behind me,” said Eragon, climbing onto Cadoc. “I
ran back as fast as possible, but they could be here at any second. Saphira will join us once we’re out of
Dras-Leona.”
“We have to get outside the city walls before they close the gates, if they haven’t already,” said Brom.
“If they’re shut, it’ll be nigh impossible for us to leave. Whatever you do, don’t get separated from me.”
Eragon stiffened as ranks of soldiers marched down one end of the street.
Brom cursed, lashed Snowfire with his reins, and galloped away. Eragon bent low over Cadoc and
followed. They nearly crashed several times during the wild, hazardous ride, plunging through masses of
people that clogged the streets as they neared the city wall. When the gates finally came into view,
Eragon pulled on Cadoc’s reins with dismay. The gates were already half closed, and a double line of
pikemen blocked their way.
“They’ll cut us to pieces!” he exclaimed.
“We have to try and make it,” said Brom, his voice hard. “I’ll deal with the men, but you have to keep
the gates open for us.” Eragon nodded, gritted his teeth, and dug his heels into Cadoc.
They plowed toward the line of unwavering soldiers, who lowered their pikes toward the horses’ chests
and braced the weapons against the ground. Though the horses snorted with fear, Eragon and Brom held
them in place. Eragon heard the soldiers shout but kept his attention on the gates inching shut.
As they neared the sharp pikes, Brom raised his hand and spoke. The words struck with precision; the
soldiers fell to each side as if their legs had been cut out from under them. The gap between the gates
shrank by the second. Hoping that the effort would not prove too much for him, Eragon drew on his
power and shouted, “Du grind huildr!”
A deep grating sound emanated from the gates as they trembled, then ground to a stop. The crowd and
guards fell silent, staring with amazement. With a clatter of the horses’ hooves, Brom and Eragon shot out

Page 157

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

from behind Dras-Leona’s wall. The instant they were free, Eragon released the gates. They shuddered,
then boomed shut.
He swayed with the expected fatigue but managed to keep riding. Brom watched him with concern.
Their flight continued through the outskirts of Dras-Leona as alarm trumpets sounded on the city wall.
Saphira was waiting for them by the edge of the city, hidden behind some trees. Her eyes burned; her tail
whipped back and forth. “Go, ride her,” said Brom. “And this time stay in the air, no matter what
happens to me. I’ll head south. Fly nearby; I don’t care if Saphira’s seen.” Eragon quickly mounted
Saphira. As the ground dwindled away beneath him, he watched Brom gallop along the road.
Are you all right?asked Saphira.
Yes,said Eragon.But only because we were very lucky.
A puff of smoke blew from her nostrils.All the time we’ve spent searching for the Ra’zac was useless.
I know,he said, letting his head sag against her scales.If the Ra’zac had been the only enemies back
there, I would have stayed and fought, but with all the soldiers on their side, it was hardly a fair match!
You understand that there will be talk of us now? This was hardly an unobtrusive escape. Evading the
Empire will be harder than ever.There was an edge to her voice that he was unaccustomed to.
I know.
They flew low and fast over the road. Leona Lake receded behind them; the land became dry and rocky
and filled with tough, sharp bushes and tall cactuses. Clouds darkened the sky. Lightning flashed in the
distance. As the wind began to howl, Saphira glided steeply down to Brom. He stopped the horses and
asked, “What’s wrong?”
“The wind’s too strong.”
“It’s not that bad,” objected Brom.
“It is up there,” said Eragon, pointing at the sky.
Brom swore and handed him Cadoc’s reins. They trotted away with Saphira following on foot, though
on the ground she had difficulty keeping up with the horses.
The gale grew stronger, flinging dirt through the air and twisting like a dervish. They wrapped scarves
around their heads to protect their eyes. Brom’s robe flapped in the wind while his beard whipped about
as if it had a life of its own. Though it would make them miserable, Eragon hoped it would rain so their
tracks would be obliterated.
Soon darkness forced them to stop. With only the stars to guide them, they left the road and made camp
behind two boulders. It was too dangerous to light a fire, so they ate cold food while Saphira sheltered
them from the wind.
After the sparse dinner, Eragon asked bluntly, “How did they find us?”
Brom started to light his pipe, but thought better of it and put it away. “One of the palace servants
warned me there were spies among them. Somehow word of me and my questions must have reached

Page 158

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Tábor… and through him, the Ra’zac.”
“We can’t go back to Dras-Leona, can we?” asked Eragon.
Brom shook his head. “Not for a few years.”
Eragon held his head between his hands. “Then should we draw the Ra’zac out? If we let Saphira be
seen, they’ll come running to wherever she is.”
“And when they do, there will be fifty soldiers with them,” said Brom. “At any rate, this isn’t the time to
discuss it. Right now we have to concentrate on staying alive. Tonight will be the most dangerous
because the Ra’zac will be hunting us in the dark, when they are strongest. We’ll have to trade watches
until morning.”
“Right,” said Eragon, standing. He hesitated and squinted. His eyes had caught a flicker of movement, a
small patch of color that stood out from the surrounding nightscape. He stepped toward the edge of their
camp, trying to see it better.
“What is it?” asked Brom as he unrolled his blankets.
Eragon stared into the darkness, then turned back. “I don’t know. I thought I saw something. It must
have been a bird.” Pain erupted in the back of his head, and Saphira roared. Then Eragon toppled to the
ground, unconscious.
THERA’ZAC’SREVENGE
Adull throbbing roused Eragon. Every time blood pulsed through his head it brought a fresh wave of
pain. He cracked his eyes open and winced; tears rushed to his eyes as he looked directly into a bright
lantern. He blinked and looked away. When he tried to sit up, he realized that his hands were tied behind
his back.
He turned lethargically and saw Brom’s arms. Eragon was relieved to see that they were bound
together. Why was that? He struggled to figure it out until the thought suddenly came to him,They
wouldn’t tie up a dead man!But then who were “they”? He swiveled his head further, then stopped as a
pair of black boots entered his vision.
Eragon looked up, right into the cowled face of a Ra’zac. Fear jolted through him. He reached for the
magic and started to voice a word that would kill the Ra’zac, but then halted, puzzled. He could not
remember the word. Frustrated, he tried again, only to feel it slip out of his grasp.
Above him the Ra’zac laughed chillingly. “The drug is working, yesss? I think you will not be bothering
us again.”
There was a rattle off to the left, and Eragon was appalled to see the second Ra’zac fit a muzzle over
Saphira’s head. Her wings were pinioned to her sides by black chains; there were shackles on her legs.
Eragon tried to contact her, but felt nothing.
“She was most cooperative once we threatened to kill you,” hissed the Ra’zac. Squatting by the lantern,
he rummaged through Eragon’s bags, examining and discarding various items until he removed Zar’roc.
“What a pretty thing for one so… insignificant. Maybe I will keep it.” He leaned closer and sneered, “Or
maybe, if you behave, our master will let you polish it.” His moist breath smelled like raw meat.

Page 159

Then he turned the sword over in his hands and screeched as he saw the symbol on the scabbard. His
companion rushed over. They stood over the sword, hissing and clicking. At last they faced Eragon.
“You will serve our master very well, yesss.”
Eragon forced his thick tongue to form words: “If I do, I will kill you.”
They chuckled coldly. “Oh no, we are too valuable. But you… you aredisposable. ” A deep snarl came
from Saphira; smoke roiled from her nostrils. The Ra’zac did not seem to care.
Their attention was diverted when Brom groaned and rolled onto his side. One of the Ra’zac grabbed
his shirt and thrust him effortlessly into the air. “It’sss wearing off.”
“Give him more.”
“Let’sss just kill him,” said the shorter Ra’zac. “He has caused us much grief.”
The taller one ran his finger down his sword. “A good plan. But remember, the king’s instructions were
to keep themalive. ”
“We can sssay he was killed when we captured them.”
“And what of thisss one?” the Ra’zac asked, pointing his sword at Eragon. “If he talksss?”
His companion laughed and drew a wicked dagger. “He would not dare.”
There was a long silence, then, “Agreed.”
They dragged Brom to the center of the camp and shoved him to his knees. Brom sagged to one side.
Eragon watched with growing fear.I have to get free! He wrenched at the ropes, but they were too
strong to break. “None of that now,” said the tall Ra’zac, poking him with a sword. He nosed the air and
sniffed; something seemed to trouble him.
The other Ra’zac growled, yanked Brom’s head back, and swept the dagger toward his exposed throat.
At that very moment a low buzz sounded, followed by the Ra’zac’s howl. An arrow protruded from his
shoulder. The Ra’zac nearest Eragon dropped to the ground, barely avoiding a second arrow. He
scuttled to his wounded companion, and they glared into the darkness, hissing angrily. They made no
move to stop Brom as he blearily staggered upright. “Get down!” cried Eragon.
Brom wavered, then tottered toward Eragon. As more arrows hissed into the camp from the unseen
attackers, the Ra’zac rolled behind some boulders. There was a lull, then arrows came from the opposite
direction. Caught by surprise, the Ra’zac reacted slowly. Their cloaks were pierced in several places,
and a shattered arrow buried itself in one’s arm.
With a wild cry, the smaller Ra’zac fled toward the road, kicking Eragon viciously in the side as he
passed. His companion hesitated, then grabbed the dagger from the ground and raced after him. As he
left the camp, he hurled the knife at Eragon.
A strange light suddenly burned in Brom’s eyes. He threw himself in front of Eragon, his mouth open in a
soundless snarl. The dagger struck him with a soft thump, and he landed heavily on his shoulder. His head
lolled limply.

“No!” screamed Eragon, though he was doubled over in pain. He heard footsteps, then his eyes closed
and he knew no more.
MURTAGH
For a long while, Eragon was aware only of the burning in his side. Each breath was painful. It felt as
though he had been the one stabbed, not Brom. His sense of time was skewed; it was hard to tell if
weeks had gone by, or only a few minutes. When consciousness finally came to him, he opened his eyes
and peered curiously at a campfire several feet away. His hands were still tied together, but the drug must
have worn off because he could think clearly again.Saphira, are you injured?
No, but you and Brom are.She was crouched over Eragon, wings spread protectively on either side.
Saphira, you didn’t make that fire, did you? And you couldn’t have gotten out of those chains by
yourself.
No.
I didn’t think so.Eragon struggled to his knees and saw a young man sitting on the far side of the fire.
The stranger, dressed in battered clothes, exuded a calm, assured air. In his hands was a bow, at his
side a long hand-and-a-half sword. A white horn bound with silver fittings lay in his lap, and the hilt of a
dagger protruded from his boot. His serious face and fierce eyes were framed by locks of brown hair.
He appeared to be a few years older than Eragon and perhaps an inch or so taller. Behind him a gray
war-horse was picketed. The stranger watched Saphira warily.
“Who are you?” asked Eragon, taking a shallow breath.
The man’s hands tightened on his bow. “Murtagh.” His voice was low and controlled, but curiously
emotional.
Eragon pulled his hands underneath his legs so they were in front of him. He clenched his teeth as his
side flared with pain. “Why did you help us?”
“You aren’t the only enemies the Ra’zac have. I was tracking them.”
“You know who they are?”
“Yes.”
Eragon concentrated on the ropes that bound his wrists and reached for the magic. He hesitated, aware
of Murtagh’s eyes on him, then decided it didn’t matter. “Jierda!” he grunted. The ropes snapped off his
wrists. He rubbed his hands to get the blood flowing.
Murtagh sucked in his breath. Eragon braced himself and tried to stand, but his ribs seared with agony.
He fell back, gasping between clenched teeth. Murtagh tried to come to his aid, but Saphira stopped him
with a growl. “I would have helped you earlier, but your dragon wouldn’t let me near you.”
“Her name’s Saphira,” said Eragon tightly.Now let him by! I can’t do this alone. Besides, he saved our
lives. Saphira growled again, but folded her wings and backed away. Murtagh eyed her flatly as he

Page 161

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

stepped forward.
He grasped Eragon’s arm, gently pulling him to his feet. Eragon yelped and would have fallen without
support. They went to the fire, where Brom lay on his back. “How is he?” asked Eragon.
“Bad,” said Murtagh, lowering him to the ground. “The knife went right between his ribs. You can look
at him in a minute, but first we’d better see how much damage the Ra’zac did to you.” He helped Eragon
remove his shirt, then whistled. “Ouch!”
“Ouch,” agreed Eragon weakly. A blotchy bruise extended down his left side. The red, swollen skin was
broken in several places. Murtagh put a hand on the bruise and pressed lightly. Eragon yelled, and
Saphira growled a warning.
Murtagh glanced at Saphira as he grabbed a blanket. “I think you have some broken ribs. It’s hard to
tell, but at least two, maybe more. You’re lucky you’re not coughing up blood.” He tore the blanket into
strips and bound Eragon’s chest.
Eragon slipped the shirt back on. “Yes… I’m lucky.” He took a shallow breath, sidled over to Brom,
and saw that Murtagh had cut open the side of his robe to bandage the wound. With trembling fingers, he
undid the bandage.
“I wouldn’t do that,” warned Murtagh. “He’ll bleed to death without it.”
Eragon ignored him and pulled the cloth away from Brom’s side. The wound was short and thin, belying
its depth. Blood streamed out of it. As he had learned when Garrow was injured, a wound inflicted by
the Ra’zac was slow to heal.
He peeled off his gloves while furiously searching his mind for the healing words Brom had taught him.
Help me, Saphira, he implored.I am too weak to do this alone.
Saphira crouched next to him, fixing her eyes on Brom.I am here, Eragon. As her mind joined his, new
strength infused his body. Eragon drew upon their combined power and focused it on the words. His
hand trembled as he held it over the wound. “Waíse heill!” he said. His palm glowed, and Brom’s skin
flowed together, as if it had never been broken. Murtagh watched the entire process.
It was over quickly. As the light vanished, Eragon sat, feeling sick.We’ve never done that before, he
said.
Saphira nodded.Together we can cast spells that are beyond either of us.
Murtagh examined Brom’s side and asked, “Is he completely healed?”
“I can only mend what is on the surface. I don’t know enough to fix whatever’s damaged inside. It’s up
to him now. I’ve done all I can.” Eragon closed his eyes for a moment, utterly weary. “My… my head
seems to be floating in clouds.”
“You probably need to eat,” said Murtagh. “I’ll make soup.”
While Murtagh fixed the meal, Eragon wondered who this stranger was. His sword and bow were of the
finest make, as was his horn. Either he was a thief or accustomed to money—and lots of it.Why was he
hunting the Ra’zac? What have they done to make him an enemy? I wonder if he works for the Varden?

Page 162

Murtagh handed him a bowl of broth. Eragon spooned it down and asked, “How long has it been since
the Ra’zac fled?”
“A few hours.”
“We have to go before they return with reinforcements.”
“You might be able to travel,” said Murtagh, then gestured at Brom, “but he can’t. You don’t get up and
ride away after being stabbed between the ribs.”
If we make a litter, can you carry Brom with your claws like you did with Garrow?Eragon asked
Saphira.
Yes, but landing will be awkward.
As long as it can be done.Eragon said to Murtagh, “Saphira can carry him, but we need a litter. Can you
make one? I don’t have the strength.”
“Wait here.” Murtagh left the camp, sword drawn. Eragon hobbled to his bags and picked up his bow
from where it had been thrown by the Ra’zac. He strung it, found his quiver, then retrieved Zar’roc,
which lay hidden in shadow. Last, he got a blanket for the litter.
Murtagh returned with two saplings. He laid them parallel on the ground, then lashed the blanket
between the poles. After he carefully tied Brom to the makeshift litter, Saphira grasped the saplings and
laboriously took flight. “I never thought I would see a sight like that,” Murtagh said, an odd note in his
voice.
As Saphira disappeared into the dark sky, Eragon limped to Cadoc and hoisted himself painfully into the
saddle. “Thanks for helping us. You should leave now. Ride as far away from us as you can. You’ll be in
danger if the Empire finds you with us. We can’t protect you, and I wouldn’t see harm come to you on
our account.”
“A pretty speech,” said Murtagh, grinding out the fire, “but where will you go? Is there a place nearby
that you can rest in safety?”
“No,” admitted Eragon.
Murtagh’s eyes glinted as he fingered the hilt of his sword. “In that case, I think I’ll accompany you until
you’re out of danger. I’ve no better place to be. Besides, if I stay with you, I might get another shot at
the Ra’zac sooner than if I were on my own. Interesting things are bound to happen around a Rider.”
Eragon wavered, unsure if he should accept help from a complete stranger. Yet he was unpleasantly
aware that he was too weak to force the issue either way.If Murtagh proves untrustworthy, Saphira can
always chase him away. “Join us if you wish.” He shrugged.
Murtagh nodded and mounted his gray war-horse. Eragon grabbed Snowfire’s reins and rode away
from the camp, into the wilderness. An oxbow moon provided wan light, but he knew that it would only
make it easier for the Ra’zac to track them.
Though Eragon wanted to question Murtagh further, he kept silent, conserving his energy for riding.

Near dawn Saphira said,I must stop. My wings are tired and Brom needs attention. I discovered a good
place to stay, about two miles ahead of where you are.
They found her sitting at the base of a broad sandstone formation that curved out of the ground like a
great hill. Its sides were pocked with caves of varying sizes. Similar domes were scattered across the
land. Saphira looked pleased with herself.I found a cave that can’t be seen from the ground. It’s large
enough for all of us, including the horses. Follow me. She turned and climbed up the sandstone, her sharp
claws digging into the rock. The horses had difficulty, as their shod hooves could not grip the sandstone.
Eragon and Murtagh had to pull and shove the animals for almost an hour before they managed to reach
the cave.
The cavern was a good hundred feet long and more than twenty feet wide, yet it had a small opening that
would protect them from bad weather and prying eyes. Darkness swallowed the far end, clinging to the
walls like mats of soft black wool.
“Impressive,” said Murtagh. “I’ll gather wood for a fire.” Eragon hurried to Brom. Saphira had set him
on a small rock ledge at the rear of the cave. Eragon clasped Brom’s limp hand and anxiously watched
his craggy face. After a few minutes, he sighed and went to the fire Murtagh had built.
They ate quietly, then tried to give Brom water, but the old man would not drink. Stymied, they spread
out their bedrolls and slept.
LEGACY OF ARIDER
Wake up, Eragon.He stirred and groaned.
I need your help. Something is wrong!Eragon tried to ignore the voice and return to sleep.
Arise!
Go away,he grumbled.
Eragon!A bellow rang in the cave. He bolted upright, fumbling for his bow. Saphira was crouched over
Brom, who had rolled off the ledge and was thrashing on the cave floor. His face was contorted in a
grimace; his fists were clenched. Eragon rushed over, fearing the worst.
“Help me hold him down. He’s going to hurt himself!” he cried to Murtagh, clasping Brom’s arms. His
side burned sharply as the old man spasmed. Together they restrained Brom until his convulsions ceased.
Then they carefully returned him to the ledge.
Eragon touched Brom’s forehead. The skin was so hot that the heat could be felt an inch away. “Get me
water and a cloth,” he said worriedly. Murtagh brought them, and Eragon gently bathed Brom’s face,
trying to cool him down. With the cave quiet again, he noticed the sun shining outside.How long did we
sleep? he asked Saphira.
A good while. I’ve been watching Brom for most of that time. He was fine until a minute ago when he
started thrashing. I woke you once he fell to the floor.
He stretched, wincing as his ribs twinged painfully. A hand suddenly gripped his shoulder. Brom’s eyes
snapped opened and fixed a glassy stare on Eragon. “You!” he gasped. “Bring me the wineskin!”

Page 164

“Brom?” exclaimed Eragon, pleased to hear him talk. “You shouldn’t drink wine; it’ll only make you
worse.”
“Bring it, boy—just bring it…,” sighed Brom. His hand slipped off Eragon’s shoulder.
“I’ll be right back—hold on.” Eragon dashed to the saddlebags and rummaged through them frantically.
“I can’t find it!” he cried, looking around desperately.
“Here, take mine,” said Murtagh, holding out a leather skin.
Eragon grabbed it and returned to Brom. “I have the wine,” he said, kneeling. Murtagh retreated to the
cave’s mouth so they could have privacy.
Brom’s next words were faint and indistinct. “Good…” He moved his arm weakly. “Now… wash my
right hand with it.”
“What—” Eragon started to ask.
“No questions! I haven’t time.” Mystified, Eragon unstoppered the wineskin and poured the liquid onto
Brom’s palm. He rubbed it into the old man’s skin, spreading it around the fingers and over the back of
the hand. “More,” croaked Brom. Eragon splashed wine onto his hand again. He scrubbed vigorously as
a brown dye floated off Brom’s palm, then stopped, his mouth agape with amazement. There on Brom’s
palm was the gedwëy ignasia.
“You’re a Rider?” he asked incredulously.
A painful smile flickered on Brom’s face. “Once upon a time that was true… but no more. When I was
young… younger than you are now, I was chosen… chosen by the Riders to join their ranks. While they
trained me, I became friends with another apprentice… Morzan, before he was a Forsworn.” Eragon
gasped—that had been over a hundred years ago. “But then he betrayed us to Galbatorix… and in the
fighting at Dorú Areaba—Vroengard’s city—my young dragon was killed. Her name… was Saphira.”
“Why didn’t you tell me this before?” asked Eragon softly.
Brom laughed. “Because… there was no need to.” He stopped. His breathing was labored; his hands
were clenched. “I am old, Eragon… so old. Though my dragon was killed, my life has been longer than
most. You don’t know what it is to reach my age, look back, and realize that you don’t remember much
of it; then to look forward and know that many years still lie ahead of you… After all this time I still
grieve for my Saphira… and hate Galbatorix for what he tore from me.” His feverish eyes drilled into
Eragon as he said fiercely, “Don’t let that happen to you. Don’t! Guard Saphira with your life, for without
her it’s hardly worth living.”
“You shouldn’t talk like this. Nothing’s going to happen to her,” said Eragon, worried.
Brom turned his head to the side. “Perhaps I am rambling.” His gaze passed blindly over Murtagh, then
he focused on Eragon. Brom’s voice grew stronger. “Eragon! I cannot last much longer. This… this is a
grievous wound; it saps my strength. I have not the energy to fight it… Before I go, will you take my
blessing?”
“Everything will be all right,” said Eragon, tears in his eyes. “You don’t have to do this.”

“It is the way of things… I must. Will you take my blessing?” Eragon bowed his head and nodded,
overcome. Brom placed a trembling hand on his brow. “Then I give it to you. May the coming years
bring you great happiness.” He motioned for Eragon to bend closer. Very quietly, he whispered seven
words from the ancient language, then even more softly told him what they meant. “That is all I can give
you… Use them only in great need.”
Brom blindly turned his eyes to the ceiling. “And now,” he murmured, “for the greatest adventure of
all…”
Weeping, Eragon held his hand, comforting him as best he could. His vigil was unwavering and steadfast,
unbroken by food or drink. As the long hours passed, a gray pallor crept over Brom, and his eyes slowly
dimmed. His hands grew icy; the air around him took on an evil humor. Powerless to help, Eragon could
only watch as the Ra’zac’s wound took its toll.
The evening hours were young and the shadows long when Brom suddenly stiffened. Eragon called his
name and cried for Murtagh’s help, but they could do nothing. As a barren silence dampened the air,
Brom locked his eyes with Eragon’s. Then contentment spread across the old man’s face, and a whisper
of breath escaped his lips. And so it was that Brom the storyteller died.

With shaking fingers, Eragon closed Brom’s eyes and stood. Saphira raised her head behind him and
roared mournfully at the sky, keening her lamentation. Tears rolled down Eragon’s cheeks as a sense of
horrible loss bled through him. Haltingly, he said, “We have to bury him.”
“We might be seen,” warned Murtagh.
“I don’t care!”
Murtagh hesitated, then bore Brom’s body out of the cave, along with his sword and staff. Saphira
followed them. “To the top,” Eragon said thickly, indicating the crown of the sandstone hill.
“We can’t dig a grave out of stone,” objected Murtagh.
“I can do it.”
Eragon climbed onto the smooth hilltop, struggling because of his ribs. There, Murtagh lay Brom on the
stone.
Eragon wiped his eyes and fixed his gaze on the sandstone. Gesturing with his hand, he said, “Moi
stenr!” The stone rippled. It flowed like water, forming a body-length depression in the hilltop. Molding
the sandstone like wet clay, he raised waist-high walls around it.
They laid Brom inside the unfinished sandstone vault with his staff and sword. Stepping back, Eragon
again shaped the stone with magic. It joined over Brom’s motionless face and flowed upward into a tall
faceted spire. As a final tribute, Eragon set runes into the stone:

HERELIESBROM

Who was a Dragon Rider
And like a father
To me.
May his name live on in glory.

Then he bowed his head and mourned freely. He stood like a living statue until evening, when light faded
from the land.
That night he dreamed of the imprisoned woman again.
He could tell that something was wrong with her. Her breathing was irregular, and she shook—whether
from cold or pain, he did not know. In the semidarkness of the cell, the only thing clearly illuminated was
her hand, which hung over the edge of the cot. A dark liquid dripped from the tips of her fingers. Eragon
knew it was blood.
DIAMONDTOMB
When Eragon woke, his eyes were gritty, his body stiff. The cave was empty except for the horses. The
litter was gone; no sign of Brom remained. He walked to the entrance and sat on the pitted sandstone.So
the witch Angela was correct—there was a death in my future, he thought, staring bleakly at the land.
The topaz sun brought a desert heat to the early morning.
A tear slid down his listless face and evaporated in the sunlight, leaving a salty crust on his skin. He
closed his eyes and absorbed the warmth, emptying his mind. With a fingernail, he aimlessly scratched the
sandstone. When he looked, he saw that he had writtenWhy me?
He was still there when Murtagh climbed up to the cave, carrying a pair of rabbits. Without a word he
seated himself by Eragon. “How are you?” he asked.
“Very ill.”
Murtagh considered him thoughtfully. “Will you recover?” Eragon shrugged. After a few minutes of
reflection, Murtagh said, “I dislike asking this at such a time, but I must know… Is your Bromthe Brom?
The one who helped steal a dragon egg from the king, chased it across the Empire, and killed Morzan in
a duel? I heard you say his name, and I read the inscription you put on his grave, but I must know for
certain, Was that he?”
“It was,” said Eragon softly. A troubled expression settled on Murtagh’s face. “How do you know all
that? You talk about things that are secret to most, and you were trailing the Ra’zac right when we
needed help. Are you one of the Varden?”
Murtagh’s eyes became inscrutable orbs. “I’m running away, like you.” There was restrained sorrow in
his words. “I do not belong to either the Varden or the Empire. Nor do I owe allegiance to any man but
myself. As for my rescuing you, I will admit that I’ve heard whispered tales of a new Rider and reasoned
that by following the Ra’zac I might discover if they were true.”

“I thought you wanted to kill the Ra’zac,” said Eragon.
Murtagh smiled grimly. “I do, but if I had, I never would have met you.”
But Brom would still be alive… I wish he were here. He would know whether to trust Murtagh.Eragon
remembered how Brom had sensed Trevor’s intentions in Daret and wondered if he could do the same
with Murtagh. He reached for Murtagh’s consciousness, but his probe abruptly ran into an iron-hard
wall, which he tried to circumvent. Murtagh’s entire mind was fortified.How did he learn to do that?
Brom said that few people, if any, could keep others out of their mind without training. So who is
Murtagh to have this ability? Pensive and lonely, Eragon asked, “Where is Saphira?”
“I don’t know,” said Murtagh. “She followed me for a time when I went hunting, then flew off on her
own. I haven’t seen her since before noon.” Eragon rocked onto his feet and returned to the cave.
Murtagh followed. “What are you going to do now?”
“I’m not sure.”And I don’t want to think about it either. He rolled up his blankets and tied them to
Cadoc’s saddlebags. His ribs hurt. Murtagh went to prepare the rabbits. As Eragon shifted things in his
bags, he uncovered Zar’roc. The red sheath glinted brightly. He took out the sword… weighed it in his
hands.
He had never carried Zar’roc nor used it in combat—except when he and Brom had sparred—because
he had not wanted people to see it. That concerned Eragon no more. The Ra’zac had seemed surprised
and frightened by the sword; that was more than enough reason for him to wear it. With a shudder he
pulled off his bow and belted on Zar’roc.From this moment on, I’ll live by the sword. Let the whole
world see what I am. I have no fear. I am a Rider now, fully and completely.
He sorted through Brom’s bags but found only clothes, a few odd items, and a small pouch of coins.
Eragon took the map of Alagaësia and put the bags away, then crouched by the fire. Murtagh’s eyes
narrowed as he looked up from the rabbit he was skinning. “That sword. May I see it?” he asked, wiping
his hands.
Eragon hesitated, reluctant to relinquish the weapon for even a moment, then nodded. Murtagh
examined the symbol on the blade intently. His face darkened. “Where did you get this?”
“Brom gave it to me. Why?”
Murtagh shoved the sword back and crossed his arms angrily. He was breathing hard. “That sword,” he
said with emotion, “was once as well known as its owner. The last Rider to carry it was Morzan—a
brutal, savage man. I thought you were a foe of the Empire, yet here I find you bearing one of the
Forsworn’s bloody swords!”
Eragon stared at Zar’roc with shock. He realized that Brom must have taken it from Morzan after they
fought in Gil’ead. “Brom never told me where it came from,” he said truthfully. “I had no idea it was
Morzan’s.”
“He never told you?” asked Murtagh, a note of disbelief in his voice. Eragon shook his head. “That’s
strange. I can think of no reason for him to have concealed it.”
“Neither can I. But then, he kept many secrets,” said Eragon. It felt unsettling to hold the sword of the
man who had betrayed the Riders to Galbatorix.This blade probably killed many Riders in its time, he
thought with revulsion.And worse, dragons! “Even so, I’m going to carry it. I don’t have a sword of my

Page 168

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

own. Until such time as I get one, I’ll use Zar’roc.”
Murtagh flinched as Eragon said the name. “It’s your choice,” he said. He returned to skinning, keeping
his gaze focused downward.
When the meal was ready, Eragon ate slowly, though he was quite hungry. The hot food made him feel
better. As they scraped out their bowls, he said, “I have to sell my horse.”
“Why not Brom’s?” asked Murtagh. He seemed to have gotten over his bad temper.
“Snowfire? Because Brom promised to take care of him. Since he… isn’t around, I’ll do it for him.”
Murtagh set his bowl on his lap. “If that’s what you want, I’m sure we can find a buyer in some town or
village.”
“We?” asked Eragon.
Murtagh looked at him sideways in a calculating way. “You won’t want to stay here for much longer. If
the Ra’zac are nearby, Brom’s tomb will be like a beacon for them.” Eragon had not thought of that.
“And your ribs are going to take time to heal. I know you can defend yourself with magic, but you need a
companion who can lift things and use a sword. I’m asking to travel with you, at least for the time being.
But I must warn you, the Empire is searching for me. There’ll be blood over it eventually.”
Eragon laughed weakly and found himself crying because it hurt so much. Once his breath was back, he
said, “I don’t care if the entire army is searching for you. You’re right. I do need help. I would be glad to
have you along, though I have to talk to Saphira about it. But I have to warnyou, Galbatorix justmight
send the entire army after me. You won’t be any safer with Saphira and me than if you were on your
own.”
“I know that,” said Murtagh with a quick grin. “But all the same, it won’t stop me.”
“Good.” Eragon smiled with gratitude.
While they spoke, Saphira crawled into the cave and greeted Eragon. She was glad to see him, but there
was deep sadness in her thoughts and words. She laid her big blue head on the floor and asked,Are you
well again?
Not quite.
I miss the old one.
As do I… I never suspected that he was a Rider. Brom! He really was an old man—as old as the
Forsworn. Everything he taught me about magic he must have learned from the Riders themselves.
Saphira shifted slightly.I knew what he was the moment he touched me at your farm.
And you didn’t tell me? Why?
He asked me not to, she said simply.
Eragon decided not to make an issue of it. Saphira never meant to hurt him. Brom kept more than that

secret,he told her, then explained about Zar’roc and Murtagh’s reaction to it.I understand now why
Brom didn’t explain Zar’roc’s origins when he gave it to me. If he had, I probably would have run away
from him at the first opportunity.
You would do well to rid yourself of that sword,she said with distaste.I know it’s a peerless weapon,
but you would be better off with a normal blade rather than Morzan’s butchery tool.
Perhaps. Saphira, where does our path go from here? Murtagh offered to come with us. I don’t know
his past, but he seems honest enough. Should we go to the Varden now? Only I don’t know how to find
them. Brom never told us.
He told me,said Saphira.
Eragon grew angry.Why did he trust you, but not me, with all this knowledge?
Her scales rustled over the dry rock as she stood above him, eyes profound.After we left Teirm and
were attacked by the Urgals, he told me many things, some of which I will not speak of unless necessary.
He was concerned about his own death and what would happen to you after it. One fact he imparted to
me was the name of a man, Dormnad, who lives in Gil’ead. He can help us find the Varden. Brom also
wanted you to know that of all the people in Alagaësia, he believed you were the best suited to inherit the
Riders’ legacy.
Tears welled in Eragon’s eyes. This was the highest praise he could have ever received from Brom.A
responsibility I will bear honorably.
Good.
We will go to Gil’ead, then,stated Eragon, strength and purpose returning to him.And what of Murtagh?
Do you think he should come with us?
We owe him our lives,said Saphira.But even if that weren’t so, he has seen both you and me. We should
keep him close so he doesn’t furnish the Empire with our location and descriptions, willingly or not.
He agreed with her, then told Saphira about his dream.What I saw disturbed me. I feel that time is
running out for her; something dreadful is going to happen soon. She’s in mortal danger—I’m sure of
it—but I don’t know how to find her! She could be anywhere.
What does your heart say?asked Saphira.
My heart died a while back,said Eragon with a hint of black humor.However, I think we should go north
to Gil’ead. With any luck, one of the towns or cities along our path is where this woman is being held.
I’m afraid that my next dream of her will show a grave. I couldn’t stand that.
Why?
I’m not sure,he said, shrugging.It’s just that when I see her, I feel as if she’s precious and shouldn’t be
lost… It’s very strange. Saphira opened her long mouth and laughed silently, fangs gleaming.What is it?
snapped Eragon. She shook her head and quietly padded away.
Eragon grumbled to himself, then told Murtagh what they had decided. Murtagh said, “If you find this
Dormnad and then continue on to the Varden, I will leave you. Encountering the Varden would be as

dangerous for me as walking unarmed into Urû’baen with a fanfare of trumpets to announce my arrival.”
“We won’t have to part anytime soon,” said Eragon. “It’s a long way to Gil’ead.” His voice cracked
slightly, and he squinted at the sun to distract himself. “We should leave before the day grows any older.”
“Are you strong enough to travel?” asked Murtagh, frowning.
“I have to do something or I’ll go crazy,” said Eragon brusquely. “Sparring, practicing magic, or sitting
around twiddling my thumbs aren’t good options right now, so I choose to ride.”
They doused the fire, packed, and led the horses out of the cave. Eragon handed Cadoc’s and
Snowfire’s reins to Murtagh, saying, “Go on, I’ll be right down.” Murtagh began the slow descent from
the cave.
Eragon struggled up the sandstone, resting when his side made it impossible to breathe. When he
reached the top, he found Saphira already there. They stood together before Brom’s grave and paid their
last respects.I can’t believe he’s gone… forever. As Eragon turned to depart, Saphira snaked out her
long neck to touch the tomb with the tip of her nose. Her sides vibrated as a low humming filled the air.
The sandstone around her nose shimmered like gilded dew, turning clear with dancing silver highlights.
Eragon watched in wonder as tendrils of white diamond twisted over the tomb’s surface in a web of
priceless filigree. Sparkling shadows were cast on the ground, reflecting splashes of brilliant colors that
shifted dazzlingly as the sandstone continued to change. With a satisfied snort, Saphira stepped back and
examined her handiwork.
The sculpted sandstone mausoleum of moments before had transformed into a sparkling gemstone
vault—under which Brom’s untouched face was visible. Eragon gazed with yearning at the old man, who
seemed to be only sleeping. “What did you do?” he asked Saphira with awe.
I gave him the only gift I could. Now time will not ravage him. He can rest in peace for eternity.
Thank you.Eragon put a hand on her side, and they left together.
CAPTURE ATGIL’EAD
Riding was extremely painful for Eragon—his broken ribs prevented them from going faster than a walk,
and it was impossible for him to breathe deeply without a burst of agony. Nevertheless, he refused to
stop. Saphira flew close by, her mind linked with his for solace and strength.
Murtagh rode confidently beside Cadoc, flowing smoothly with his horse’s movements. Eragon watched
the gray animal for a while. “You have a beautiful horse. What’s his name?”
“Tornac, after the man who taught me how to fight.” Murtagh patted the horse’s side. “He was given to
me when he was just a foal. You’d be hard pressed to find a more courageous and intelligent animal in all
of Alagaësia, Saphira excepted, of course.”
“He is a magnificent beast,” said Eragon admiringly.
Murtagh laughed. “Yes, but Snowfire is as close to his match as I’ve ever seen.”
They covered only a short distance that day, yet Eragon was glad to be on the move again. It kept his

mind off other, more morbid matters. They were riding through unsettled land. The road to Dras-Leona
was several leagues to their left. They would skirt the city by a wide margin on the way to Gil’ead, which
was almost as far to the north as Carvahall.

They sold Cadoc in a small village. As the horse was led away by his new owner, Eragon regretfully
pocketed the few coins he had gained from the transaction. It was difficult to relinquish Cadoc after
crossing half of Alagaësia—and outracing Urgals—on him.
The days rolled by unnoticed as their small group traveled in isolation. Eragon was pleased to find that
he and Murtagh shared many of the same interests; they spent hours debating the finer points of archery
and hunting.
There was one subject, however, they avoided discussing by unspoken consent: their pasts. Eragon did
not explain how he had found Saphira, met Brom, or where he came from. Murtagh was likewise mute
as to why the Empire was chasing him. It was a simple arrangement, but it worked.
Yet because of their proximity, it was inevitable that they learned about each other. Eragon was intrigued
by Murtagh’s familiarity with the power struggles and politics within the Empire. He seemed to know
what every noble and courtier was doing and how it affected everyone else. Eragon listened carefully,
suspicions whirling through his mind.
The first week went by without any sign of the Ra’zac, which allayed some of Eragon’s fears. Even so,
they still kept watches at night. Eragon had expected to encounter Urgals on the way to Gil’ead, but they
found no trace of them.I thought these remote places would be teeming with monsters, he mused.Still,
I’m not one to complain if they’ve gone elsewhere.
He dreamed of the woman no more. And though he tried to scry her, he saw only an empty cell.
Whenever they passed a town or city, he checked to see if it had a jail. If it did, he would disguise himself
and visit it, but she was not to be found. His disguises became increasingly elaborate as he saw notices
featuring his name and description—and offering a substantial reward for his capture—posted in various
towns.
Their travels north forced them toward the capital, Urû’baen. It was a heavily populated area, which
made it difficult to escape notice. Soldiers patrolled the roads and guarded the bridges. It took them
several tense, irritable days to skirt the capital.
Once they were safely past Urû’baen, they found themselves on the edge of a vast plain. It was the same
one that Eragon had crossed after leaving Palancar Valley, except now he was on the opposite side.
They kept to the perimeter of the plain and continued north, following the Ramr River.
Eragon’s sixteenth birthday came and went during this time. At Carvahall a celebration would have been
held for his entrance into manhood, but in the wilderness he did not even mention it to Murtagh.
At nearly six months of age, Saphira was much larger. Her wings were massive; every inch of them was
needed to lift her muscular body and thick bones. The fangs that jutted from her jaw were nearly as thick
around as Eragon’s fist, their points as sharp as Zar’roc.

Page 172

The day finally came when Eragon unwrapped his side for the last time. His ribs had healed completely,
leaving him with only a small scar where the Ra’zac’s boot had cut his side. As Saphira watched, he
stretched slowly, then with increasing vigor when there was no pain. He flexed his muscles, pleased. In an
earlier time he would have smiled, but after Brom’s death, such expressions did not come easily.
He tugged his tunic on and walked back to the small fire they had made. Murtagh sat next to it, whittling
a piece of wood. Eragon drew Zar’roc. Murtagh tensed, though his face remained calm. “Now that I am
strong enough, would you like to spar?” asked Eragon.
Murtagh tossed the wood to the side. “With sharpened swords? We could kill each other.”
“Here, give me your sword,” said Eragon. Murtagh hesitated, then handed over his long hand-and-a-half
sword. Eragon blocked the edges with magic, the way Brom had taught him. While Murtagh examined
the blade, Eragon said, “I can undo that once we’re finished.”
Murtagh checked the balance of his sword. Satisfied, he said, “It will do.” Eragon safed Zar’roc, settled
into a crouch, then swung at Murtagh’s shoulder. Their swords met in midair. Eragon disengaged with a
flourish, thrust, and then riposted as Murtagh parried, dancing away.
He’s fast!thought Eragon.
They struggled back and forth, trying to batter each other down. After a particularly intense series of
blows, Murtagh started laughing. Not only was it impossible for either of them to gain an advantage, but
they were so evenly matched that they tired at the same rate. Acknowledging with grins each other’s skill,
they fought on until their arms were leaden and sweat poured off their sides.
Finally Eragon called, “Enough, halt!” Murtagh stopped in mid-blow and sat down with a gasp. Eragon
staggered to the ground, his chest heaving. None of his fights with Brom had been this fierce.
As he gulped air, Murtagh exclaimed, “You’re amazing! I’ve studied swordplay all my life, but never
have I fought one like you. You could be the king’s weapon master if you wanted to.”
“You’re just as good,” observed Eragon, still panting. “The man who taught you, Tornac, could make a
fortune with a fencing school. People would come from all parts of Alagaësia to learn from him.”
“He’s dead,” said Murtagh shortly.
“I’m sorry.”
Thus it became their custom to fight in the evening, which kept them lean and fit, like a pair of matched
blades. With his return to health, Eragon also resumed practicing magic. Murtagh was curious about it
and soon revealed that he knew a surprising amount about how it worked, though he lacked the precise
details and could not use it himself. Whenever Eragon practiced speaking in the ancient language,
Murtagh would listen quietly, occasionally asking what a word meant.

On the outskirts of Gil’ead they stopped the horses side by side. It had taken them nearly a month to
reach it, during which time spring had finally nudged away the remnants of winter. Eragon had felt himself
changing during the trip, growing stronger and calmer. He still thought about Brom and spoke about him
with Saphira, but for the most part he tried not to awaken painful memories.

From a distance they could see the city was a rough, barbaric place, filled with log houses and yapping
dogs. There was a rambling stone fortress at its center. The air was hazy with blue smoke. The place
seemed more like a temporary trading post than a permanent city. Five miles beyond it was the hazy
outline of Isenstar Lake.
They decided to camp two miles from the city, for safety. While their dinner simmered, Murtagh said,
“I’m not sure you should be the one to go into Gil’ead.”
“Why? I can disguise myself well enough,” said Eragon. “And Dormnad will want to see the gedwëy
ignasia as proof that I really am a Rider.”
“Perhaps,” said Murtagh, “but the Empire wants you much more than me. If I’m captured, I could
eventually escape. But ifyou are taken, they’ll drag you to the king, where you’ll be in for a slow death by
torture—unless you join him. Plus, Gil’ead is one of the army’s major staging points. Those aren’t houses
out there; they’re barracks. Going in there would be like handing yourself to the king on a gilded platter.”
Eragon asked Saphira for her opinion. She wrapped her tail around his legs and lay next to him.You
shouldn’t have to ask me; he speaks sense. There are certain words I can give him that will convince
Dormnad of his truthfulness. And Murtagh’s right; if anyone is to risk capture it should be him, because
he would live through it.
He grimaced.I don’t like letting him put himself in danger for us. “All right, you can go,” he said
reluctantly. “But if anything goes wrong, I’m coming after you.”
Murtagh laughed. “That would be fit for a legend: how a lone Rider took on the king’s army
single-handedly.” He chuckled again and stood. “Is there anything I should know before going?”
“Shouldn’t we rest and wait until tomorrow?” asked Eragon cautiously.
“Why? The longer we stay here, the greater the chance that we’ll be discovered. If this Dormnad can
take you to the Varden, then he needs to be found as quickly as possible. Neither of us should remain
near Gil’ead longer than a few days.”
Again wisdom flies from his mouth,commented Saphira dryly. She told Eragon what should be said to
Dormnad, and he relayed the information to Murtagh.
“Very well,” said Murtagh, adjusting his sword. “Unless there’s trouble, I’ll be back within a couple of
hours. Make sure there’s some food left for me.” With a wave of his hand, he jumped onto Tornac and
rode away. Eragon sat by the fire, tapping Zar’roc’s pommel apprehensively.
Hours passed, but Murtagh did not return. Eragon paced around the fire, Zar’roc in hand, while Saphira
watched Gil’ead attentively. Only her eyes moved. Neither of them voiced their worries, though Eragon
unobtrusively prepared to leave—in case a detachment of soldiers left the city and headed toward their
camp.
Look,snapped Saphira.
Eragon swiveled toward Gil’ead, alert. He saw a distant horseman exit the city and ride furiously toward
their camp.I don’t like this, he said as he climbed onto Saphira.Be ready to fly.

Page 174

I’m prepared for more than that.
As the rider approached, Eragon recognized Murtagh bent low over Tornac. No one seemed to be
pursuing him, but he did not slow his reckless pace. He galloped into the camp and jumped to the
ground, drawing his sword. “What’s wrong?” asked Eragon.
Murtagh scowled. “Did anyone follow me from Gil’ead?”
“We didn’t see anyone.”
“Good. Then let me eat before I explain. I’m starving.” He seized a bowl and began eating with gusto.
After a few sloppy bites, he said through a full mouth, “Dormnad has agreed to meet us outside Gil’ead
at sunrise tomorrow. If he’s satisfied you really are a Rider and that it’s not a trap, he’ll take you to the
Varden.”
“Where are we supposed to meet him?” asked Eragon.
Murtagh pointed west. “On a small hill across the road.”
“So what happened?”
Murtagh spooned more food into his bowl. “It’s a rather simple thing, but all the more deadly because of
it: I was seen in the street by someone who knows me. I did the only thing I could and ran away. It was
too late, though; he recognized me.”
It was unfortunate, but Eragon was unsure how bad it really was. “Since I don’t know your friend, I
have to ask: Will he tell anyone?”
Murtagh gave a strained laugh. “If youhad met him, that wouldn’t need answering. His mouth is loosely
hinged and hangs open all the time, vomiting whatever happens to be in his mind. The question isn’t
whether he will tell people, butwhom he will tell. If word of this reaches the wrong ears, we’ll be in
trouble.”
“I doubt that soldiers will be sent to search for you in the dark,” Eragon pointed out. “We can at least
count on being safe until morning, and by then, if all goes well, we’ll be leaving with Dormnad.”
Murtagh shook his head. “No, only you will accompany him. As I said before, I won’t go to the
Varden.”
Eragon stared at him unhappily. He wanted Murtagh to stay. They had become friends during their
travels, and he was loath to tear that apart. He started to protest, but Saphira hushed him and said gently,
Wait until tomorrow. Now is not the time.
Very well,he said glumly. They talked until the stars were bright in the sky, then slept as Saphira took the
first watch.
Eragon woke two hours before dawn, his palm tingling. Everything was still and quiet, but something
sought his attention, like an itch in his mind. He buckled on Zar’roc and stood, careful not to make a
sound. Saphira looked at him curiously, her large eyes bright.What is it? she asked.
I don’t know,said Eragon. He saw nothing amiss.

Saphira sniffed the air curiously. She hissed a little and lifted her head. I smell horses nearby, but they’re
not moving. They reek with an unfamiliar stench.
Eragon crept to Murtagh and shook his shoulder. Murtagh woke with a start, yanked a dagger from
under his blankets, then looked at Eragon quizzically. Eragon motioned for him to be silent, whispering,
“There are horses close by.”
Murtagh wordlessly drew his sword. They quietly stationed themselves on either side of Saphira,
prepared for an attack. As they waited, the morning star rose in the east. A squirrel chattered.
Then an angry snarl from behind made Eragon spin around, sword held high. A broad Urgal stood at the
edge of the camp, carrying a mattock with a nasty spike.Where did he come from? We haven’t seen
their tracks anywhere! thought Eragon. The Urgal roared and waved his weapon, but did not charge.
“Brisingr!” barked Eragon, stabbing out with magic. The Urgal’s face contorted with terror as he
exploded in a flash of blue light. Blood splattered Eragon, and a brown mass flew through the air. Behind
him, Saphira bugled with alarm and reared. Eragon twisted around. While he had been occupied with the
first Urgal, a group of them had run up from the side.Of all the stupid tricks to fall for!
Steel clashed loudly as Murtagh attacked the Urgals. Eragon tried to join him but was blocked by four
of the monsters. The first one swung a sword at his shoulder. He ducked the blow and killed the Urgal
with magic. He caught a second one in the throat with Zar’roc, wheeled wildly, and slashed a third
through the heart. As he did, the fourth Urgal rushed at him, swinging a heavy club.
Eragon saw him coming and tried to lift his sword to block the club, but was a second too slow. As the
club came down on his head, he screamed, “Fly, Saphira!” A burst of light filled his eyes and he lost
consciousness.
DUSÚNDAVARFREOHR
The first things Eragon noticed were that he was warm and dry, his cheek was pressed against rough
fabric, and his hands were unbound. He stirred, but it was minutes before he was able to push himself
upright and examine his surroundings.
He was sitting in a cell on a narrow, bumpy cot. A barred window was set high in the wall. The
iron-bound door with a small window in its top half, barred like the one in the wall, was shut securely.
Dried blood cracked on Eragon’s face when he moved. It took him a moment to remember that it was
not his. His head hurt horribly—which was to be expected, considering the blow he had taken—and his
mind was strangely fuzzy. He tried to use magic, but could not concentrate well enough to remember any
of the ancient words.They must have drugged me, he finally decided.
With a groan he got up, missing the familiar weight of Zar’roc on his hip, and lurched to the window in
the wall. He managed to see out of it by standing on his toes. It took a minute for his eyes to adjust to the
bright light outside. The window was level with the ground. A street full of busy people ran past the side
of his cell, beyond which were rows of identical log houses.
Feeling weak, Eragon slid to the floor and stared at it blankly. What he had seen outside disturbed him,
but he was unsure why. Cursing his sluggish thinking, he leaned back his head and tried to clear his mind.
A man entered the room and set a tray of food and a pitcher of water on the cot.Wasn’t that nice of him?

thought Eragon, smiling pleasantly. He took a couple of bites of the thin cabbage soup and stale bread,
but was barely able to stomach it.I wish he had brought me something better, he complained, dropping
the spoon.
He suddenly realized what was wrong.I was captured by Urgals, not men! How did I end up here? His
befuddled brain grappled with the paradox unsuccessfully. With a mental shrug he filed the discovery
away for a time when he would know what to do with it.
He sat on the cot and gazed into the distance. Hours later more food was brought in.And I was just
getting hungry, he thought thickly. This time he was able to eat without feeling sick. When he finished, he
decided it was time for a nap. After all, he was on a bed; what else was he going to do?
His mind drifted off; sleep began to envelop him. Then a gate clanged open somewhere, and the din of
steel-shod boots marching on a stone floor filled the air. The noise grew louder and louder until it
sounded like someone banging a pot inside Eragon’s head. He grumbled to himself.Can’t they let me rest
in peace? Fuzzy curiosity slowly overcame his exhaustion, so he dragged himself to the door, blinking like
an owl.
Through the window he saw a wide hallway nearly ten yards across. The opposing wall was lined with
cells similar to his own. A column of soldiers marched through the hall, their swords drawn and ready.
Every man was dressed in matching armor; their faces bore the same hard expression, and their feet
came down on the floor with mechanical precision, never missing a beat. The sound was hypnotic. It was
an impressive display of force.
Eragon watched the soldiers until he grew bored. Just then he noticed a break in the middle of the
column. Carried between two burly men was an unconscious woman.
Her long midnight-black hair obscured her face, despite a leather strip bound around her head to hold
the tresses back. She was dressed in dark leather pants and shirt. Wrapped around her slim waist was a
shiny belt, from which hung an empty sheath on her right hip. Knee-high boots covered her calves and
small feet.
Her head lolled to the side. Eragon gasped, feeling like he had been struck in the stomach. She was the
woman from his dreams. Her sculpted face was as perfect as a painting. Her round chin, high
cheekbones, and long eyelashes gave her an exotic look. The only mar in her beauty was a scrape along
her jaw; nevertheless, she was the fairest woman he had ever seen.
Eragon’s blood burned as he looked at her. Something awoke in him—something he had never felt
before. It was like an obsession, except stronger, almost a fevered madness. Then the woman’s hair
shifted, revealing pointed ears. A chill crept over him. She was an elf.
The soldiers continued marching, taking her from his sight. Next strode a tall, proud man, a sable cape
billowing behind him. His face was deathly white; his hair was red. Red like blood.
As he walked by Eragon’s cell, the man turned his head and looked squarely at him with maroon eyes.
His upper lip pulled back in a feral smile, revealing teeth filed to points. Eragon shrank back. He knew
what the man was.A Shade. So help me… a Shade. The procession continued, and the Shade vanished
from view.
Eragon sank to the floor, hugging himself. Even in his bewildered state, he knew that the presence of a
Shade meant that evil was loose in the land. Whenever they appeared, rivers of blood were sure to

Page 177

follow.What is a Shade doing here? The soldiers should have killed him on sight! Then his thoughts
returned to the elf-woman, and he was grasped by strange emotions again.
I have to escape.But with his mind clouded, his determination quickly faded. He returned to the cot. By
the time the hallway fell silent, he was fast asleep.

As soon as Eragon opened his eyes, he knew something was different. It was easier for him to think; he
realized that he was in Gil’ead.They made a mistake; the drug’s wearing off! Hopeful, he tried to contact
Saphira and use magic, but both activities were still beyond his reach. A pit of worry twisted inside him
as he wondered if she and Murtagh had managed to escape. He stretched his arms and looked out the
window. The city was just awakening; the street was empty except for two beggars.
He reached for the water pitcher, ruminating about the elf and Shade. As he started to drink, he noticed
that the water had a faint odor, as if it contained a few drops of rancid perfume. Grimacing, he set the
pitcher down.The drug must be in there and maybe in the food as well! He remembered that when the
Ra’zac had drugged him, it had taken hours to wear off.If I can keep from drinking and eating for long
enough, I should be able to use magic. Then I can rescue the elf… The thought made him smile. He sat in
a corner, dreaming about how it could be done.
The portly jailer entered the cell an hour later with a tray of food. Eragon waited until he departed, then
carried the tray to the window. The meal was composed only of bread, cheese, and an onion, but the
smell made his stomach grumble hungrily. Resigning himself to a miserable day, he shoved the food out
the window and onto the street, hoping that no one would notice.
Eragon devoted himself to overcoming the drug’s effects. He had difficulty concentrating for any length
of time, but as the day progressed, his mental acuity increased. He began to remember several of the
ancient words, though nothing happened when he uttered them. He wanted to scream with frustration.
When lunch was delivered, he pushed it out the window after his breakfast. His hunger was distracting,
but it was the lack of water that taxed him most. The back of his throat was parched. Thoughts of
drinking cool water tortured him as each breath dried his mouth and throat a bit more. Even so, he forced
himself to ignore the pitcher.
He was diverted from his discomfort by a commotion in the hall. A man argued in a loud voice, “You
can’t go in there! The orders were clear: no one is to see him!”
“Really? Will you be the one to die stopping me, Captain?” cut in a smooth voice.
There was a subdued, “No… but the king—”
“Iwill handle the king,” interrupted the second person. “Now, unlock the door.”
After a pause, keys jangled outside Eragon’s cell. He tried to adopt a languorous expression.I have to
act like I don’t understand what’s going on. I can’t show surprise, no matter what this person says.
The door opened. His breath caught as he looked into the Shade’s face. It was like gazing at a death
mask or a polished skull with skin pulled over it to give the appearance of life. “Greetings,” said the
Shade with a cold smile, showing his filed teeth. “I’ve waited a long time to meet you.”

Page 178

“Who—who’re you?” asked Eragon, slurring his words.
“No one of consequence,” answered the Shade, his maroon eyes alight with controlled menace. He sat
with a flourish of his cloak. “My name does not matter to one in your position. It wouldn’t mean a thing
to you anyway. It’s you that I’m interested in. Who are you?”
The question was posed innocently enough, but Eragon knew there had to be a catch or trap in it,
though it eluded him. He pretended to struggle over the question for a while, then slowly said, frowning,
“I’m not sure… M’name’s Eragon, but that’s not all I am, is it?”
The Shade’s narrow lips stretched tautly over his mouth as he laughed sharply. “No, it isn’t. You have
an interesting mind, my young Rider.” He leaned forward. The skin on his forehead was thin and
translucent. “It seems I must be more direct. What is your name?”
“Era—”
“No! Not that one.” The Shade cut him off with a wave of his hand. “Don’t you have another one, one
that you use only rarely?”
He wants my true name so he can control me!realized Eragon.But I can’t tell him. I don’t even know it
myself. He thought quickly, trying to invent a deception that would conceal his ignorance.What if I made
up a name? He hesitated—it could easily give him away—then raced to create a name that would
withstand scrutiny. As he was about to utter it, he decided to take a chance and try to scare the Shade.
He deftly switched a few letters, then nodded foolishly and said, “Brom told it to me once. It was…” The
pause stretched for a few seconds, then his face brightened as he appeared to remember. “It was Du
Súndavar Freohr.” Which meant almost literally “death of the shadows.”
A grim chill settled over the cell as the Shade sat motionless, eyes veiled. He seemed to be deep in
thought, pondering what he had learned. Eragon wondered if he had dared too much. He waited until the
Shade stirred before asking ingenuously, “Why are you here?”
The Shade looked at him with contempt in his red eyes and smiled. “To gloat, of course. What use is a
victory if one cannot enjoy it?” There was confidence in his voice, but he seemed uneasy, as if his plans
had been disrupted. He stood suddenly. “I must attend to certain matters, but while I am gone you would
do well to think on who you would rather serve: a Rider who betrayed your own order or a fellow man
like me, though one skilled in arcane arts. When the time comes to choose, there will be no middle
ground.” He turned to leave, then glanced at Eragon’s water pitcher and stopped, his face granite hard.
“Captain!” he snapped.
A broad-shouldered man rushed into the cell, sword in hand. “What is it, my lord?” he asked, alarmed.
“Put that toy away,” instructed the Shade. He turned to Eragon and said in a deadly quiet voice, “The
boy hasn’t been drinking his water. Why is that?”
“I talked with the jailer earlier. Every bowl and plate was scraped clean.”
“Very well,” said the Shade, mollified. “But make sure that he starts drinking again.” He leaned toward
the captain and murmured into his ear. Eragon caught the last few words, “ …extra dose, just in case.”
The captain nodded. The Shade returned his attention to Eragon. “We will talk again tomorrow when I
am not so pressed for time. You should know, I have an endless fascination for names. I will greatly
enjoy discussing yours inmuch greater detail.”

The way he said it gave Eragon a sinking feeling.
Once they left, he lay on the cot and closed his eyes. Brom’s lessons proved their worth now; he relied
on them to keep himself from panicking and to reassure himself.Everything has been provided for me; I
only have to take advantage of it. His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of approaching soldiers.
Apprehensive, he went to the door and saw two soldiers dragging the elf down the hallway. When he
could see her no more, Eragon slumped to the floor and tried to touch the magic again. Oaths flew from
his lips when it eluded his grasp.
He looked out at the city and ground his teeth. It was only midafternoon. Taking a calming breath, he
tried to wait patiently.
FIGHTINGSHADOWS
It was dark in Eragon’s cell when he sat up with a start, electrified. The wrinkle had shifted! He had felt
the magic at the edge of his consciousness for hours, but every time he tried to use it, nothing happened.
Eyes bright with nervous energy, he clenched his hands and said, “Nagz reisa!” With a flap, the cot’s
blanket flew into the air and crumpled into a ball the size of his fist. It landed on the floor with a soft
thump.
Exhilarated, Eragon stood. He was weak from his enforced fast, but his excitement overcame his hunger.
Now for the real test. He reached out with his mind and felt the lock on the door. Instead of trying to
break or cut it, he simply pushed its internal mechanism into the unlocked position. With a click, the door
creaked inward.
When he had first used magic to kill the Urgals in Yazuac, it had consumed nearly all of his strength, but
he had grown much stronger since then. What once would have exhausted him now only tired him
slightly.
He cautiously stepped into the hall.I have to find Zar’roc and the elf. She must be in one of these cells,
but there isn’t time to look in them all. As for Zar’roc, the Shade might have it with him. He realized that
his thinking was still muddled.Why am I out here? I could escape right now if I went back into the cell
and opened the window with magic. But then I wouldn’t be able to rescue the elf… Saphira, where are
you? I need your help. He silently berated himself for not contacting her sooner. That should have been
the first thing he did after getting his power back.
Her reply came with surprising alacrity.Eragon! I’m over Gil’ead. Don’t do anything. Murtagh is on the
way.
What are—Footsteps interrupted him. He spun around, crouching as a squad of six soldiers marched
into the hall. They halted abruptly, eyes flicking between Eragon and the open cell door. Blood drained
from their faces.Good, they know who I am. Maybe I can scare them off so we won’t have to fight.
“Charge!” yelled one of the soldiers, running forward. The rest of the men drew their blades and
pounded down the hall.
It was madness to fight six men when he was unarmed and weak, but the thought of the elf kept him in
place. He could not force himself to abandon her. Uncertain if the effort would leave him standing, he
pulled on his power and raised his hand, the gedwëy ignasia glowing. Fear showed in the soldiers’ eyes,

Page 180

but they were hardened warriors and did not slow. As Eragon opened his mouth to pronounce the fatal
words, there was a low buzz, a flicker of motion. One of the men crashed to the floor with an arrow in
his back. Two more were struck before anyone understood what was happening.
At the end of the hall, where the soldiers had entered, stood a ragged, bearded man with a bow. A
crutch lay on the floor by his feet, apparently unneeded, for he stood tall and straight.
The three remaining soldiers turned to face this new threat. Eragon took advantage of the confusion.
“Thrysta!” he shouted. One of the men clutched his chest and fell. Eragon staggered as the magic took its
toll. Another soldier fell, pierced through the neck with an arrow. “Don’t kill him!” called Eragon, seeing
his rescuer take aim at the last soldier. The bearded man lowered his bow.
Eragon concentrated on the soldier before him. The man was breathing hard; the whites of his eyes
showed. He seemed to understand that his life was being spared.
“You’ve seen what I can do,” said Eragon harshly. “If you don’t answer my questions, the rest of your
life will be spent in utter misery and torment. Now where’s my sword—its sheath and blade are
red—and what cell is the elf in?”
The man clamped his mouth shut.
Eragon’s palm glowed ominously as he reached for the magic. “That was the wrong answer,” he
snapped. “Do you know how much pain a grain of sand can cause you when it’s embedded red hot in
your stomach? Especially when it doesn’t cool off for the next twenty years and slowly burns its way
down to your toes! By the time it gets out of you, you’ll be an old man.” He paused for effect. “Unless
you tell me what I want.”
The soldier’s eyes bulged, but he remained silent. Eragon scraped some dirt off the stone floor and
observed dispassionately, “This is a bit more than a piece of sand, but be comforted; it’ll burn through
you faster. Still, it’ll leave a bigger hole.” At his word, the dirt shone cherry red, though it did not burn his
hand.
“All right, just don’t put that in me!” yelped the soldier. “The elf’s in the last cell to the left! I don’t know
about your sword, but it’s probably in the guardroom upstairs. All the weapons are there.”
Eragon nodded, then murmured, “Slytha.” The soldier’s eyes rolled up in his head, and he collapsed
limply.
“Did you kill him?”
Eragon looked at the stranger, who was now only a few paces away. He narrowed his eyes, trying to
see past the beard. “Murtagh! Is that you?” he exclaimed.
“Yes,” said Murtagh, briefly lifting the beard from his shaven face. “I don’t want my face seen. Did you
kill him?”
“No, he’s only asleep. How did you get in?”
“There’s no time to explain. We have to get up to the next floor before anyone finds us. There’ll be an
escape route for us in a few minutes. We don’t want to miss it.”

Page 181

“Didn’t you hear what I said?” asked Eragon, gesturing at the unconscious soldier. “There’s an elf in the
prison. I saw her! We have to rescue her. I need your help.”
“An elf…!” Murtagh hurried down the hall, growling, “This is a mistake. We should flee while we have
the chance.” He stopped before the cell the soldier had indicated and produced a ring of keys from under
his ragged cloak. “I took it from one of the guards,” he explained.
Eragon motioned for the keys. Murtagh shrugged and handed them to him. Eragon found the right one
and swung the door open. A single beam of moonlight slanted through the window, illuminating the elf’s
face with cool silver.
She faced him, tense and coiled, ready for whatever would happen next. She held her head high, with a
queen’s demeanor. Her eyes, dark green, almost black, and slightly angled like a cat’s, lifted to Eragon’s.
Chills shot through him.
Their gaze held for a moment, then the elf trembled and collapsed soundlessly. Eragon barely caught her
before she struck the floor. She was surprisingly light. The aroma of freshly crushed pine needles
surrounded her.
Murtagh entered the cell. “She’s beautiful!”
“But hurt.”
“We can tend to her later. Are you strong enough to carry her?” Eragon shook his head. “Then I’ll do
it,” said Murtagh as he slung the elf across his shoulders. “Now, upstairs!” He handed Eragon a dagger,
then hurried back into the hall littered with soldiers’ bodies.
With heavy footsteps Murtagh led Eragon to a stone-hewn staircase at the end of the hall. As they
climbed it, Eragon asked, “How are we going to get out without being noticed?”
“We’re not,” grunted Murtagh.
That did not allay Eragon’s fears. He listened anxiously for soldiers or anyone else who might be nearby,
dreading what might happen if they met the Shade. At the head of the stairs was a banquet room filled
with broad wooden tables. Shields lined the walls, and the wood ceiling was trussed with curved beams.
Murtagh laid the elf on a table and looked at the ceiling worriedly. “Can you talk to Saphira for me?”
“Yes.”
“Tell her to wait another five minutes.”
There were shouts in the distance. Soldiers marched past the entrance to the banquet room. Eragon’s
mouth tightened with pent-up tension. “Whatever you’re planning to do, I don’t think we have much
time.”
“Just tell her, and stay out of sight,” snapped Murtagh, running off.
As Eragon relayed the message, he was alarmed to hear men coming up the stairs. Fighting hunger and
exhaustion, he dragged the elf off the table and hid her underneath it. He crouched next to her, holding his
breath, tightly clenching the dagger.

Page 182

Ten soldiers entered the room. They swept through it hurriedly, looking under only a couple of tables,
and continued on their way. Eragon leaned against a table leg, sighing. The respite made him suddenly
aware of his burning stomach and parched throat. A tankard and a plate of half-eaten food on the other
side of the room caught his attention.
Eragon dashed from his hiding place, grabbed the food, then scurried back to the table. There was
amber beer in the tankard, which he drank in two great gulps. Relief seeped through him as the cool
liquid ran down his throat, soothing the irritated tissue. He suppressed a belch before ravenously tearing
into a hunk of bread.
Murtagh returned carrying Zar’roc, a strange bow, and an elegant sword without a sheath. Murtagh
gave Zar’roc to Eragon. “I found the other sword and bow in the guardroom. I’ve never seen weapons
like them before, so I assumed they were the elf’s.”
“Let’s find out,” said Eragon through a mouthful of bread. The sword—slim and light with a curved
crossguard, the ends of which narrowed into sharp points—fit the elf’s sheath perfectly. There was no
way to tell if the bow was hers, but it was shaped so gracefully he doubted it could be anyone else’s.
“What now?” he asked, cramming another bite of food into his mouth. “We can’t stay here forever.
Sooner or later the soldiers will find us.”
“Now,” said Murtagh, taking out his own bow and fitting an arrow to the string, “we wait. Like I said,
our escape has been arranged.”
“You don’t understand; there’s a Shade here! If he finds us, we’re doomed.”
“A Shade!” exclaimed Murtagh. “In that case, tell Saphira to come immediately. We were going to wait
until the watch changed, but delaying even that long is too dangerous now.” Eragon relayed the message
succinctly, refraining from distracting Saphira with questions. “You messed up my plans by escaping
yourself,” groused Murtagh, watching the room’s entrances for soldiers.
Eragon smiled. “In that case, perhaps I should have waited.Your timing was perfect, though. I wouldn’t
have been able to even crawl if I had been forced to fight all those soldiers with magic.”
“Glad to be of some use,” remarked Murtagh. He stiffened as they heard men running nearby. “Let’s
just hope the Shade doesn’t find us.”
A cold chuckle filled the banquet room. “I’m afraid it’s far too late for that.”
Murtagh and Eragon spun around. The Shade stood alone at the end of the room. In his hand was a pale
sword with a thin scratch on the blade. He unclasped the brooch that held his cape in place and let the
garment fall to the floor. His body was like a runner’s, thin and compact, but Eragon remembered
Brom’s warning and knew that the Shade’s appearance was deceiving; he was many times stronger than
a normal human.
“So, my youngRider, do you wish to test yourself against me?” sneered the Shade. “I shouldn’t have
trusted the captain when he said you ate all your food. I will not make that mistake again.”
“I’ll take care of him,” said Murtagh quietly, putting down his bow and drawing his sword.
“No,” said Eragon under his breath. “He wants me alive, not you. I can stall him for a short while, but
then you’d better have a way out for us.”

Page 183

“Fine, go,” said Murtagh. “You won’t have to hold him off for long.”
“I hope not,” said Eragon grimly. He drew Zar’roc and slowly advanced. The red blade glinted with light
from torches on the wall.
The Shade’s maroon eyes burned like coals. He laughed softly. “Do you really think to defeat me, Du
Súndavar Freohr? What a pitiful name. I would have expected something more subtle from you, but I
suppose that’s all you’re capable of.”
Eragon refused to let himself be goaded. He stared at the Shade’s face, waiting for a flicker of his eyes
or twitch of his lip, anything that would betray his next move.I can’t use magic for fear of provoking him
to do the same. He has to think that he can win without resorting to it—which he probably can.
Before either of them moved, the ceiling boomed and shook. Dust billowed from it and turned the air
gray while pieces of wood fell around them, shattering on the floor. From the roof came screams and the
sound of clashing metal. Afraid of being brained by the falling timber, Eragon flicked his eyes upward.
The Shade took advantage of his distraction and attacked.
Eragon barely managed to get Zar’roc up in time to block a slash at his ribs. Their blades met with a
clang that jarred his teeth and numbed his arm.Hellfire! He’s strong! He grasped Zar’roc with both hands
and swung with all of his might at the Shade’s head. The Shade blocked him with ease, whipping his
sword through the air faster than Eragon had thought possible.
Terrible screeches sounded above them, like iron spikes being drawn across rock. Three long cracks
split the ceiling. Shingles from the slate roof fell through the fissures. Eragon ignored them, even when one
smashed into the floor next to him. Though he had trained with a master of the blade, Brom, and with
Murtagh, who was also a deadly swordsman, he had never been this outclassed. The Shade wasplaying
with him.
Eragon retreated toward Murtagh, arms trembling as he parried the Shade’s blows. Each one seemed
more powerful than the last. Eragon was no longer strong enough to call upon magic for help even if he
had wanted to. Then, with a contemptuous flick of his wrist, the Shade knocked Zar’roc out of Eragon’s
hand. The force of the blow sent him to his knees, where he stayed, panting. The screeching was louder
than ever. Whatever was happening, it was getting closer.
The Shade stared down at him haughtily. “A powerful piece you may be in the game that is being played,
but I’m disappointed that this is your best. If the other Riders were this weak, they must have controlled
the Empire only through sheer numbers.”
Eragon looked up and shook his head. He had figured out Murtagh’s plan.Saphira, now would be a
good time. “No, you forget something.”
“And what might that be?” asked the Shade mockingly.
There was a thunderous reverberation as a chunk of the ceiling was torn away to reveal the night sky.
“The dragons!” roared Eragon over the noise, and threw himself out of the Shade’s reach. The Shade
snarled in rage, swinging his sword viciously. He missed and lunged. Surprise spread across his face as
one of Murtagh’s arrows sprouted from his shoulder.
The Shade laughed and snapped the arrow off with two fingers. “You’ll have to do better than that if you

Page 184

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

want to stop me.” The next arrow caught him between the eyes. The Shade howled with agony and
writhed, covering his face. His skin turned gray. Mist formed in the air around him, obscuring his figure.
There was a shattering cry; then the cloud vanished.
Where the Shade had been, nothing was left but his cape and a pile of clothes. “You killed him!”
exclaimed Eragon. He knew of only two heroes of legend who had survived slaying a Shade.
“I’m not so sure,” said Murtagh.
A man shouted, “That’s it. He failed. Go in and get them!” Soldiers with nets and spears poured into the
banquet room from both ends. Eragon and Murtagh backed up against the wall, dragging the elf with
them. The men formed a menacing half-circle around them. Then Saphira stuck her head through the hole
in the ceiling and roared. She gripped the edge of the opening with her powerful talons and ripped off
another large section of the ceiling.
Three soldiers turned and ran, but the rest held their positions. With a resounding report, the center
beam of the ceiling cracked and rained down heavy shingles. Confusion scattered the ranks as they tried
to dodge the deadly barrage. Eragon and Murtagh pressed against the wall to avoid the falling debris.
Saphira roared again, and the soldiers fled, some getting crushed on the way.
With a final titanic effort, Saphira tore off the rest of the ceiling before jumping into the banquet hall with
her wings folded. Her weight splintered a table with a sharp crunch. Crying out with relief, Eragon threw
his arms around her. She hummed contentedly.I’ve missed you, little one.
Same here. There’s someone else with us. Can you carry three?
Of course,she said, kicking shingles and tables out of the way so she could take off. Murtagh and
Eragon pulled the elf out of hiding. Saphira hissed in surprise as she saw her.An elf!
Yes, and the woman I saw in my dreams,said Eragon, picking up Zar’roc. He helped Murtagh secure
the elf into the saddle, then they both climbed onto Saphira.I heard fighting on the roof. Are there men up
there?
There were, but no more. Are you ready?
Yes.
Saphira leapt out of the banquet hall and onto the fortress’s roof, where the bodies of watchmen lay
scattered. “Look!” said Murtagh, pointing. A row of archers filed out of a tower on the other side of the
roofless hall.
“Saphira, you have to take off. Now!” warned Eragon.
She unfurled her wings, ran toward the edge of the building, and propelled them over it with her
powerful legs. The extra weight on her back made her drop alarmingly. As she struggled to gain altitude,
Eragon heard the musical twang of bowstrings being released.
Arrows whizzed toward them in the dark. Saphira roared with pain as she was struck and quickly rolled
to the left to avoid the next volley. More arrows perforated the sky, but the night protected them from the
shafts’ deadly bite. Distressed, Eragon bent over Saphira’s neck.Where are you hurt?

My wings are pierced… one of the arrows didn’t go all the way through. It’s still there.Her breathing
was labored and heavy.
How far can you take us?
Far enough.Eragon clutched the elf tightly as they skimmed over Gil’ead, then left the city behind and
veered eastward, soaring upward through the night.
AWARRIOR AND AHEALER
Saphira drifted down to a clearing, landed on the crest of a hill, and rested her outstretched wings on the
ground. Eragon could feel her shaking beneath him. They were only a half-league from Gil’ead.
Picketed in the clearing were Snowfire and Tornac, who snorted nervously at Saphira’s arrival. Eragon
slid to the ground and immediately turned to Saphira’s injuries, while Murtagh readied the horses.
Unable to see well in the darkness, Eragon ran his hands blindly over Saphira’s wings. He found three
places where arrows had punctured the thin membrane, leaving bloody holes as thick around as his
thumb. A small piece had also been torn out of the back edge of her left wing. She shivered when his
fingers brushed the injuries. He tiredly healed the wounds with words from the ancient language. Then he
went to the arrow that was embedded in one of the large muscles of her flying arm. The arrowhead
poked through its underside. Warm blood dripped off it.
Eragon called Murtagh over and instructed, “Hold her wing down. I have to remove this arrow.” He
indicated where Murtagh should grip.This will be painful, he warned Saphira,but it’ll be over quickly. Try
not to struggle—you’ll hurt us.
She extended her neck and grabbed a tall sapling between her curved teeth. With a yank of her head,
she pulled the tree out of the ground and clamped it firmly in her jaws.I’m ready.
Okay,said Eragon. “Hold on,” he whispered to Murtagh, then broke off the head of the arrow. Trying
not cause any more damage, he swiftly pulled the shaft out of Saphira. As it left her muscle, she threw
back her head and whimpered past the tree in her mouth. Her wing jerked involuntarily, clipping Murtagh
under the chin and knocking him to the ground.
With a growl, Saphira shook the tree, spraying them with dirt before tossing it away. After Eragon
sealed the wound, he helped Murtagh up. “She caught me by surprise,” admitted Murtagh, touching his
scraped jaw.
I’m sorry.
“She didn’t mean to hit you,” assured Eragon. He checked on the unconscious elf.You’re going to have
to carry her a bit longer, he told Saphira.We can’t take her on the horses and ride fast enough. Flying
should be easier for you now that the arrow is out.
Saphira dipped her head.I will do it.
Thank you,said Eragon. He hugged her fiercely.What you did was incredible; I’ll never forget it.
Her eyes softened.I will go now. He backed away as she flew up in a flurry of air, the elf’s hair
streaming back. Seconds later they were gone. Eragon hurried to Snowfire, pulled himself into the

saddle, and galloped away with Murtagh.
While they rode, Eragon tried to remember what he knew about elves. They had long lives—that fact
was oft repeated—although he knew not how long. They spoke the ancient language, and many could
use magic. After the Riders’ fall, elves had retreated into seclusion. None of them had been seen in the
Empire since.So why is one here now? And how did the Empire manage to capture her? If she can use
magic, she’s probably drugged as I was.
They traveled through the night, not stopping even when their flagging strength began to slow them. They
continued onward despite burning eyes and clumsy movements. Behind them, lines of torch-bearing
horsemen searched around Gil’ead for their trail.
After many bleary hours, dawn lightened the sky. By unspoken consent Eragon and Murtagh stopped
the horses. “We have to make camp,” said Eragon wearily. “I must sleep—whether they catch us or
not.”
“Agreed,” said Murtagh, rubbing his eyes. “Have Saphira land. We’ll meet her.”
They followed Saphira’s directions and found her drinking from a stream at the base of a small cliff, the
elf still slouched on her back. Saphira greeted them with a soft bugle as Eragon dismounted.
Murtagh helped him remove the elf from Saphira’s saddle and lower her to the ground. Then they
sagged against the rock face, exhausted. Saphira examined the elf curiously.I wonder why she hasn’t
woken. It’s been hours since we left Gil’ead.
Who knows what they did to her?said Eragon grimly.
Murtagh followed their gaze. “As far as I know, she’s the first elf the king has captured. Ever since they
went into hiding, he’s been looking for them without success—until now. So he’s either found their
sanctuary, or she was captured by chance. I think it was chance. If he had found the elf haven, he would
have declared war and sent his army after the elves. Since that hasn’t happened, the question is, Were
Galbatorix’s men able to extract the elves’ location before we rescued her?”
“We won’t know until she regains consciousness. Tell me what happened after I was captured. How did
I end up in Gil’ead?”
“The Urgals are working for the Empire,” said Murtagh shortly, pushing back his hair. “And, it seems,
the Shade as well. Saphira and I saw the Urgals give you to him—though I didn’t know who it was at the
time—and a group of soldiers. They were the ones who took you to Gil’ead.”
It’s true,said Saphira, curling up next to them.
Eragon’s mind flashed back to the Urgals he had spoken with at Teirm and the “master” they had
mentioned.They meant the king! I insulted the most powerful man in Alagaësia! he realized with dread.
Then he remembered the horror of the slaughtered villagers in Yazuac. A sick, angry feeling welled in his
stomach.The Urgals were under Galbatorix’s orders! Why would he commit such an atrocity on his own
subjects?
Because he is evil,stated Saphira flatly.
Glowering, Eragon exclaimed, “This will mean war! Once the people of the Empire learn of it, they will

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

rebel and support the Varden.”
Murtagh rested his chin in his hand. “Even if they heard of this outrage, few would make it to the
Varden. With the Urgals under his command, the king has enough warriors to close the Empire’s borders
and remain in control, no matter how disruptive people are. With such a rule of terror, he will be able to
shape the Empire however he wants. And though he is hated, people could be galvanized into joining him
if they had a common enemy.”
“Who would that be?” asked Eragon, confused.
“The elves and the Varden. With the right rumors they can be portrayed as the most despicable
monsters in Alagaësia—fiends who are waiting to seize your land and wealth. The Empire could even say
that the Urgals have been misunderstood all this time and that they are really friends and allies against
such terrible enemies. I only wonder what the king promised them in return for their services.”
“It wouldn’t work,” said Eragon, shaking his head. “No one could be deceived that easily about
Galbatorix and the Urgals. Besides, why would he want to do that? He’s already in power.”
“But his authority is challenged by the Varden, with whom people sympathize. There’s also Surda, which
has defied him since it seceded from the Empire. Galbatorix is strong within the Empire, but his arm is
weak outside of it. As for people seeing through his deceptions, they’ll believe whatever he wants them
to. It’s happened before.” Murtagh fell silent and gazed moodily into the distance.
His words troubled Eragon. Saphira touched him with her mind:Where is Galbatorix sending the Urgals?
What?
In both Carvahall and Teirm, you heard that Urgals were leaving the area and migrating southeast, as if
to brave the Hadarac Desert. If the king truly does control them, why is he sending them in that direction?
Maybe an Urgal army is being gathered for his private use or an Urgal city is being formed.
Eragon shuddered at the thought.I’m too tired to figure it out. Whatever Galbatorix’s plans, they’ll only
cause us trouble. I just wish that we knew where the Varden are. That’s where we should be going, but
we’re lost without Dormnad. It doesn’t matter what we do; the Empire will find us.
Don’t give up,she said encouragingly, then added dryly,though you’re probably right.
Thanks.He looked at Murtagh. “You risked your life to rescue me; I owe you for that. I couldn’t have
escaped on my own.” It was more than that, though. There was a bond between them now, welded in
the brotherhood of battle and tempered by the loyalty Murtagh had shown.
“I’m just glad I could help. It…” Murtagh faltered and rubbed his face. “My main worry now is how
we’re going to travel with so many men searching for us. Gil’ead’s soldiers will be hunting us tomorrow;
once they find the horses’ tracks, they’ll know you didn’t fly away with Saphira.”
Eragon glumly agreed. “How did you manage to get into the castle?”
Murtagh laughed softly. “By paying a steep bribe and crawling through a filthy scullery chute. But the
plan wouldn’t have worked without Saphira. She,” he stopped and directed his words at her, “that is,
you, are the only reason we escaped alive.”

Page 188

Eragon solemnly put a hand on her scaly neck. As she hummed contentedly, he gazed at the elf’s face,
captivated. Reluctantly, he dragged himself upright. “We should make a bed for her.”
Murtagh got to his feet and stretched out a blanket for the elf. When they lifted her onto it, the cuff of her
sleeve tore on a branch. Eragon began to pinch the fabric together, then gasped.
The elf’s arm was mottled with a layer of bruises and cuts; some were half healed, while others were
fresh and oozing. Eragon shook his head with anger and pulled the sleeve up higher. The injuries
continued to her shoulder. With trembling fingers, he unlaced the back of her shirt, dreading what might
be under it.
As the leather slipped off, Murtagh cursed. The elf’s back was strong and muscled, but it was covered
with scabs that made her skin look like dry, cracked mud. She had been whipped mercilessly and
branded with hot irons in the shape of claws. Where her skin was still intact, it was purple and black from
numerous beatings. On her left shoulder was a tattoo inscribed with indigo ink. It was the same symbol
that had been on the sapphire of Brom’s ring. Eragon silently swore an oath that he would kill whoever
was responsible for torturing the elf.
“Can you heal this?” asked Murtagh.
“I—I don’t know,” said Eragon. He swallowed back sudden queasiness. “There’s so much.”
Eragon!said Saphira sharply.This is an elf. She cannot be allowed to die. Tired or not, hungry or not,
you must save her. I will meld my strength with yours, but you are the one who must wield the magic.
Yes… you are right,he murmured, unable to tear his eyes from the elf. Determined, he pulled off his
gloves and said to Murtagh, “This is going to take some time. Can you get me food? Also, boil rags for
bandages; I can’t heal all her wounds.”
“We can’t make a fire without being seen,” objected Murtagh. “You’ll have to use unwashed cloths, and
the food will be cold.” Eragon grimaced but acquiesced. As he gently laid a hand on the elf’s spine,
Saphira settled next to him, her glittering eyes fixed on the elf. He took a deep breath, then reached for
the magic and started working.
He spoke the ancient words, “Waíse heill!” A burn shimmered under his palm, and new, unmarked skin
flowed over it, joining together without a scar. He passed over bruises or other wounds that were not
life-threatening—healing them all would consume the energy he needed for more serious injuries. As
Eragon toiled, he marveled that the elf was still alive. She had been repeatedly tortured to the edge of
death with a precision that chilled him.
Although he tried to preserve the elf’s modesty, he could not help but notice that underneath the
disfiguring marks, her body was exceptionally beautiful. He was exhausted and did not dwell upon
it—though his ears turned red at times, and he fervently hoped that Saphira did not know what he was
thinking.
He labored through dawn, pausing only at brief intervals to eat and drink, trying to replenish himself from
his fast, the escape, and now healing the elf. Saphira remained by his side, lending her strength where she
could. The sun was well into the sky when he finally stood, groaning as his cramped muscles stretched.
His hands were gray and his eyes felt dry and gritty. He stumbled to the saddlebags and took a long
drink from the wineskin. “Is it done?” asked Murtagh.

Page 189

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Eragon nodded, trembling. He did not trust himself to speak. The camp spun before him; he nearly
fainted.You did well, said Saphira soothingly.
“Will she live?”
“I don’t—don’t know,” he said in a ravaged voice. “Elves are strong, but even they cannot endure
abuse like this with impunity. If I knew more about healing, I might be able to revive her, but…” He
gestured helplessly. His hand was shaking so badly he spilled some of the wine. Another swig helped to
steady him. “We’d better start riding again.”
“No! You must sleep,” protested Murtagh.
“I… can sleep in the saddle. But we can’t afford to stay here, not with the soldiers closing on us.”
Murtagh reluctantly gave in. “In that case I’ll lead Snowfire while you rest.” They resaddled the horses,
strapped the elf onto Saphira, and departed the camp. Eragon ate while he rode, trying to replace his
depleted energy before he leaned forward against Snowfire and closed his eyes.
WATER FROMSAND
When they stopped for the evening, Eragon felt no better and his temper had worsened. Most of the day
had been spent on long detours to avoid detection by soldiers with hunting dogs. He dismounted
Snowfire and asked Saphira,How is she?
I think no worse than before. She stirred slightly a few times, but that was all.Saphira crouched low to
the ground to let him lift the elf out of the saddle. For a moment her soft form pressed against Eragon.
Then he hurriedly put her down.
He and Murtagh made a small dinner. It was difficult for them to fight off the urge to sleep. When they
had eaten, Murtagh said, “We can’t keep up this pace; we aren’t gaining any ground on the soldiers.
Another day or two of this and they’ll be sure to overtake us.”
“What else can we do?” snapped Eragon. “If it were just the two of us and you were willing to leave
Tornac behind, Saphira could fly us out of here. But with the elf, too? Impossible.”
Murtagh looked at him carefully. “If you want to go your own way, I won’t stop you. I can’t expect you
and Saphira to stay and risk imprisonment.”
“Don’t insult me,” Eragon muttered. “The only reason I’m free is because of you. I’m not going to
abandon you to the Empire. Poor thanks that would be!”
Murtagh bowed his head. “Your words hearten me.” He paused. “But they don’t solve our problem.”
“What can?” Eragon asked. He gestured at the elf. “I wish she could tell us where the elves are; perhaps
we could seek sanctuary with them.”
“Considering how they’ve protected themselves, I doubt she’d reveal their location. Even if she did, the
others of her kind might not welcome us. Why would they want to shelter us anyway? The last Riders
they had contact with were Galbatorix and the Forsworn. I doubt that left them with pleasant memories.
And I don’t even have the dubious honor of being a Rider like you. No, they would not want me at all.”

Page 190

They would accept us,said Saphira confidently as she shifted her wings to a more comfortable position.
Eragon shrugged. “Even if they would protect us, we can’t find them, and it’s impossible to ask the elf
until she regains consciousness. We must flee, but in which direction—north, south, east, or west?”
Murtagh laced his fingers together and pressed his thumbs against his temples. “I think the only thing we
can do is leave the Empire. The few safe places within it are far from here. They would be difficult to
reach without being caught or followed… There’s nothing for us to the north except the forest Du
Weldenvarden—which we might be able to hide in, but I don’t relish going back past Gil’ead. Only the
Empire and the sea lie westward. To the south is Surda, where you might be able to find someone to
direct you to the Varden. As for going east…” He shrugged. “To the east, the Hadarac Desert stands
between us and whatever lands exist in that direction. The Varden are somewhere across it, but without
directions it might take us years to find them.”
We would be safe, though,remarked Saphira.As long as we didn’t encounter any Urgals.
Eragon knitted his brow. A headache threatened to drown his thoughts in hot throbs. “It’s too dangerous
to go to Surda. We would have to traverse most of the Empire, avoiding every town and village. There
are too many people between us and Surda to get there unnoticed.”
Murtagh raised an eyebrow. “So you want to go across the desert?”
“I don’t see any other options. Besides, that way we can leave the Empire before the Ra’zac get here.
With their flying steeds, they’ll probably arrive in Gil’ead in a couple of days, so we don’t have much
time.”
“Even if we do reach the desert before they get here,” said Murtagh, “they could still overtake us. It’ll be
hard to outdistance them at all.”
Eragon rubbed Saphira’s side, her scales rough under his fingers. “That’s assuming they can follow our
trail. To catch us, though, they’ll have to leave the soldiers behind, which is to our advantage. If it comes
to a fight, I think the three of us can defeat them… as long as we aren’t ambushed the way Brom and I
were.”
“If we reach the other side of the Hadarac safely,” said Murtagh slowly, “where will we go? Those lands
are well outside of the Empire. There will be few cities, if any. And then there is the desert itself. What do
you know of it?”
“Only that it’s hot, dry, and full of sand,” confessed Eragon.
“That about sums it up,” replied Murtagh. “It’s filled with poisonous and inedible plants, venomous
snakes, scorpions, and a blistering sun. You saw the great plain on our way to Gil’ead?”
It was a rhetorical question, but Eragon answered anyway, “Yes, and once before.”
“Then you are familiar with its immense range. It fills the heart of the Empire. Now imagine something
two or three times its size, and you’ll understand the vastness of the Hadarac Desert. That is what you’re
proposing to cross.”
Eragon tried to envision a piece of land that gigantic but was unable to grasp the distances involved. He
retrieved the map of Alagaësia from his saddlebags. The parchment smelled musty as he unrolled it on the

Page 191

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

ground. He inspected the plains and shook his head in amazement. “No wonder the Empire ends at the
desert. Everything on the other side is too far away for Galbatorix to control.”
Murtagh swept his hand over the right side of the parchment. “All the land beyond the desert, which is
blank on this map, was under one rule when the Riders lived. If the king were to raise up new Riders
under his command, it would allow him to expand the Empire to an unprecedented size. But that wasn’t
the point I was trying to make. The Hadarac Desert is so huge and contains so many dangers, the
chances are slim that we can cross it unscathed. It is a desperate path to take.”
“Wearedesperate,” said Eragon firmly. He studied the map carefully. “If we rode through the belly of the
desert, it would take well over a month, perhaps even two, to cross it. But if we angle southeast, toward
the Beor Mountains, we could cut through much faster. Then we can either follow the Beor Mountains
farther east into the wilderness or go west to Surda. If this map is accurate, the distance between here
and the Beors is roughly equal to what we covered on our way to Gil’ead.”
“But that took us nearly a month!”
Eragon shook his head impatiently. “Our ride to Gil’ead was slow on account of my injuries. If we press
ourselves, it’ll take only a fraction of that time to reach the Beor Mountains.”
“Enough. You made your point,” acknowledged Murtagh. “Before I consent, however, something must
be solved. As I’m sure you noticed, I bought supplies for us and the horses while I was in Gil’ead. But
how can we get enough water? The roving tribes who live in the Hadarac usually disguise their wells and
oases so no one can steal their water. And carrying enough for more than a day is impractical. Just think
about how much Saphira drinks! She and the horses consume more water at one time than we do in a
week. Unless you can make it rain whenever we need, I don’t see how we can go the direction you
propose.”
Eragon rocked back on his heels. Making rain was well beyond his power. He suspected that not even
the strongest Rider could have done it. Moving that much air was like trying to lift a mountain. He needed
a solution that would not drain all of his strength.I wonder if it’s possible to convert sand into water? That
would solve our problem, but only if it doesn’t take too much energy.
“I have an idea,” he said. “Let me experiment, then I’ll give you an answer.” Eragon strode out of the
camp, with Saphira following closely.
What are you going to try?she asked.
“I don’t know,” he muttered.Saphira, could you carry enough water for us?
She shook her enormous head.No, I wouldn’t even be able to lift that much weight, let alone fly with it.
Too bad.He knelt and picked up a stone with a cavity large enough for a mouthful of water. He pressed
a clump of dirt into the hollow and studied it thoughtfully. Now came the hard part. Somehow he had to
convert the dirt into water.But what words should I use? He puzzled over it for a moment, then picked
two he hoped would work. The icy magic rushed through him as he breached the familiar barrier in his
mind and commanded, “Deloi moi!”
Immediately the dirt began to absorb his strength at a prodigious rate. Eragon’s mind flashed back to
Brom’s warning that certain tasks could consume all of his power and take his life. Panic blossomed in
his chest. He tried to release the magic but could not. It was linked to him until the task was complete or

Page 192

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

he was dead. All he could do was remain motionless, growing weaker every moment.
Just as he became convinced that he would die kneeling there, the dirt shimmered and morphed into a
thimbleful of water. Relieved, Eragon sat back, breathing hard. His heart pounded painfully and hunger
gnawed at his innards.
What happened?asked Saphira.
Eragon shook his head, still in shock from the drain on his body’s reserves. He was glad that he had not
tried to transmute anything larger.This… this won’t work, he said.I don’t even have the strength to give
myself a drink.
You should have been more careful,she chided.Magic can yield unexpected results when the ancient
words are combined in new ways.
He glared at her.I know that, but this was the only way I could test my idea. I wasn’t going to wait until
we were in the desert! He reminded himself that she was only trying to help.How did you turn Brom’s
grave into diamond without killing yourself? I can barely handle a bit of dirt, much less all that sandstone.
I don’t know how I did it,she stated calmly.It just happened.
Could you do it again, but this time make water?
Eragon,she said, looking him squarely in the face.I’ve no more control over my abilities than a spider
does. Things like that occur whether I will them or not. Brom told you that unusual events happen around
dragons. He spoke truly. He gave no explanation for it, nor do I have one. Sometimes I can work
changes just by feel, almost without thought. The rest of the time—like right now—I’m as powerless as
Snowfire.
You’re never powerless,he said softly, putting a hand on her neck. For a long period they were both
quiet. Eragon remembered the grave he had made and how Brom lay within it. He could still see the
sandstone flowing over the old man’s face. “At least we gave him a decent burial,” he whispered.
He idly swirled a finger in the dirt, making twisting ridges. Two of the ridges formed a miniature valley,
so he added mountains around it. With his fingernail he scratched a river down the valley, then deepened
it because it seemed too shallow. He added a few more details until he found himself staring at a passable
reproduction of Palancar Valley. Homesickness welled up within him, and he obliterated the valley with a
swipe of his hand.
I don’t want to talk about it,he muttered angrily, staving off Saphira’s questions. He crossed his arms
and glared at the ground. Almost against his will, his eyes flicked back to where he had gouged the earth.
He straightened, surprised. Though the ground was dry, the furrow he had made was lined with moisture.
Curious, he scraped away more dirt and found a damp layer a few inches under the surface. “Look at
this!” he said excitedly.
Saphira lowered her nose to his discovery.How does this help us? Water in the desert is sure to be
buried so deeply we would have to dig for weeks to find it.
Yes,said Eragon delightedly,but as long as it’s there, I can get it. Watch!He deepened the hole, then
mentally accessed the magic. Instead of changing the dirt into water, he simply summoned forth the
moisture that was already in the earth. With a faint trickle, water rushed into the hole. He smiled and

Page 193

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

sipped from it. The liquid was cool and pure, perfect for drinking.See! We can get all we need.
Saphira sniffed the pool.Here, yes. But in the desert? There may not be enough water in the ground for
you to bring to the surface.
It will work,Eragon assured her.All I’m doing is lifting the water, an easy enough task. As long as it’s
done slowly, my strength will hold. Even if I have to draw the water from fifty paces down, it won’t be a
problem. Especially if you help me.
Saphira looked at him dubiously.Are you sure? Think carefully upon your answer, for it will mean our
lives if you are wrong.
Eragon hesitated, then said firmly,I’m sure.
Then go tell Murtagh. I will keep watch while you sleep.
But you’ve stayed up all night like us,he objected.You should rest.
I’ll be fine—I’m stronger than you know,she said gently. Her scales rustled as she curled up with a
watchful eye turned northward, toward their pursuers. Eragon hugged her, and she hummed deeply, sides
vibrating.Go.
He lingered, then reluctantly returned to Murtagh, who asked, “Well? Is the desert open to us?”
“It is,” acknowledged Eragon. He flopped onto his blankets and explained what he had learned. When
he finished, Eragon turned to the elf. Her face was the last thing he saw before falling asleep.
THERAMRRIVER
They forced themselves to rise early in the gray predawn hours. Eragon shivered in the cool air. “How
are we going to transport the elf? She can’t ride on Saphira’s back much longer without getting sores
from her scales. Saphira can’t carry her in her claws—it tires her and makes landing dangerous. A sledge
won’t work; it would get battered to pieces while we ride, and I don’t want the horses slowed by the
weight of another person.”
Murtagh considered the matter as he saddled Tornac. “If you were to ride Saphira, we could lash the elf
onto Snowfire, but we’d have the same problem with sores.”
I have a solution,said Saphira unexpectedly.Why don’t you tie the elf to my belly? I’ll still be able to
move freely, and she will be safer than anywhere else. The only danger will be if soldiers shoot arrows at
me, but I can easily fly above those.
None of them could come up with a better idea, so they quickly adopted hers. Eragon folded one of his
blankets in half lengthwise, secured it around the elf’s petite form, then took her to Saphira. Blankets and
spare clothes were sacrificed to form ropes long enough to encircle Saphira’s girth. With those ropes, the
elf was tied back-first against Saphira’s belly, her head between Saphira’s front legs. Eragon looked
critically at their handiwork. “I’m afraid your scales may rub through the ropes.”
“We’ll have to check them occasionally for fraying,” commented Murtagh.
Shall we go now?Saphira asked, and Eragon repeated the question.

Page 194

Murtagh’s eyes sparked dangerously, a tight smile lifting his lips. He glanced back the way they had
come, where smoke from soldiers’ camps was clearly visible, and said, “I always did like races.”
“And now we are in one for our lives!”
Murtagh swung into Tornac’s saddle and trotted out of the camp. Eragon followed close behind on
Snowfire. Saphira jumped into the air with the elf. She flew low to the ground to avoid being seen by the
soldiers. In this fashion, the three of them made their way southeast toward the distant Hadarac Desert.
Eragon kept a quick eye out for pursuers as he rode. His mind repeatedly wandered back to the elf.An
elf! He had actually seen one, and she was with them! He wondered what Roran would think of that. It
struck him that if he ever returned to Carvahall, he would have a hard time convincing anyone that his
adventures had actually occurred.

For the rest of the day, Eragon and Murtagh sped through the land, ignoring discomfort and fatigue.
They drove the horses as hard as they could without killing them. Sometimes they dismounted and ran on
foot to give Tornac and Snowfire a rest. Only twice did they stop—both times to let the horses eat and
drink.
Though the soldiers of Gil’ead were far behind now, Eragon and Murtagh found themselves having to
avoid new soldiers every time they passed a town or village. Somehow the alarm had been sent ahead of
them. Twice they were nearly ambushed along the trail, escaping only because Saphira happened to smell
the men ahead of them. After the second incident, they avoided the trail entirely.
Dusk softened the countryside as evening drew a black cloak across the sky. Through the night they
traveled, relentlessly pacing out the miles. In the deepest hours of night, the ground rose beneath them to
form low cactus-dotted hills.
Murtagh pointed forward. “There’s a town, Bullridge, some leagues ahead that we must bypass. They’re
sure to have soldiers watching for us. We should try to slip past them now while it’s dark.”
After three hours they saw the straw-yellow lanterns of Bullridge. A web of soldiers patrolled between
watch fires scattered around the town. Eragon and Murtagh muffled their sword sheaths and carefully
dismounted. They led the horses in a wide detour around Bullridge, listening attentively to avoid stumbling
on an encampment.
With the town behind them, Eragon relaxed slightly. Daybreak finally flooded the sky with a delicate
blush and warmed the chilly night air. They halted on the crest of a hill to observe their surroundings. The
Ramr River was to their left, but it was also five miles to their right. The river continued south for several
leagues, then doubled back on itself in a narrow loop before curving west. They had covered over
sixteen leagues in one day.
Eragon leaned against Snowfire’s neck, happy with the distance they had gone. “Let’s find a gully or
hollow where we can sleep undisturbed.” They stopped at a small stand of juniper trees and laid their
blankets beneath them. Saphira waited patiently as they untied the elf from her belly.
“I’ll take the first watch and wake you at midmorning,” said Murtagh, setting his bare sword across his
knees. Eragon mumbled his assent and pulled the blankets over his shoulders.

Nightfall found them worn and drowsy but determined to continue. As they prepared to leave, Saphira
observed to Eragon,This is the third night since we rescued you from Gil’ead, and the elf still hasn’t
woken. I’m worried. And,she continued,she has neither drunk nor eaten in that time. I know little of
elves, but she is slender, and I doubt she can survive much longer without nourishment.
“What’s wrong?” asked Murtagh over Tornac’s back.
“The elf,” said Eragon, looking down at her. “Saphira is troubled that she hasn’t woken or eaten; it
disturbs me too. I healed her wounds, at least on the surface, but it doesn’t seem to have done her any
good.”
“Maybe the Shade tampered with her mind,” suggested Murtagh.
“Then we have to help her.”
Murtagh knelt by the elf. He examined her intently, then shook his head and stood. “As far as I can tell,
she’s only sleeping. It seems as if I could wake her with a word or a touch, yet she slumbers on. Her
coma might be something elves self-induce to escape the pain of injury, but if so, why doesn’t she end it?
There’s no danger to her now.”
“But does she know that?” asked Eragon quietly.
Murtagh put a hand on his shoulder. “This must wait. We have to leave now or risk losing our hard-won
lead. You can tend to her later when we stop.”
“One thing first,” said Eragon. He soaked a rag, then squeezed the cloth so water dripped between the
elf’s sculpted lips. He did that several times and dabbed above her straight, angled eyebrows, feeling
oddly protective.

They headed through the hills, avoiding the tops for fear of being spotted by sentries. Saphira stayed
with them on the ground for the same reason. Despite her bulk, she was stealthy; only her tail could be
heard scraping over the ground, like a thick blue snake.
Eventually the sky brightened in the east. The morning star Aiedail appeared as they reached the edge of
a steep bank covered with mounds of brush. Water roared below as it tore over boulders and sluiced
through branches.
“The Ramr!” said Eragon over the noise.
Murtagh nodded. “Yes! We have to find a place to ford safely.”
That isn’t necessary,said Saphira.I can carry you across, no matter how wide the river is.
Eragon looked up at her blue-gray form.What about the horses? We can’t leave them behind. They’re
too heavy for you to lift.

Page 196

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

As long as you’re not on them and they don’t struggle too much, I’m sure that I can carry them. If I can
dodge arrows with three people on my back, I can certainly fly a horse in a straight line over a river.
I believe you, but let’s not attempt it unless we have to. It’s too dangerous.
She clambered down the embankment.We can’t afford to squander time here.
Eragon followed her, leading Snowfire. The bank came to an abrupt end at the Ramr, where the river
ran dark and swift. White mist wafted up from the water, like blood steaming in winter. It was impossible
to see the far side. Murtagh tossed a branch into the torrent and watched it race away, bobbing on the
rough water.
“How deep do you think it is?” asked Eragon.
“I can’t tell,” said Murtagh, worry coloring his voice. “Can you see how far across it is with magic?”
“I don’t think so, not without lighting up this place like a beacon.”
With a gust of air, Saphira took off and soared over the Ramr. After a short time, she said,I’m on the
other bank. The river is over a half-mile wide. You couldn’t have chosen a worse place to cross; the
Ramr bends at this point and is at its widest.
“A half-mile!” exclaimed Eragon. He told Murtagh about Saphira’s offer to fly them.
“I’d rather not try it, for the horses’ sake. Tornac isn’t as accustomed to Saphira as Snowfire. He might
panic and injure them both. Ask Saphira to look for shallows where we can swim over safely. If there
aren’t any within a mile in either direction, then I suppose she can ferry us.”
At Eragon’s request, Saphira agreed to search for a ford. While she explored, they hunkered next to the
horses and ate dry bread. It was not long before Saphira returned, her velvet wings whispering in the
early dawn sky.The water is both deep and strong, upstream as well as downstream.
Once he was told, Murtagh said, “I’d better go over first, so I can watch the horses.” He scrambled
onto Saphira’s saddle. “Be careful with Tornac. I’ve had him for many years. I don’t want anything to
happen to him.” Then Saphira took off.
When she returned, the unconscious elf had been untied from her belly. Eragon led Tornac to Saphira,
ignoring the horse’s low whinnies. Saphira reared back on her haunches to grasp the horse around the
belly with her forelegs. Eragon eyed her formidable claws and said, “Wait!” He repositioned Tornac’s
saddle blanket, strapping it to the horse’s belly so it protected his soft underside, then gestured for
Saphira to proceed.
Tornac snorted in fright and tried to bolt when Saphira’s forelegs clamped around his sides, but she held
him tightly. The horse rolled his eyes wildly, the whites rimming his dilated pupils. Eragon tried to gentle
Tornac with his mind, but the horse’s panic resisted his touch. Before Tornac could try to escape again,
Saphira jumped skyward, her hind legs thrusting with such force that her claws gouged the rocks
underneath. Her wings strained furiously, struggling to lift the enormous load. For a moment it seemed she
would fall back to the ground. Then, with a lunge, she shot into the air. Tornac screamed in terror,
kicking and tossing. It was a terrible sound, like screeching metal.
Eragon swore, wondering if anyone was close enough to hear.You’d better hurry, Saphira. He listened

Page 197

for soldiers as he waited, scanning the inky landscape for the telltale flash of torches. It soon met his eye
in a line of horsemen sliding down a bluff almost a league away.
As Saphira landed, Eragon brought Snowfire to her.Murtagh’s silly animal is in hysterics. He had to tie
Tornac down to prevent him from running away. She gripped Snowfire and carried him off, ignoring the
horse’s trumpeted protestations. Eragon watched her go, feeling lonely in the night. The horsemen were
only a mile away.
Finally Saphira came for him, and they were soon on firm ground once more, with the Ramr to their
backs. Once the horses were calmed and the saddles readjusted, they resumed their flight toward the
Beor Mountains. The air filled with the calls of birds waking to a new day.
Eragon dozed even when walking. He was barely aware that Murtagh was just as drowsy. There were
times when neither of them guided the horses, and it was only Saphira’s vigilance that kept them on
course.
Eventually the ground became soft and gave way under their feet, forcing them to halt. The sun was high
overhead. The Ramr River was no more than a fuzzy line behind them.
They had reached the Hadarac Desert.
THEHADARACDESERT
Avast expanse of dunes spread to the horizon like ripples on an ocean. Bursts of wind twirled the
reddish gold sand into the air. Scraggly trees grew on scattered patches of solid ground—ground any
farmer would have declared unfit for crops. Rising in the distance was a line of purple crags. The
imposing desolation was barren of any animals except for a bird gliding on the zephyrs.
“You’re sure we’ll find food for the horses out there?” queried Eragon, slurring his words. The hot, dry
air stung his throat.
“See those?” asked Murtagh, indicating the crags. “Grass grows around them. It’s short and tough, but
the horses will find it sufficient.”
“I hope you’re right,” said Eragon, squinting at the sun. “Before we continue, let’s rest. My mind is slow
as a snail, and I can barely move my legs.”
They untied the elf from Saphira, ate, then lay in the shadow of a dune for a nap. As Eragon settled into
the sand, Saphira coiled up next to him and spread her wings over them.This is a wondrous place, she
said.I could spend years here and not notice the passing time.
Eragon closed his eyes.It would be a nice place to fly, he agreed drowsily.
Not only that, I feel as though I was made for this desert. It has the space I need, mountains where I
could roost, and camouflaged prey that I could spend days hunting. And the warmth! Cold does not
disturb me, but this heat makes me feel alive and full of energy.She craned her head toward the sky,
stretching happily.
You like it that much?mumbled Eragon.
Yes.

Page 198

Then when this is all done, perhaps we can return…He drifted into slumber even as he spoke. Saphira
was pleased and hummed gently while he and Murtagh rested.
It was the morning of the fourth day since leaving Gil’ead. They had already covered thirty-five leagues.

They slept just long enough to clear their minds and rest the horses. No soldiers could be seen to the
rear, but that did not lull them into slowing their pace. They knew that the Empire would keep searching
until they were far beyond the king’s reach. Eragon said, “Couriers must have carried news of my escape
to Galbatorix. He would have alerted the Ra’zac. They’re sure to be on our trail by now. It’ll take them a
while to catch us even by flying, but we should be ready for them at all times.”
And this time they will find I am not so easily bound with chains,said Saphira.
Murtagh scratched his chin. “I hope they won’t be able to follow us past Bullridge. The Ramr was an
effective way to lose pursuers; there’s a good chance our tracks won’t be found again.”
“Something to hope for indeed,” said Eragon as he checked the elf. Her condition was unchanged; she
still did not react to his ministrations. “I place no faith in luck right now, though. The Ra’zac could be on
our trail even as we speak.”

At sunset they arrived at the crags they had viewed from afar that morning. The imposing stone bluffs
towered over them, casting thin shadows. The surrounding area was free of dunes for a half mile. Heat
assailed Eragon like a physical blow as he dismounted Snowfire onto the baked, cracked ground. The
back of his neck and his face were sunburned; his skin was hot and feverish.
After picketing the horses where they could nibble the sparse grass, Murtagh started a small fire. “How
far do you think we went?” Eragon asked, releasing the elf from Saphira.
“I don’t know!” snapped Murtagh. His skin was red, his eyes bloodshot. He picked up a pot and
muttered a curse. “We don’t have enough water. And the horses have to drink.”
Eragon was just as irritated by the heat and dryness, but he held his temper in check. “Bring the horses.”
Saphira dug a hole for him with her claws, then he closed his eyes, releasing the spell. Though the ground
was parched, there was enough moisture for the plants to live on and enough for him to fill the hole
several times over.
Murtagh refilled the waterskins as water pooled in the hole, then stood aside and let the horses drink.
The thirsty animals quaffed gallons. Eragon was forced to draw the liquid from ever deeper in the earth to
satisfy their desire. It taxed his strength to the limit. When the horses were finally sated, he said to
Saphira,If you need a drink, take it now.Her head snaked around him and she took two long draughts,
but no more.
Before letting the water flow back into the ground, Eragon gulped down as much as he could, then
watched the last drops melt back into the dirt. Holding the water on the surface was harder than he had
expected.But at least it’s within my abilities, he reflected, remembering with some amusement how he had
once struggled to lift even a pebble.

It was freezing when they rose the next day. The sand had a pink hue in the morning light, and the sky
was hazy, concealing the horizon. Murtagh’s mood had not improved with sleep, and Eragon found his
own rapidly deteriorating. During breakfast, he asked, “Do you think it’ll be long before we leave the
desert?”
Murtagh glowered. “We’re only crossing a small section of it, so I can’t imagine that it’ll take us more
than two or three days.”
“But look how far we’ve already come.”
“All right, maybe it won’t! All I care about right now is getting out of the Hadarac as quickly as possible.
What we’re doing is hard enough without having to pick sand from our eyes every few minutes.”
They finished eating, then Eragon went to the elf. She lay as one dead—a corpse except for her
measured breathing. “Where lies your injury?” whispered Eragon, brushing a strand of hair from her face.
“How can you sleep like this and yet live?” The image of her, alert and poised in the prison cell, was still
vivid in his mind. Troubled, he prepared the elf for travel, then saddled and mounted Snowfire.
As they left the camp, a line of dark smudges became visible on the horizon, indistinct in the hazy air.
Murtagh thought they were distant hills. Eragon was not convinced, but he could make out no details.
The elf’s plight filled his thoughts. He was sure that something had to be done to help her or she would
die, though he knew not what that might be. Saphira was just as concerned. They talked about it for
hours, but neither of them knew enough about healing to solve the problem confronting them.
At midday they stopped for a brief rest. When they resumed their journey, Eragon noticed that the haze
had thinned since morning, and the distant smudges had gained definition.
No longer were they indistinct purple-blue lumps, but rather broad, forest-covered mounds with clear
outlines. The air above them was pale white, bleached of its usual hue—all color seemed to have been
leached out of a horizontal band of sky that lay on top of the hills and extended to the horizon’s edges.
He stared, puzzled, but the more he tried to make sense of it, the more confused he became. He blinked
and shook his head, thinking that it must be some illusion of the desert air. Yet when he opened his eyes,
the annoying incongruity was still there. Indeed, the whiteness blanketed half the sky before them. Sure
that something was terribly wrong, he started to point this out to Murtagh and Saphira when he suddenly
understood what he was seeing.
What they had taken to be hills were actually the bases of gigantic mountains, scores of miles wide.
Except for the dense forest along their lower regions, the mountains were entirely covered with snow and
ice. It was this that had deceived Eragon into thinking the sky white. He craned back his neck, searching
for the peaks, but they were not visible. The mountains stretched up into the sky until they faded from
sight. Narrow, jagged valleys with ridges that nearly touched split the mountains like deep gorges. It was
like a ragged, toothy wall linking Alagaësia with the heavens.
There’s no end to them!he thought, awestruck. Stories that mentioned the Beor Mountains always noted
their size, but he had discounted such reports as fanciful embellishments. Now, however, he was forced
to acknowledge their authenticity.

Page 200

Sensing his wonder and surprise, Saphira followed his gaze with her own. Within a few seconds she
recognized the mountains for what they were.I feel like a hatchling again. Compared to them, even I feel
small!
We must be near the edge of the desert,said Eragon.It’s only taken two days and we can already see
the far side and beyond!
Saphira spiraled above the dunes.Yes, but considering the size of those peaks, they could still be fifty
leagues from here. It’s hard to gauge distances against something so immense. Wouldn’t they be a
perfect hiding place for the elves or the Varden?
You could hide more than the elves and Varden,he stated.Entire nations could exist in secret there,
hidden from the Empire. Imagine living with those behemoths looming over you! He guided Snowfire to
Murtagh and pointed, grinning.
“What?” grunted Murtagh, scanning the land.
“Look closely,” urged Eragon.
Murtagh peered closely at the horizon. He shrugged. “What, I don’t—” The words died in his mouth
and gave way to slack-jawed wonder. Murtagh shook his head, muttering, “That’s impossible!” He
squinted so hard that the corners of his eyes crinkled. He shook his head again. “I knew the Beor
Mountains were large, but not that monstrous size!”
“Let’s hope the animals that live there aren’t in proportion to the mountains,” said Eragon lightly.
Murtagh smiled. “It will be good to find some shade and spend a few weeks in leisure. I’ve had enough
of this forced march.”
“I’m tired too,” admitted Eragon, “but I don’t want to stop until the elf is cured… or she dies.”
“I don’t see how continuing to travel will help her,” said Murtagh gravely. “A bed will do her more good
than hanging underneath Saphira all day.”
Eragon shrugged. “Maybe… When we reach the mountains, I could take her to Surda—it’s not that far.
There must be a healer there who can help her; we certainly can’t.”
Murtagh shaded his eyes with his hand and stared at the mountains. “We can talk about it later. For now
our goal is to reach the Beors. There, at least, the Ra’zac will have trouble finding us, and we will be safe
from the Empire.”
As the day wore on, the Beor Mountains seemed to get no closer, though the landscape changed
dramatically. The sand slowly transformed from loose grains of reddish hue to hard-packed,
dusky-cream dirt. In place of dunes were ragged patches of plants and deep furrows in the ground where
flooding had occurred. A cool breeze wafted through the air, bringing welcome refreshment. The horses
sensed the change of climate and hurried forward eagerly.
When evening subdued the sun, the mountains’ foothills were a mere league away. Herds of gazelles
bounded through lush fields of waving grass. Eragon caught Saphira eyeing them hungrily. They camped
by a stream, relieved to be out of the punishing Hadarac Desert.

APATHREVEALED
Fatigued and haggard, but with triumphant smiles, they sat around the fire, congratulating each other.
Saphira crowed jubilantly, which startled the horses. Eragon stared at the flames. He was proud that they
had covered roughly sixty leagues in five days. It was an impressive feat, even for a rider able to change
mounts regularly.
I am outside of the Empire.It was a strange thought. He had been born in the Empire, lived his entire life
under Galbatorix’s rule, lost his closest friends and family to the king’s servants, and had nearly died
several times within his domain. Now Eragon was free. No more would he and Saphira have to dodge
soldiers, avoid towns, or hide who they were. It was a bittersweet realization, for the cost had been the
loss of his entire world.
He looked at the stars in the gloaming sky. And though the thought of building a home in the safety of
isolation appealed to him, he had witnessed too many wrongs committed in Galbatorix’s name, from
murder to slavery, to turn his back on the Empire. No longer was it just vengeance—for Brom’s death as
well as Garrow’s—that drove him. As a Rider, it was his duty to assist those without strength to resist
Galbatorix’s oppression.
With a sigh he abandoned his deliberation and observed the elf stretched out by Saphira. The fire’s
orange light gave her face a warm cast. Smooth shadows flickered under her cheekbones. As he stared,
an idea slowly came to him.
He could hear the thoughts of people and animals—and communicate with them in that manner if he
chose to—but it was something he had done infrequently except with Saphira. He always remembered
Brom’s admonishment not to violate someone’s mind unless absolutely necessary. Save for the one time
he had tried to probe Murtagh’s consciousness, he had refrained from doing so.
Now, however, he wondered if it were possible to contact the elf in her comatose state.I might be able
to learn from her memories why she remains like this. But if she recovers, would she forgive me for such
an intrusion? … Whether she does or not, I must try. She’s been in this condition for almost a week.
Without speaking of his intentions to Murtagh or Saphira, he knelt by the elf and placed his palm on her
brow.
Eragon closed his eyes and extended a tendril of thought, like a probing finger, toward the elf’s mind. He
found it without difficulty. It was not fuzzy and filled with pain as he had anticipated, but lucid and clear,
like a note from a crystal bell. Suddenly an icy dagger drove into his mind. Pain exploded behind his eyes
with splashes of color. He recoiled from the attack but found himself held in an iron grip, unable to
retreat.
Eragon fought as hard as he could and used every defense he could think of. The dagger stabbed into his
mind again. He frantically threw his own barriers before it, blunting the attack. The pain was less
excruciating than the first time, but it jarred his concentration. The elf took the opportunity to ruthlessly
crush his defenses.
A stifling blanket pressed down on Eragon from all directions, smothering his thoughts. The
overpowering force slowly contracted, squeezing the life out of him bit by bit, though he held on, unwilling
to give up.
The elf tightened her relentless grip even more, so as to extinguish him like a snuffed candle. He

Page 202

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

desperately cried in the ancient language, “Eka aí fricai un Shur’tugal!” I am a Rider and friend! The
deadly embrace did not loosen its hold, but its constriction halted and surprise emanated from her.
Suspicion followed a second later, but he knew she would believe him; he could not have lied in the
ancient language. However, while he had said he was a friend, that did not mean he meant her no harm.
For all she knew, Eragon believed himself to be her friend, making the statement true for him, thoughshe
might not consider him one.The ancient language does have its limitations, thought Eragon, hoping that the
elf would be curious enough to risk freeing him.
She was. The pressure lifted, and the barriers around her mind hesitantly lowered. The elf warily let their
thoughts touch, like two wild animals meeting for the first time. A cold shiver ran down Eragon’s side.
Her mind was alien. It felt vast and powerful, weighted with memories of uncounted years. Dark thoughts
loomed out of sight and touch, artifacts of her race that made him cringe when they brushed his
consciousness. Yet through all the sensations shimmered a melody of wild, haunting beauty that
embodied her identity.
What is your name?she asked, speaking in the ancient language. Her voice was weary and filled with
quiet despair.
Eragon. And yours?Her consciousness lured him closer, inviting him to submerge himself in the lyric
strains of her blood. He resisted the summons with difficulty, though his heart ached to accept it. For the
first time he understood the fey attraction of elves. They were creatures of magic, unbound by the mortal
laws of the land—as different from humans as dragons were from animals.
…Arya. Why have you contacted me in this manner? Am I still a captive of the Empire?
No, you are free!said Eragon. Though he knew only scattered words in the ancient language, he
managed to convey:I was imprisoned in Gil’ead, like you, but I escaped and rescued you. In the five
days since then, we’ve crossed the edge of the Hadarac Desert and are now camped by the Beor
Mountains. You’ve not stirred nor said a word in all that time.
Ah… so it was Gil’ead.She paused.I know that my wounds were healed. At the time I did not
understand why—preparation for some new torture, I was certain. Now I realize it was you. Softly she
added,Even so, I have not risen, and you are puzzled.
Yes.
During my captivity, a rare poison, the Skilna Bragh, was given to me, along with the drug to suppress
my power. Every morning the antidote for the previous day’s poison was administered to me, by force if
I refused to take it. Without it I will die within a few hours. That is why I lie in this trance—it slows the
Skilna Bragh’s progress, though does not stop it… I contemplated waking for the purpose of ending my
life and denying Galbatorix, but I refrained from doing so out of hope that you might be an ally…Her
voice dwindled off weakly.
How long can you remain like this?asked Eragon.
For weeks, but I’m afraid I haven’t that much time. This dormancy cannot restrain death forever… I can
feel it in my veins even now. Unless I receive the antidote, I will succumb to the poison in three or four
days.
Where can the antidote be found?

It exists in only two places outside of the Empire: with my own people and with the Varden. However,
my home is beyond the reach of dragonback.
What about the Varden? We would have taken you straight to them, but we don’t know where they are.
I will tell you—if you give me your word that you will never reveal their location to Galbatorix or to
anyone who serves him. In addition you must swear that you have not deceived me in some manner and
that you intend no harm to the elves, dwarves, Varden, or the race of dragons.
What Arya asked for would have been simple enough—if they had not been conversing in the ancient
language. Eragon knew she wanted oaths more binding than life itself. Once made, they could never be
broken. That weighed heavily on him as he gravely pledged his word in agreement.
It is understood…A series of vertigo-inducing images suddenly flashed through his mind. He found
himself riding along the Beor Mountain range, traveling eastward many leagues. Eragon did his best to
remember the route as craggy mountains and hills flashed past. He was heading south now, still following
the mountains. Then everything wheeled abruptly, and he entered a narrow, winding valley. It snaked
through the mountains to the base of a frothy waterfall that pounded into a deep lake.
The images stopped.It is far, said Arya,but do not let the distance dissuade you. When you arrive at the
lake Kóstha-mérna at the end of the Beartooth River, take a rock, bang on the cliff next to the waterfall,
and cry,Aí varden abr du Shur’tugals gata vanta.You will be admitted. You will be challenged, but do not
falter no matter how perilous it seems.
What should they give you for the poison?he asked.
Her voice quavered, but then she regained her strength.Tell them—to give me Túnivor’s Nectar. You
must leave me now… I have expended too much energy already. Do not talk with me again unless there
is no hope of reaching the Varden. If that is the case, there is information I must impart to you so the
Varden will survive. Farewell, Eragon, rider of dragons… my life is in your hands.
Arya withdrew from their contact. The unearthly strains that had echoed across their link were gone.
Eragon took a shuddering breath and forced his eyes open. Murtagh and Saphira stood on either side of
him, watching with concern. “Are you all right?” asked Murtagh. “You’ve been kneeling here for almost
fifteen minutes.”
“I have?” asked Eragon, blinking.
Yes, and grimacing like a pained gargoyle,commented Saphira dryly.
Eragon stood, wincing as his cramped knees stretched. “I talked with Arya!” Murtagh frowned
quizzically, as if to inquire if he had gone mad. Eragon explained, “The elf—that’s her name.”
And what is it that ails her?asked Saphira impatiently.
Eragon swiftly told them of his entire discussion. “How far away are the Varden?” asked Murtagh.
“I’m not exactly sure,” confessed Eragon. “From what she showed me, I think it’s even farther than from
here to Gil’ead.”

Page 204

“And we’re supposed to cover that in three or four days?” demanded Murtagh angrily. “It took us five
long days to get here! What do you want to do, kill the horses? They’re exhausted as it is.”
“But if we do nothing, she’ll die! If it’s too much for the horses, Saphira can fly ahead with Arya and me;
at least we would get to the Varden in time. You could catch up with us in a few days.”
Murtagh grunted and crossed his arms. “Of course. Murtagh the pack animal. Murtagh the horse leader.
I should have remembered that’s all I’m good for nowadays. Oh, and let’s not forget, every soldier in the
Empire is searching for me now because you couldn’t defend yourself, and I had to go andsave you.
Yes, I suppose I’ll just follow your instructions and bring up the horses in the rear like a good servant.”
Eragon was bewildered by the sudden venom in Murtagh’s voice. “What’s wrong with you? I’m grateful
for what you did. There’s no reason to be angry with me! I didn’t ask you to accompany me or to rescue
me from Gil’ead. You chose that. I haven’t forced you to do anything.”
“Oh, not openly, no. What else could I do but help you with the Ra’zac? And then later, at Gil’ead, how
could I have left with a clear conscience? The problem with you,” said Murtagh, poking Eragon in the
chest, “is that you’re so totally helpless you force everyone to take care of you!”
The words stung Eragon’s pride; he recognized a grain of truth in them. “Don’t touch me,” he growled.
Murtagh laughed, a harsh note in his voice. “Or what, you’ll punch me? You couldn’t hit a brick wall.”
He went to shove Eragon again, but Eragon grabbed his arm and struck him in the stomach.
“I said, don’t touch me!”
Murtagh doubled over, swearing. Then he yelled and launched himself at Eragon. They fell in a tangle of
arms and legs, pounding on each other. Eragon kicked at Murtagh’s right hip, missed, and grazed the
fire. Sparks and burning embers scattered through the air.
They scrabbled across the ground, trying to get leverage. Eragon managed to get his feet under
Murtagh’s chest and kicked mightily. Murtagh flew upside down over Eragon’s head, landing flat on his
back with a solid thump.
Murtagh’s breath whooshed out. He rolled stiffly to his feet, then wheeled to face Eragon, panting
heavily. They charged each other once more. Saphira’s tail slapped between them, accompanied by a
deafening roar. Eragon ignored her and tried to jump over her tail, but a taloned paw caught him in midair
and flung him back to the ground.
Enough!
He futilely tried to push Saphira’s muscled leg off his chest and saw that Murtagh was likewise pinned.
Saphira roared again, snapping her jaws. She swung her head over Eragon and glared at him.You of all
people should know better! Fighting like starving dogs over a scrap of meat. What would Brom say?
Eragon felt his cheeks burn and averted his eyes. He knew what Brom would have said. Saphira held
them on the ground, letting them simmer, then said to Eragon pointedly,Now, if you don’t want to spend
the night under my foot, you will politely ask Murtagh what is troubling him. She snaked her head over to
Murtagh and stared down at him with an impassive blue eye.And tell him that I won’t stand for insults
from either of you.

Won’t you let us up?complained Eragon.
No.
Eragon reluctantly turned his head toward Murtagh, tasting blood in the side of his mouth. Murtagh
avoided his eyes and looked up at the sky. “Well, is she going to get off us?”
“No, not unless we talk… She wants me to ask you what’s really the problem,” said Eragon,
embarrassed.
Saphira growled an affirmative and continued to stare at Murtagh. It was impossible for him to escape
her piercing glare. Finally he shrugged, muttering something under his breath. Saphira’s claws tightened
on his chest, and her tail whistled through the air. Murtagh shot her an angry glance, then grudgingly said
louder, “I told you before: I don’t want to go to the Varden.”
Eragon frowned. Was that all that was the matter? “Don’t want to… or can’t?”
Murtagh tried to shove Saphira’s leg off him, then gave up with a curse. “Don’t want to! They’ll expect
things from me that I can’t deliver.”
“Did you steal something from them?”
“I wish it were that simple.”
Eragon rolled his eyes, exasperated. “Well, what is it, then? Did you kill someone important or bed the
wrong woman?”
“No, I was born,” said Murtagh cryptically. He pushed at Saphira again. This time she released them
both. They got to their feet under her watchful eye and brushed dirt from their backs.
“You’re avoiding the question,” Eragon said, dabbing his split lip.
“So what?” spat Murtagh as he stomped to the edge of the camp. After a minute he sighed. “It doesn’t
matter why I’m in this predicament, but I can tell you that the Varden wouldn’t welcome me even if I
came bearing the king’s head. Oh, they might greet me nicely enough and let me into their councils, but
trust me? Never. And if I were to arrive under less fortuitous circumstances, like the present ones, they’d
likely clap me in irons.”
“Won’t you tell me what this is about?” asked Eragon. “I’ve done things I’m not proud of, too, so it’s
not as if I’m going to pass judgment.”
Murtagh shook his head slowly, eyes glistening. “It isn’t like that. I haven’tdone anything to deserve this
treatment, though it would have been easier to atone for if I had. No… my only wrongdoing is existing in
the first place.” He stopped and took a shaky breath. “You see, my father—”
A sharp hiss from Saphira cut him off abruptly.Look!
They followed her gaze westward. Murtagh’s face paled. “Demons above and below!”
A league or so away, parallel to the mountain range, was a column of figures marching east. The line of
troops, hundreds strong, stretched for nearly a mile. Dust billowed from their heels. Their weapons

Page 206

glinted in the dying light. A standard-bearer rode before them in a black chariot, holding aloft a crimson
banner.
“It’s the Empire,” said Eragon tiredly. “They’ve found us… somehow.” Saphira poked her head over his
shoulder and gazed at the column.
“Yes… but those are Urgals, not men,” said Murtagh.
“How can you tell?”
Murtagh pointed at the standard. “That flag bears the personal symbol of an Urgal chieftain. He’s a
ruthless brute, given to violent fits and insanity.”
“You’ve met him?”
Murtagh’s eyes tightened. “Once, briefly. I still have scars from that encounter. These Urgals might not
have been sent here for us, but I’m sure we’ve been seen by now and that they will follow us. Their
chieftain isn’t the sort to let a dragon escape his grasp, especially if he’s heard about Gil’ead.”
Eragon hurried to the fire and covered it with dirt. “We have to flee! You don’t want to go to the
Varden, but I have to take Arya to them before she dies. Here’s a compromise: come with me until I
reach the lake Kóstha-mérna, then go your own way.” Murtagh hesitated. Eragon added quickly, “If you
leave now, in sight of the column, Urgals will follow you. And then where will you be, facing them alone?”
“Very well,” said Murtagh, tossing his saddlebags over Tornac’s flanks, “but when we near the Varden,
Iwill leave.”
Eragon burned to question Murtagh further, but not with Urgals so near. He gathered his belongings and
saddled Snowfire. Saphira fanned her wings, took off in a rush, and circled above. She kept guard over
Murtagh and Eragon as they left camp.
What direction shall I fly?she asked.
East, along the Beors.
Stilling her wings, Saphira rose on an updraft and teetered on the pillar of warm air, hovering in the sky
over the horses. I wonder why the Urgals are here. Maybe they were sent to attack the Varden.
Then we should try to warn them,he said, guiding Snowfire past half-visible obstacles. As the night
deepened, the Urgals faded into the gloom behind them.
ACLASH OFWILLS
When morning came, Eragon’s cheek was raw from chafing against Snowfire’s neck, and he was sore
from his fight with Murtagh. They had alternated sleeping in their saddles throughout the night. It had
allowed them to outdistance the Urgal troops, but neither of them knew if the lead could be retained. The
horses were exhausted to the point of stopping, yet they still maintained a relentless pace. Whether it
would be enough to escape depended on how rested the monsters were… and if Eragon and Murtagh’s
horses survived.
The Beor Mountains cast great shadows over the land, stealing the sun’s warmth. To the north was the

Page 207

Hadarac Desert, a thin white band as bright as noonday snow.
I must eat,said Saphira.Days have passed since I last hunted. Hunger claws my belly. If I start now, I
might be able to catch enough of those bounding deer for a few mouthfuls.
Eragon smiled at her exaggeration.Go if you must, but leave Arya here.
I will be swift.He untied the elf from her belly and transferred her to Snowfire’s saddle. Saphira soared
away, disappearing in the direction of the mountains. Eragon ran beside the horses, close enough to
Snowfire to keep Arya from falling. Neither he nor Murtagh intruded on the silence. Yesterday’s fight no
longer seemed as important because of the Urgals, but the bruises remained.

Saphira made her kills within the hour and notified Eragon of her success. Eragon was pleased that she
would soon return. Her absence made him nervous.
They stopped at a pond to let the horses drink. Eragon idly plucked a stalk of grass, twirling it while he
stared at the elf. He was startled from his reverie by the steely rasp of a sword being unsheathed. He
instinctively grasped Zar’roc and spun around in search of the enemy. There was only Murtagh, his long
sword held ready. He pointed at a hill ahead of them, where a tall, brown-cloaked man sat on a sorrel
horse, mace in hand. Behind him was a group of twenty horsemen. No one moved. “Could they be
Varden?” asked Murtagh.
Eragon surreptitiously strung his bow. “According to Arya, they’re still scores of leagues away. This
might be one of their patrols or raiding groups.”
“Assuming they’re not bandits.” Murtagh swung onto Tornac and readied his own bow.
“Should we try to outrun them?” asked Eragon, draping a blanket over Arya. The horsemen must have
seen her, but he hoped to conceal the fact that she was an elf.
“It wouldn’t do any good,” said Murtagh, shaking his head. “Tornac and Snowfire are fine war-horses,
but they’re tired, and they aren’t sprinters. Look at the horses those men have; they’re meant for running.
They would catch us before we had gone a half-mile. Besides, they may have something important to
say. You’d better tell Saphira to hurry back.”
Eragon was already doing that. He explained the situation, then warned,Don’t show yourself unless it’s
necessary. We’re not in the Empire, but I still don’t want anyone to know about you.
Never mind that,she replied.Remember, magic can protect you where speed and luck fail. He felt her
take off and race toward them, skimming close to the ground.
The band of men watched them from the hill.
Eragon nervously gripped Zar’roc. The wire-wrapped hilt was secure under his glove. He said in a low
voice, “If they threaten us, I can frighten them away with magic. If that doesn’t work, there’s Saphira. I
wonder how they’d react to a Rider? So many stories have been told about their powers… It might be
enough to avoid a fight.”
“Don’t count on it,” said Murtagh flatly. “If there’s a fight, we’ll just have to kill enough of them to

convince them we’re not worth the effort.” His face was controlled and unemotional.
The man on the sorrel horse signaled with his mace, sending the horsemen cantering toward them. The
men shook javelins over their heads, whooping loudly as they neared. Battered sheaths hung from their
sides. Their weapons were rusty and stained. Four of them trained arrows on Eragon and Murtagh.
Their leader swirled the mace in the air, and his men responded with yells as they wildly encircled
Eragon and Murtagh. Eragon’s lips twitched. He almost loosed a blast of magic into their midst, then
restrained himself.We don’t know what they want yet, he reminded himself, containing his growing
apprehension.
The moment Eragon and Murtagh were thoroughly surrounded, the leader reined in his horse, then
crossed his arms and examined them critically. He raised his eyebrows. “Well, these are better than the
usual dregs we find! At least we got healthy ones this time. And we didn’t even have to shoot them.
Grieg will be pleased.” The men chuckled.
At his words, a sinking sensation filled Eragon’s gut. A suspicion stirred in his mind.Saphira…
“Now as for you two,” said the leader, speaking to Eragon and Murtagh, “if you would be so good as to
drop your weapons, you’ll avoid being turned into living quivers by my men.” The archers grinned
suggestively; the men laughed again.
Murtagh’s only movement was to shift his sword. “Who are you and what do you want? We are free
men traveling through this land. You have no right to stop us.”
“Oh, I have every right,” said the man contemptuously. “And as for my name,slavesdo not address their
masters in that manner, unless they want to be beaten.”
Eragon cursed to himself.Slavers! He remembered vividly the people he had seen at auction in
Dras-Leona. Rage boiled within him. He glared at the men around him with new hatred and disgust.
The lines deepened on the leader’s face. “Throw down your swords and surrender!” The slavers tensed,
staring at them with cold eyes as neither Eragon nor Murtagh lowered his weapon. Eragon’s palm tingled.
He heard a rustle behind him, then a loud curse. Startled, he spun around.
One of the slavers had pulled the blanket off Arya, revealing her face. He gaped in astonishment, then
shouted, “Torkenbrand, this one’s an elf!” The men stirred with surprise while the leader spurred his
horse over to Snowfire. He looked down at Arya and whistled.
“Well, ’ow much is she worth?” someone asked.
Torkenbrand was quiet for a moment, then spread his hands and said, “At the very least? Fortunes upon
fortunes. The Empire will pay a mountain of gold for her!”
The slavers yelled with excitement and pounded each other on the back. A roar filled Eragon’s mind as
Saphira banked sharply far overhead.Attack now! he cried.But let them escape if they run. She
immediately folded her wings and plummeted downward. Eragon caught Murtagh’s attention with a sharp
signal. Murtagh took the cue. He smashed his elbow into a slaver’s face, knocking the man out of his
saddle, and jabbed his heels into Tornac.
With a toss of his mane, the war-horse jumped forward, twirled around, and reared. Murtagh

Page 209

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

brandished his sword as Tornac plunged back down, driving his forehooves into the back of the
dismounted slaver. The man screamed.
Before the slavers could gather their senses, Eragon scrambled out of the commotion and raised his
hands, invoking words in the ancient language. A globule of indigo fire struck the ground in the midst of
the fray, bursting into a fountain of molten drops that dissipated like sun-warmed dew. A second later,
Saphira dropped from the sky and landed next to him. She parted her jaws, displaying her massive fangs,
and bellowed. “Behold!” cried Eragon over the furor, “I am a Rider!” He raised Zar’roc over his head,
the red blade dazzling in the sunlight, then pointed it at the slavers. “Flee if you wish to live!”
The men shouted incoherently and scrambled over each other in their haste to escape. In the confusion,
Torkenbrand was struck in the temple with a javelin. He tumbled to the ground, stunned. The men
ignored their fallen leader and raced away in a ragged mass, casting fearful looks at Saphira.
Torkenbrand struggled to his knees. Blood ran from his temple, branching across his cheek with crimson
tendrils. Murtagh dismounted and strode over to him, sword in hand. Torkenbrand weakly raised his arm
as if to ward off a blow. Murtagh gazed at him coldly, then swung his blade at Torkenbrand’s neck.
“No!” shouted Eragon, but it was too late.
Torkenbrand’s decapitated trunk crumpled to the ground in a puff of dirt. His head landed with a hard
thump. Eragon rushed to Murtagh, his jaw working furiously. “Is your brain rotten?” he yelled, enraged.
“Why did you kill him?”
Murtagh wiped his sword on the back of Torkenbrand’s jerkin. The steel left a dark stain. “I don’t see
why you’re so upset—”
“Upset!” exploded Eragon. “I’m well past that! Did it even occur to you that we could just leave him
here and continue on our way? No! Instead you turn into an executioner and chop off his head. He was
defenseless!”
Murtagh seemed perplexed by Eragon’s wrath. “Well, we couldn’t keep him around—hewas
dangerous. The others ran off… without a horse he wouldn’t have made it far. I didn’t want the Urgals to
find him and learn about Arya. So I thought it would—”
“But tokill him?” interrupted Eragon. Saphira sniffed Torkenbrand’s head curiously. She opened her
mouth slightly, as if to snap it up, then appeared to decide better of it and prowled to Eragon’s side.
“I’m only trying to stay alive,” stated Murtagh. “No stranger’s life is more important than my own.”
“But you can’t indulge in wanton violence. Where is your empathy?” growled Eragon, pointing at the
head.
“Empathy? Empathy? What empathy can I afford my enemies? Shall I dither about whether to defend
myself because it will cause someone pain? If that had been the case, I would have died years ago! You
must be willing to protect yourself and what you cherish, no matter what the cost.”
Eragon slammed Zar’roc back into its sheath, shaking his head savagely. “You can justify any atrocity
with that reasoning.”
“Do you think I enjoy this?” Murtagh shouted. “My life has been threatened from the day I was born!
All of my waking hours have been spent avoiding danger in one form or another. And sleep never comes

easily because I always worry if I’ll live to see the dawn. If there ever was a time I felt secure, it must
have been in my mother’s womb, though I wasn’t safe even there! You don’t understand—if you lived
with thisfear, you would have learned the same lesson I did:Do not take chances. ” He gestured at
Torkenbrand’s body. “He was a risk that I removed. I refuse to repent, and I won’t plague myself over
what is done and past.”
Eragon shoved his face into Murtagh’s. “It was still the wrong thing to do.” He lashed Arya to Saphira,
then climbed onto Snowfire. “Let’s go.” Murtagh guided Tornac around Torkenbrand’s prone form in
the bloodstained dust.

They rode at a rate that Eragon would have thought impossible a week ago; leagues melted away before
them as if wings were attached to their feet. They turned south, between two outstretched arms of the
Beor Mountains. The arms were shaped like pincers about to close, the tips a day’s travel apart. Yet the
distance seemed less because of the mountains’ size. It was as if they were in a valley made for giants.
When they stopped for the day, Eragon and Murtagh ate dinner in silence, refusing to look up from their
food. Afterward, Eragon said tersely, “I’ll take the first watch.” Murtagh nodded and lay on his blankets
with his back to Eragon.
Do you want to talk?asked Saphira.
Not right now,murmured Eragon.Give me some time to think; I’m… confused.
She withdrew from his mind with a gentle touch and a whisper.I love you, little one.
And I you,he said. She curled into a ball next to him, lending him her warmth. He sat motionless in the
dark, wrestling with his disquiet.
FLIGHTTHROUGH THEVALLEY
In the morning Saphira took off with both Eragon and Arya. Eragon wanted to get away from Murtagh
for a time. He shivered, pulling his clothes tighter. It looked like it might snow. Saphira ascended lazily on
an updraft and asked,What are you thinking?
Eragon contemplated the Beor Mountains, which towered above them even though Saphira flew far
above the ground.That was murder yesterday. I’ve no other word for it.
Saphira banked to the left. It was a hasty deed and ill considered, but Murtagh tried to do the right thing.
The men who buy and sell other humans deserve every misfortune that befalls them. If we weren’t
committed to helping Arya, I would hunt down every slaver and tear them apart!
Yes,said Eragon miserably,but Torkenbrand was helpless. He couldn’t shield himself or run. A moment
more and he probably would have surrendered. Murtagh didn’t give him that chance. If Torkenbrand had
at least been able to fight, it wouldn’t have been so bad.
Eragon, even if Torkenbrand had fought, the results would have been the same. You know as well as I
do that few can equal you or Murtagh with the blade. Torkenbrand would have still died, though you
seem to think it would have been more just or honorable in a mismatched duel.

Page 211

I don’t know what’s right!admitted Eragon, distressed.There aren’t any answers that make sense.
Sometimes,said Saphira gently,there are no answers. Learn what you can about Murtagh from this. Then
forgive him. And if you can’t forgive, at least forget, for he meant you no harm, however rash the act
was. Your head is still attached, yes?
Frowning, Eragon shifted in the saddle. He shook himself, like a horse trying to rid itself of a fly, and
checked Murtagh’s position over Saphira’s shoulder. A patch of color farther back along their route
caught his attention.
Camped by a streambed they had crossed late yesterday were the Urgals. Eragon’s heartbeat
quickened. How could the Urgals be on foot, yet still gain on them? Saphira saw the monsters as well
and tilted her wings, brought them close to her body, and slipped into a steep dive, splitting the air.I don’t
think they spotted us, she said.
Eragon hoped not. He squinted against the blast of air as she increased the angle of their dive.Their
chieftain must be driving them at a breakneck pace, he said.
Yes—maybe they’ll all die of exhaustion.
When they landed, Murtagh asked curtly, “What now?”
“The Urgals are overtaking us,” said Eragon. He pointed back toward the column’s camp.
“How far do we still have to go?” asked Murtagh, putting his hands against the sky and measuring the
hours until sunset.
“Normally? …I would guess another five days. At the speed we’ve been traveling, only three. But unless
we get there tomorrow, the Urgals will probably catch us, and Arya will certainly die.”
“She might last another day.”
“We can’t count on it,” objected Eragon. “The only way we can get to the Varden in time is if we don’t
stop for anything, least of all sleep. That’s our only chance.”
Murtagh laughed bitterly. “How can you expect to do that? We’ve already gone days without adequate
sleep. Unless Riders are made of different stuff than us mortals, you’re as tired as I am. We’ve covered a
staggering distance, and the horses, in case you haven’t noticed, are ready to drop. Another day of this
might kill us all.”
Eragon shrugged. “So be it. We don’t have a choice.”
Murtagh gazed at the mountains. “I could leave and let you fly ahead with Saphira… That would force
the Urgals to divide their troops and would give you a better chance of reaching the Varden.”
“It would be suicide,” said Eragon, crossing his arms. “Somehow those Urgals are faster on foot than we
are on horseback. They would run you down like a deer. The only way to evade them is to find
sanctuary with the Varden.” Despite his words, he was unsure if he wanted Murtagh to stay.I like him,
Eragon confessed to himself,but I’m no longer certain if that’s a good thing.
“I’ll escape later,” said Murtagh abruptly. “When we get to the Varden, I can disappear down a side

Page 212

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

valley and find my way to Surda, where I can hide without attracting too much attention.”
“So you’re staying?”
“Sleep or no sleep, I’ll see you to the Varden,” promised Murtagh.

With newfound determination, they struggled to distance themselves from the Urgals, yet their pursuers
continued to creep nearer. At nightfall the monsters were a third closer than they had been that morning.
As fatigue eroded his and Murtagh’s strength, they slept in turns on the horses, while whoever was
awake led the animals in the right direction.
Eragon relied heavily on Arya’s memories to guide them. Because of the alien nature of her mind, he
sometimes made mistakes as to the route, costing them precious time. They gradually angled toward the
foothills of the eastern arm of mountains, looking for the valley that would lead them to the Varden.
Midnight arrived and passed without any sign of it.

When the sun returned, they were pleased to see that the Urgals were far behind. “This is the last day,”
said Eragon, yawning widely. “If we’re not reasonably close to the Varden by noon, I’m going to fly
ahead with Arya. You’ll be free to go wherever you want then, but you’ll have to take Snowfire with
you. I won’t be able to come back for him.”
“That might not be necessary; we could still get there in time,” said Murtagh. He rubbed the pommel of
his sword.
Eragon shrugged. “We could.” He went to Arya and put a hand on her forehead. It was damp and
dangerously hot. Her eyes wandered uneasily beneath her eyelids, as if she suffered a nightmare. Eragon
pressed a damp rag to her brow, wishing he could do more.

Late in the morning, after they circumnavigated an especially broad mountain, Eragon saw a narrow
valley tucked against its far side. The valley was so restricted it could easily be overlooked. The
Beartooth River, which Arya had mentioned, flowed out of it and looped carelessly across the land. He
smiled with relief; that was where they needed to go.
Looking back, Eragon was alarmed to see that the distance between them and the Urgals had shrunk to
little more than a league. He pointed out the valley to Murtagh. “If we can slip in there without being seen,
it might confuse them.”
Murtagh looked skeptical. “It’s worth a try. But they’ve followed us easily enough so far.”
As they approached the valley, they passed under the knotted branches of the Beor Mountains’ forest.
The trees were tall, with creviced bark that was almost black, dull needles of the same color, and knobby
roots that rose from the soil like bare knees. Cones littered the ground, each the size of a horse’s head.
Sable squirrels chattered from the treetops, and eyes gleamed from holes in the trunks. Green beards of
tangled wolfsbane hung from the gnarled branches.

Page 213

The forest gave Eragon an uneasy feeling; the hair on the back of his neck prickled. There was
something hostile in the air, as if the trees resented their intrusion.They are very old, said Saphira,
touching a trunk with her nose.
Yes,said Eragon,but not friendly.The forest grew denser the farther in they traveled. The lack of space
forced Saphira to take off with Arya. Without a clear trail to follow, the tough underbrush slowed Eragon
and Murtagh. The Beartooth River wound next to them, filling the air with the sound of gurgling water. A
nearby peak obscured the sun, casting them into premature dusk.
At the valley’s mouth, Eragon realized that although it looked like a slim gash between the peaks, the
valley was really as wide as many of the Spine’s vales. It was only the enormous size of the ridged and
shadowy mountains that made it appear so confined. Waterfalls dotted its sheer sides. The sky was
reduced to a thin strip winding overhead, mostly hidden by gray clouds. From the dank ground rose a
clinging fog that chilled the air until their breath was visible. Wild strawberries crawled among a carpet of
mosses and ferns, fighting for the meager sunlight. Sprouting on piles of rotting wood were red and
yellow toadstools.
All was hushed and quiet, sounds dampened by the heavy air. Saphira landed by them in a nearby glade,
the rush of her wings strangely muted. She took in the view with a swing of her head.I just passed a flock
of birds that were black and green with red markings on their wings. I’ve never seen birds like that
before.
Everything in these mountains seems unusual,replied Eragon.Do you mind if I ride you awhile? I want to
keep an eye on the Urgals.
Of course.
He turned to Murtagh. “The Varden are hidden at the end of this valley. If we hurry, we might get there
before nightfall.”
Murtagh grunted, hands on his hips. “How am I going to get out of here? I don’t see any valleys joining
this one, and the Urgals are going to hem us in pretty soon. I need an escape route.”
“Don’t worry about it,” said Eragon impatiently. “This is a long valley; there’s sure to be an exit further
in.” He released Arya from Saphira and lifted the elf onto Snowfire. “Watch Arya—I’m going to fly with
Saphira. We’ll meet you up ahead.” He scrambled onto Saphira’s back and strapped himself onto her
saddle.
“Be careful,” Murtagh warned, his brow furrowed in thought, then clucked to the horses and hurried
back into the forest.
As Saphira jumped toward the sky, Eragon said,Do you think you could fly up to one of those peaks?
We might be able to spot our destination, as well as a passage for Murtagh. I don’t want to listen to him
griping through the entire valley.
We can try,agreed Saphira,but it will get much colder.
I’m dressed warmly.
Hold on, then!Saphira suddenly swooped straight up, throwing him back in the saddle. Her wings
flapped strongly, driving their weight upward. The valley shrank to a green line below them. The

Page 214

Beartooth River shimmered like braided silver where light struck it.
They rose to the cloud layer, and icy moisture saturated the air. A formless gray blanket engulfed them,
limiting their vision to an arm’s length. Eragon hoped they would not collide with anything in the murk. He
stuck out a hand experimentally, swinging it through the air. Water condensed on it and ran down his
arm, soaking his sleeve.
A blurred gray mass fluttered past his head, and he glimpsed a dove, its wings pumping frantically. There
was a white band around its leg. Saphira struck at the bird, tongue lashing out, jaws gaping. The dove
squawked as Saphira’s sharp teeth snapped together a hair’s breadth behind its tail feathers. Then it
darted away and disappeared into the haze, the frenzied thumping of its wings fading to silence.
When they breached the top of the clouds, Saphira’s scales were covered with thousands of water
droplets that reflected tiny rainbows and shimmered with the blue of her scales. Eragon shook himself,
spraying water from his clothes, and shivered. He could no longer see the ground, only hills of clouds
snaking between the mountains.
The trees on the mountains gave way to thick glaciers, blue and white under the sun. The glare from the
snow forced Eragon to close his eyes. He tried to open them after a minute, but the light dazzled him.
Irritated, he stared into the crook of his arm.How can you stand it? he asked Saphira.
My eyes are stronger than yours,she replied.
It was frigid. The water in Eragon’s hair froze, giving him a shiny helmet. His shirt and pants were hard
shells around his limbs. Saphira’s scales became slick with ice; hoarfrost laced her wings. They had never
flown this high before, yet the mountaintops were still miles above them.
Saphira’s flapping gradually slowed, and her breathing became labored. Eragon gasped and panted;
there didn’t seem to be enough air. Fighting back panic, he clutched Saphira’s neck spikes for support.
We… have to get out of here,he said. Red dots swam before his eyes.I can’t… breathe. Saphira
seemed not to hear him, so he repeated the message, louder this time. Again there was no response.She
can’t hear me, he realized. He swayed, finding it hard to think, then pounded on her side and shouted,
“Take us down!”
The effort made him lightheaded. His vision faded into swirling darkness.

He regained consciousness as they emerged from the bottom of the clouds. His head was pounding.
What happened? he asked, pushing himself upright and looking around with confusion.
You blacked out,answered Saphira.
He tried to run his fingers through his hair, but stopped when he felt icicles.Yes, I know that, but why
didn’t you answer me?
My brain was confused. Your words didn’t make any sense. When you lost consciousness, I knew
something was wrong and descended. I didn’t have to sink far before I realized what had occurred.
It’s a good thing you didn’t pass out as well,said Eragon with a nervous laugh. Saphira only swished her

tail. He looked wistfully at where the mountain peaks were now concealed by clouds.A pity we couldn’t
stand upon one of those summits… Well, now we know: we can only fly out of this valley the way we
came in. Why did we run out of air? How can we have it down here, but not up above?
I don’t know, but I’ll never dare to fly so close to the sun again. We should remember this experience.
The knowledge may be useful if we ever have to fight another Rider.
I hope that never happens,said Eragon.Let’s stay down below for now. I’ve had enough adventure for
one day.
They floated on the gentle air currents, drifting from one mountain to the next, until Eragon saw that the
Urgal column had reached the valley’s mouth.What drives them to such speed, and how can they bear to
sustain it?
Now that we are closer to them,Saphira said,I can see that these Urgals are bigger than the ones we’ve
met before. They would stand chest and shoulders over a tall man. I don’t know what land they march
from, but it must be a fierce place to produce such brutes.
Eragon glared at the ground below—he could not see the detail that she did.If they keep to this pace,
they’ll catch Murtagh before we find the Varden.
Have hope. The forest may hamper their progress… Would it be possible to stop them with magic?
Eragon shook his head.Stop them… no. There are too many. He thought of the thin layer of mist on the
valley floor and grinned.But I might be able to delay them a bit. He closed his eyes, selected the words
he needed, stared at the mist, and then commanded, “Gath un reisa du rakr!”
There was a disturbance below. From above, it looked as if the ground was flowing together like a great
sluggish river. A leaden band of mist gathered in front of the Urgals and thickened into an intimidating
wall, dark as a thunderhead. The Urgals hesitated before it, then continued forward like an unstoppable
battering ram. The barrier swirled around them, concealing the lead ranks from view.
The drain on Eragon’s strength was sudden and massive, making his heart flutter like a dying bird. He
gasped, eyes rolling. He struggled to sever the magic’s hold on him—to plug the breach through which
his life streamed. With a savage growl he jerked away from the magic and broke contact. Tendrils of
magic snapped through his mind like decapitated snakes, then reluctantly retreated from his
consciousness, clutching at the dregs of his strength. The wall of mist dissipated, and the fog sluggishly
collapsed across the ground like a tower of mud sliding apart. The Urgals had not been hindered at all.
Eragon lay limply on Saphira, panting. Only now did he remember Brom saying, “Magic is affected by
distance, just like an arrow or a spear. If you try to lift or move something a mile away, it’ll take more
energy than if you were closer.”I won’t forget that again, he thought grimly.
You shouldn’t have forgotten in the first place,Saphira inserted pointedly.First the dirt at Gil’ead and
now this. Weren’t you paying attention to anything Brom told you? You’ll kill yourself if you keep this up.
I paid attention,he insisted, rubbing his chin. It’s just been a while, and I haven’t had an opportunity to
think back on it. I’ve never used magic at a distance, so how could I know it would be so difficult?
She growled.Next thing I know you’ll be trying to bring corpses back to life. Don’t forget what Brom
said about that, too.

I won’t,he said impatiently. Saphira dipped toward the ground, searching for Murtagh and the horses.
Eragon would have helped her, but he barely had the energy to sit up.
Saphira settled in a small field with a jolt, and Eragon was puzzled to see the horses stopped and
Murtagh kneeling, examining the ground. When Eragon did not dismount, Murtagh hurried over and
inquired, “What’s wrong?” He sounded angry, worried, and tired at the same time.
“…I made a mistake,” said Eragon truthfully. “The Urgals have entered the valley. I tried to confuse
them, but I forgot one of the rules of magic, and it cost me a great deal.”
Scowling, Murtagh jerked his thumb over his shoulder. “I just found some wolf tracks, but the footprints
are as wide as both of my hands and an inch deep. There are animals around here that could be
dangerous even to you, Saphira.” He turned to her. “I know you can’t enter the forest, but could you
circle above me and the horses? That should keep these beasts away. Otherwise there may only be
enough left of me to roast in a thimble.”
“Humor, Murtagh?” asked Eragon, a quick smile coming to his face. His muscles trembled, making it
hard for him to concentrate.
“Only on the gallows.” Murtagh rubbed his eyes. “I can’t believe that the same Urgals have been
following us the whole time. They would have to be birds to catch up with us.”
“Saphira said they’re larger than any we’ve seen,” remarked Eragon.
Murtagh cursed, clenching the pommel of his sword. “That explains it! Saphira, if you’re right, then those
are Kull, elite of the Urgals. I should have guessed that the chieftain had been put in charge of them. They
don’t ride because horses can’t carry their weight—not one of them is under eight feet tall—and they can
run for days without sleep and still be ready for battle. It can take five men to kill one. Kull never leave
their caves except for war, so they must expect a great slaughter if they are out in such force.”
“Can we stay ahead of them?”
“Who knows?” said Murtagh. “They’re strong, determined, and large in numbers. It’s possible that we
may have to face them. If that happens, I only hope that the Varden have men posted nearby who’ll help
us. Despite our skill and Saphira, we can’t hold off Kull.”
Eragon swayed. “Could you get me some bread? I need to eat.” Murtagh quickly brought him part of a
loaf. It was old and hard, but Eragon chewed on it gratefully. Murtagh scanned the valley walls, worry in
his eyes. Eragon knew he was searching for a way out. “There’ll be one farther in.”
“Of course,” said Murtagh with forced optimism, then slapped his thigh. “We must go.”
“How is Arya?” asked Eragon.
Murtagh shrugged. “The fever’s worse. She’s been tossing and turning. What do you expect? Her
strength is failing. You should fly her to the Varden before the poison does any more damage.”
“I won’t leave you behind,” insisted Eragon, gaining strength with each bite. “Not with the Urgals so
near.”

Page 217

Murtagh shrugged again. “As you wish. But I’m warning you, she won’t live if you stay with me.”
“Don’t say that,” insisted Eragon, pushing himself upright in Saphira’s saddle. “Help me save her. We
can still do it. Consider it a life for a life—atonement for Torkenbrand’s death.”
Murtagh’s face darkened instantly. “It’s not a debt owed. You—” He stopped as a horn echoed
through the dark forest. “I’ll have more to say to you later,” he said shortly, stomping to the horses. He
grabbed their reins and trotted away, shooting an angry glare at Eragon.
Eragon closed his eyes as Saphira took flight. He wished that he could lie on a soft bed and forget all
their troubles. Saphira,he said at last, cupping his ears to warm them, what if we did take Arya to the
Varden? Once she was safe, we could fly back to Murtagh and help him out of here.
The Varden wouldn’t let you,said Saphira.For all they know, you might be returning to inform the Urgals
of their hiding place. We aren’t arriving under the best conditions to gain their trust. They’ll want to know
why we’ve brought an entire company of Kull to their very gates.
We’ll just have to tell them the truth and hope they believe us,said Eragon.
And what will we do if the Kull attack Murtagh?
Fight them, of course! I won’t let him and Arya be captured or killed,said Eragon indignantly.
There was a touch of sarcasm in her words.How noble. Oh, we would fell many of the Urgals—you
with magic and blade, whilst my weapons would be tooth and claw—but it would be futile in the end.
They are too numerous… We cannot defeat them, only be defeated.
What, then?he demanded.I’ll not leave Arya or Murtagh to their mercy.
Saphira waved her tail, the tip whistling loudly.I’m not asking you to. However, if we attack first, we
may gain the advantage.
Have you gone crazy? They’ll…Eragon’s voice trailed off as he thought about it.They won’t be able to
do a thing, he concluded, surprised.
Exactly,said Saphira.We can inflict lots of damage from a safe height.
Let’s drop rocks on them!proposed Eragon.That should scatter them.
If their skulls aren’t thick enough to protect them.Saphira banked to the right and quickly descended to
the Beartooth River. She grasped a mid-sized boulder with her strong talons while Eragon scooped up
several fist-sized rocks. Laden with the stones, Saphira glided on silent wings until they were over the
Urgal host.Now! she exclaimed, releasing the boulder. There were muffled cracks as the missiles
plummeted through the forest top, smashing branches. A second later howls echoed through the valley.
Eragon smiled tightly as he heard the Urgals scramble for cover.Let’s find more ammunition, he
suggested, bending low over Saphira. She growled in agreement and returned to the riverbed.
It was hard work, but they were able to hinder the Urgals’ progress—though it was impossible to stop
them altogether. The Urgals gained ground whenever Saphira went for stones. Despite that, their efforts
allowed Murtagh to stay ahead of the advancing column.

The valley darkened as the hours slipped by. Without the sun to provide warmth, the sharp bite of frost
crept into the air and the ground mist froze on the trees, coating them white. Night animals began to creep
from their dens to peer from shadowed hideouts at the strangers trespassing on their land.
Eragon continued to examine the mountainsides, searching for the waterfall that would signify the end of
their journey. He was painfully aware that every passing minute brought Arya closer to death. “Faster,
faster,” he muttered to himself, looking down at Murtagh. Before Saphira scooped up more rocks, he
said,Let’s take a respite and check on Arya. The day is almost over, and I’m afraid her life is measured
in hours, if not minutes.
Arya’s life is in Fate’s hands now. You made your choice to stay with Murtagh; it’s too late to change
that, so stop agonizing over it… You’re making my scales itch. The best thing we can do right now is to
keep bombarding the Urgals.Eragon knew she was right, yet her words did nothing to calm his anxiety.
He resumed his search for the waterfall, but whatever lay before them was hidden by a thick mountain
ridge.
True darkness began to fill the valley, settling over the trees and mountains like an inky cloud. Even with
her keen hearing and delicate sense of smell, Saphira could no longer locate the Urgals through the dense
forest. There was no moon to help them; it would be hours before it rose above the mountains.
Saphira made a long, gentle left turn and glided around the mountain ridge. Eragon vaguely sensed it
pass by them, then squinted as he saw a faint white line ahead.Could that be the waterfall? he wondered.
He looked at the sky, which still held the afterglow of sunset. The mountains’ dark silhouettes curved
together and formed a rough bowl that closed off the valley.The head of the valley isn’t much farther! he
exclaimed, pointing at the mountains.Do you think that the Varden know we’re coming? Maybe they’ll
send men out to help us.
I doubt they’ll assist us until they know if we are friend or foe,Saphira said as she abruptly dropped
toward the ground.I’m returning to Murtagh—we should stay with him now. Since I can’t find the Urgals,
they could sneak up on him without us knowing.
Eragon loosened Zar’roc in its sheath, wondering if he was strong enough to fight. Saphira landed to the
left of the Beartooth River, then crouched expectantly. The waterfall rumbled in the distance.He comes,
she said. Eragon strained his ears and caught the sound of pounding hooves. Murtagh ran out of the
forest, driving the horses before him. He saw them but did not slow.
Eragon jumped off Saphira, stumbling a bit as he matched Murtagh’s pace. Behind him Saphira went to
the river so she could follow them without being hindered by the trees. Before Eragon could relay his
news, Murtagh said, “I saw you dropping rocks with Saphira—ambitious. Have the Kull stopped or
turned back?”
“They’re still behind us, but we’re almost to the head of the valley. How’s Arya?”
“She hasn’t died,” Murtagh said harshly. His breath came in short bursts. His next words were
deceptively calm, like those of a man concealing a terrible passion. “Is there a valley or gorge ahead that
I can leave through?”
Apprehensive, Eragon tried to remember if he had seen any breaks in the mountains around them; he
had not thought about Murtagh’s dilemma for a while. “It’s dark,” he began evasively, dodging a low

Page 219

branch, “so I might have missed something, but… no.”
Murtagh swore explosively and came to an abrupt stop, dragging on the horses’ reins until they halted as
well. “Are you saying that the only place I can go is to the Varden?”
“Yes, but keep running. The Urgals are almost upon us!”
“No!” said Murtagh angrily. He stabbed a finger at Eragon. “I warned you that I wouldn’t go to the
Varden, but you went ahead and trapped me between a hammer and an anvil! You’re the one with the
elf’s memories. Why didn’t you tell me this was a dead end?”
Eragon bristled at the barrage and retorted, “All I knew was where we had to go, not what lay in
between. Don’t blame me for choosing to come.”
Murtagh’s breath hissed between his teeth as he furiously spun away. All Eragon could see of him was a
motionless, bowed figure. His own shoulders were tense, and a vein throbbed on the side of his neck. He
put his hands on his hips, impatience rising.
Why have you stopped?asked Saphira, alarmed.
Don’t distract me.“What’s your quarrel with the Varden? It can’t be so terrible that you must keep it
hidden even now. Would you rather fight the Kull than reveal it? How many times will we go through this
before you trust me?”
There was a long silence.
The Urgals!reminded Saphira urgently.
I know,said Eragon, pushing back his temper.But we have to resolve this.
Quickly, quickly.
“Murtagh,” said Eragon earnestly, “unless you wish to die, we must go to the Varden. Don’t let me walk
into their arms without knowing how they will react to you. It’s going to be dangerous enough without
unnecessary surprises.”
Finally Murtagh turned to Eragon. His breathing was hard and fast, like that of a cornered wolf. He
paused, then said with a tortured voice, “You have a right to know. I… I am the son of Morzan, first and
last of the Forsworn.”
THEHORNS OF ADILEMMA
Eragon was speechless. Disbelief roared through his mind as he tried to reject Murtagh’s words.The
Forsworn never had any children, least of all Morzan. Morzan! The man who betrayed the Riders to
Galbatorix and remained the king’s favorite servant for the rest of his life. Could it be true?
Saphira’s own shock reached him a second later. She crashed through trees and brush as she barreled
from the river to his side, fangs bared, tail raised threateningly.Be ready for anything, she warned.He may
be able to use magic.
“You are his heir?” asked Eragon, surreptitiously reaching for Zar’roc.What could he want with me? Is

he really working for the king?
“I didn’t choose this!” cried Murtagh, anguish twisting his face. He ripped at his clothes with a desperate
air, tearing off his tunic and shirt to bare his torso. “Look!” he pleaded, and turned his back to Eragon.
Unsure, Eragon leaned forward, straining his eyes in the darkness. There, against Murtagh’s tanned and
muscled skin, was a knotted white scar that stretched from his right shoulder to his left hip—a testament
to some terrible agony.
“See that?” demanded Murtagh bitterly. He talked quickly now, as if relieved to have his secret finally
revealed. “I was only three when I got it. During one of his many drunken rages, Morzan threw his sword
at me as I ran by. My back was laid open by the very sword you now carry—the only thing I expected
to receive as inheritance, until Brom stole it from my father’s corpse. I was lucky, I suppose—there was
a healer nearby who kept me from dying. You must understand, I don’t love the Empire or the king. I
have no allegiance to them, nor do I mean you harm!” His pleas were almost frantic.
Eragon uneasily lifted his hand from Zar’roc’s pommel. “Then your father,” he said in a faltering voice,
“was killed by…”
“Yes, Brom,” said Murtagh. He pulled his tunic back on with a detached air.
A horn rang out behind them, prompting Eragon to cry, “Come, run with me.” Murtagh shook the
horses’ reins and forced them into a tired trot, eyes fixed straight ahead, while Arya bounced limply in
Snowfire’s saddle. Saphira stayed by Eragon’s side, easily keeping pace with her long legs.You could
walk unhindered in the riverbed, he said as she was forced to smash through a dense web of branches.
I’ll not leave you with him.
Eragon was glad for her protection.Morzan’s son! He said between strides, “Your tale is hard to
believe. How do I know you aren’t lying?”
“Why would I lie?”
“You could be—”
Murtagh interrupted him quickly. “I can’t prove anything to you now. Keep your doubts until we reach
the Varden. They’ll recognize me quickly enough.”
“I must know,” pressed Eragon. “Do you serve the Empire?”
“No. And if I did, what would I accomplish by traveling with you? If I were trying to capture or kill you,
I would have left you in prison.” Murtagh stumbled as he jumped over a fallen log.
“You could be leading the Urgals to the Varden.”
“Then,” said Murtagh shortly, “why am I still with you? I know where the Varden are now. What reason
could I have for delivering myself to them? If I were going to attack them, I’d turn around and join the
Urgals.”
“Maybe you’re an assassin,” stated Eragon flatly.

Page 221

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“Maybe. You can’t really know, can you?”
Saphira?Eragon asked simply.
Her tail swished over his head.If he wanted to harm you, he could have done it long ago.
A branch whipped Eragon’s neck, causing a line of blood to appear on his skin. The waterfall was
growing louder.I want you to watch Murtagh closely when we get to the Varden. He may do something
foolish, and I don’t want him killed by accident.
I’ll do my best,she said as she shouldered her way between two trees, scraping off slabs of bark. The
horn sounded behind them again. Eragon glanced over his shoulder, expecting Urgals to rush out of the
darkness. The waterfall throbbed dully ahead of them, drowning out the sounds of the night.
The forest ended, and Murtagh pulled the horses to a stop. They were on a pebble beach directly to the
left of the mouth of the Beartooth River. The deep lake Kóstha-mérna filled the valley, blocking their
way. The water gleamed with flickering starlight. The mountain walls restricted passage around
Kóstha-mérna to a thin strip of shore on either side of the lake, both no more than a few steps wide. At
the lake’s far end, a broad sheet of water tumbled down a black cliff into boiling mounds of froth.
“Do we go to the falls?” asked Murtagh tightly.
“Yes.” Eragon took the lead and picked his way along the lake’s left side. The pebbles underfoot were
damp and slime covered. There was barely enough room for Saphira between the sheer valley wall and
the lake; she had to walk with two feet in the water.
They were halfway to the waterfall when Murtagh warned, “Urgals!”
Eragon whirled around, rocks spraying from under his heel. By the shore of Kóstha-mérna, where they
had been only minutes before, hulking figures streamed out of the forest. The Urgals massed before the
lake. One of them gestured at Saphira; guttural words drifted over the water. Immediately the horde split
and started around both sides of the lake, leaving Eragon and Murtagh without an escape route. The
narrow shore forced the bulky Kull to march single file.
“Run!” barked Murtagh, drawing his sword and slapping the horses on their flanks. Saphira took off
without warning and wheeled back toward the Urgals.
“No!” cried Eragon, shouting with his mind,Come back!but she continued, heedless to his pleas. With an
agonizing effort, he tore his gaze from her and plunged forward, wrenching Zar’roc from its sheath.
Saphira dived at the Urgals, bellowing fiercely. They tried to scatter but were trapped against the
mountainside. She caught a Kull between her talons and carried the screaming creature aloft, tearing at
him with her fangs. The silent body crashed into the lake a moment later, an arm and a leg missing.
The Kull continued around Kóstha-mérna undeterred. With smoke streaming from her nostrils, Saphira
dived at them again. She twisted and rolled as a cloud of black arrows shot toward her. Most of the
darts glanced off her scaled sides, leaving no more than bruises, but she roared as the rest pierced her
wings.
Eragon’s arms twinged with sympathetic pain, and he had to restrain himself from rushing to her defense.
Fear flooded his veins as he saw the line of Urgals closing in on them. He tried to run faster, but his

Page 222

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

muscles were too tired, the rocks too slippery.
Then, with a loud splash, Saphira plunged into Kóstha-mérna. She submerged completely, sending
ripples across the lake. The Urgals nervously eyed the dark water lapping their feet. One growled
something indecipherable and jabbed his spear at the lake.
The water exploded as Saphira’s head shot out of the depths. Her jaws closed on the spear, breaking it
like a twig as she tore it out of the Kull’s hands with a vicious twist. Before she could seize the Urgal
himself, his companions thrust at her with their spears, bloodying her nose.
Saphira jerked back and hissed angrily, beating the water with her tail. Keeping his spear pointed at her,
the lead Kull tried to edge past, but halted when she snapped at his legs. The string of Urgals was forced
to stop as she held him at bay. Meanwhile, the Kull on the other side of the lake still hurried toward the
falls.
I’ve trapped them,she told Eragon tersely,but hurry—I cannot hold them long.Archers on the shore
were already taking aim at her. Eragon concentrated on going faster, but a rock gave under his boot and
he pitched forward. Murtagh’s strong arm kept him on his feet, and clasping each other’s forearms, they
urged the horses forward with shouts.
They were almost to the waterfall. The noise was overwhelming, like an avalanche. A white wall of
water gushed down the cliff, pounding the rocks below with a fury that sent mist spraying through the air
to run down their faces. Four yards from the thunderous curtain, the beach widened, giving them room to
maneuver.
Saphira roared as an Urgal spear grazed her haunch, then retreated underwater. With her withdrawal the
Kull rushed forward with long strides. They were only a few hundred feet away. “What do we do now?”
Murtagh demanded coldly.
“I don’t know. Let me think!” cried Eragon, searching Arya’s memories for her final instructions. He
scanned the ground until he found a rock the size of an apple, grabbed it, then pounded on the cliff next
to the falls, shouting, “Aí varden abr du Shur’tugals gata vanta!”
Nothing happened.
He tried again, shouting louder than before, but only succeeded in bruising his hand. He turned in despair
to Murtagh. “We’re trap—” His words were cut off as Saphira leapt out of the lake, dousing them with
icy water. She landed on the beach and crouched, ready to fight.
The horses backpedaled wildly, trying to bolt. Eragon reached out with his mind to steady them.Behind
you! cried Saphira. He turned and glimpsed the lead Urgal running at him, heavy spear raised. Up close a
Kull was as tall as a small giant, with legs and arms as thick as tree trunks.
Murtagh drew back his arm and threw his sword with incredible speed. The long weapon revolved
once, then struck the Kull point first in the chest with a dull crunch. The huge Urgal toppled to the ground
with a strangled gurgle. Before another Kull could attack, Murtagh dashed forward and yanked his
sword out of the body.
Eragon raised his palm, shouting, “Jierda theirra kalfis!” Sharp cracks resounded off the cliff. Twenty of
the charging Urgals fell into Kóstha-mérna, howling and clutching their legs where shards of bone
protruded. Without breaking stride, the rest of the Urgals advanced over their fallen companions. Eragon

Page 223

struggled against his weariness, putting a hand on Saphira for support.
A flight of arrows, impossible to see in the darkness, brushed past them and clattered against the cliff.
Eragon and Murtagh ducked, covering their heads. With a small growl, Saphira jumped over them so
that her armored sides shielded them and the horses. A chorus of clinks sounded as a second volley of
arrows bounced off her scales.
“What now?” shouted Murtagh. There was still no opening in the cliff. “We can’t stay here!”
Eragon heard Saphira snarl as an arrow caught the edge of her wing, tearing the thin membrane. He
looked around wildly, trying to understand why Arya’s instructions had not worked. “I don’t know! This
is where we’re supposed to be!”
“Why don’t you ask the elf to make sure?” demanded Murtagh. He dropped his sword, snatched his
bow from Tornac’s saddlebags, and with a swift motion loosed an arrow from between the spikes on
Saphira’s back. A moment later an Urgal toppled into the water.
“Now? She’s barely alive! How’s she going to find the energy to say anything?”
“I don’tknow,” shouted Murtagh, “but you’d better think ofsomething because we can’t stave off an
entire army!”
Eragon,growled Saphira urgently.
What!
We’re on the wrong side of the lake! I’ve seen Arya’s memories through you, and I just realized that this
isn’t the right place.She tucked her head against her breast as another flight of arrows sped toward them.
Her tail flicked in pain as they struck her.I can’t keep this up! They’re tearing me to pieces!
Eragon slammed Zar’roc back into its sheath and exclaimed, “The Varden are on the other side of the
lake. We have to go through the waterfall!” He noted with dread that the Urgals across Kóstha-mérna
were almost to the falls.
Murtagh’s eyes shot toward the violent deluge blocking their way. “We’ll never get the horses through
there, even if we can hold our own footing.”
“I’ll convince them to follow us,” snapped Eragon. “And Saphira can carry Arya.” The Urgals’ cries and
bellows made Snowfire snort angrily. The elf lolled on his back, oblivious to the danger.
Murtagh shrugged. “It’s better than being hacked to death.” He swiftly cut Arya loose from Snowfire’s
saddle, and Eragon caught the elf as she slid to the ground.
I’m ready,said Saphira, rising into a half-crouch. The approaching Urgals hesitated, unsure of her
intentions.
“Now!” cried Eragon. He and Murtagh heaved Arya onto Saphira, then secured her legs in the saddle’s
straps. The second they were finished, Saphira swept up her wings and soared over the lake. The Urgals
behind her howled as they saw her escaping. Arrows clattered off her belly. The Kull on the other shore
redoubled their pace so as to attain the waterfall before she landed.

Eragon reached out with his mind to force himself into the frightened thoughts of the horses. Using the
ancient language, he told them that unless they swam through the waterfall, they would be killed and eaten
by the Urgals. Though they did not understand everything he said, the meaning of his words was
unmistakable.
Snowfire and Tornac tossed their heads, then dashed into the thundering downpour, whinnying as it
struck their backs. They floundered, struggling to stay above water. Murtagh sheathed his sword and
jumped after them; his head disappeared under a froth of bubbles before he bobbed up, sputtering.
The Urgals were right behind Eragon; he could hear their feet crunching on the gravel. With a fierce war
cry he leapt after Murtagh, closing his eyes a second before the cold water pummeled him.
The tremendous weight of the waterfall slammed down on his shoulders with backbreaking force. The
water’s mindless roar filled his ears. He was driven to the bottom, where his knees gouged the rocky
lakebed. He kicked off with all his strength and shot partway out of the water. Before he could take a
gulp of air, the cascade rammed him back underwater.
All he could see was a white blur as foam billowed around him. He frantically tried to surface and relieve
his burning lungs, but he only rose a few feet before the deluge halted his ascent. He panicked, thrashing
his arms and legs, fighting the water. Weighed down by Zar’roc and his drenched clothes, he sank back
to the lakebed, unable to speak the ancient words that could save him.
Suddenly a strong hand grasped the back of his tunic and dragged him through the water. His rescuer
sliced through the lake with quick, short strokes; Eragon hoped it was Murtagh, not an Urgal. They
surfaced and stumbled onto the pebble beach. Eragon was trembling violently; his entire body shivered in
bursts.
Sounds of combat erupted to his right, and he whirled toward them, expecting an Urgal attack. The
monsters on the opposite shore—where he had stood only moments before—fell beneath a withering hail
of arrows from crevasses that pockmarked the cliff. Scores of Urgals already floated belly up in the
water, riddled with shafts. The ones on Eragon’s shore were similarly engaged. Neither group could
retreat from their exposed positions, for rows of warriors had somehow appeared behind them, where
the lake met the mountainsides. All that prevented the nearest Kull from rushing Eragon was the steady
rain of arrows—the unseen archers seemed determined to keep the Urgals at bay.
A gruff voice next to Eragon said, “Akh Guntéraz dorzâda! What were they thinking? You would have
drowned!” Eragon jerked with surprise. It was not Murtagh standing by him but a diminutive man no
taller than his elbow.
The dwarf was busy wringing water out of his long braided beard. His chest was stocky, and he wore a
chain-mail jacket cut off at the shoulders to reveal muscular arms. A war ax hung from a wide leather belt
strapped around his waist. An iron-bound oxhide cap, bearing the symbol of a hammer surrounded by
twelve stars, sat firmly on his head. Even with the cap, he barely topped four feet. He looked longingly at
the fighting and said, “Barzul, but I wish I could join them!”
A dwarf!Eragon drew Zar’roc and looked for Saphira and Murtagh. Two twelve-foot-thick stone doors
had opened in the cliff, revealing a broad tunnel nearly thirty feet tall that burrowed its way into the
mysterious depths of the mountain. A line of flameless lamps filled the passageway with a pale sapphire
light that spilled out onto the lake.
Saphira and Murtagh stood before the tunnel, surrounded by a grim mixture of men and dwarves. At

Murtagh’s elbow was a bald, beardless man dressed in purple and gold robes. He was taller than all the
other humans—and he was holding a dagger to Murtagh’s throat.
Eragon reached for his power, but the robed man said in a sharp, dangerous voice, “Stop! If you use
magic, I’ll kill your lovely friend here, who was so kind as to mention you’re a Rider. Don’t think I won’t
know if you’re drawing upon it. You can’t hide anything from me.” Eragon tried to speak, but the man
snarled and pressed the dagger harder against Murtagh’s throat. “None of that! If you say or do anything
I don’t tell you to, he will die. Now, everyone inside.” He backed into the tunnel, pulling Murtagh with
him and keeping his eyes on Eragon.
Saphira, what should I do?Eragon asked quickly as the men and dwarves followed Murtagh’s captor,
leading the horses along with them.
Go with them,she counseled,and hope that we live.She entered the tunnel herself, eliciting nervous
glances from those around her. Reluctantly, Eragon followed her, aware that the warriors’ eyes were
upon him. His rescuer, the dwarf, walked alongside him with a hand on the haft of his war ax.
Utterly exhausted, Eragon staggered into the mountain. The stone doors swung shut behind them with
only a whisper of sound. He looked back and saw a seamless wall where the opening had been. They
were trapped inside. But were they any safer?
HUNTING FORANSWERS
“This way,” snapped the bald man. He stepped back, keeping the dagger pressed under Murtagh’s chin,
then wheeled to the right, disappearing through an arched doorway. The warriors cautiously followed
him, their attention centered on Eragon and Saphira. The horses were led into a different tunnel.
Dazed by the turn of events, Eragon started after Murtagh. He glanced at Saphira to confirm that Arya
was still tied to her back.She has to get the antidote! he thought frantically, knowing that even then the
Skilna Bragh was fulfilling its deadly purpose within her flesh.
He hurried through the arched doorway and down a narrow corridor after the bald man. The warriors
kept their weapons pointed at him. They swept past a sculpture of a peculiar animal with thick quills. The
corridor curved sharply to the left, then to the right. A door opened and they entered a bare room large
enough for Saphira to move around with ease. There was a hollow boom as the door closed, followed
by a loud scrape as a bolt was secured on the outside.
Eragon slowly examined his surroundings, Zar’roc tight in his hand. The walls, floor, and ceiling were
made of polished white marble that reflected a ghost image of everyone, like a mirror of veined milk. One
of the unusual lanterns hung in each corner. “There’s an injured—” he began, but a sharp gesture from
the bald man cut him off.
“Do not speak! It must wait until you have been tested.” He shoved Murtagh over to one of the
warriors, who pressed a sword against Murtagh’s neck. The bald man clasped his hands together softly.
“Remove your weapons and slide them to me.” A dwarf unbuckled Murtagh’s sword and dropped it on
the floor with a clank.
Loath to be parted with Zar’roc, Eragon unfastened the sheath and set it and the blade on the floor. He
placed his bow and quiver next to them, then pushed the pile toward the warriors. “Now step away from
your dragon and slowly approach me,” commanded the bald man.

Puzzled, Eragon moved forward. When they were a yard apart, the man said, “Stop there! Now remove
the defenses from around your mind and prepare to let me inspect your thoughts and memories. If you try
to hide anything from me, I will take what I want by force… which would drive you mad. If you don’t
submit, your companion will be killed.”
“Why?” asked Eragon, aghast.
“To be sure you aren’t in Galbatorix’s service and to understand why hundreds of Urgals are banging on
our front door,” growled the bald man. His close-set eyes shifted from point to point with cunning speed.
“No one may enter Farthen Dûr without being tested.”
“There isn’t time. We need a healer!” protested Eragon.
“Silence!” roared the man, pressing down his robe with thin fingers. “Until you are examined, your
words are meaningless!”
“But she’s dying!” retorted Eragon angrily, pointing at Arya. They were in a precarious position, but he
would let nothing else happen until Arya was cared for.
“It will have to wait! No one will leave this room until we have discovered the truth of this matter. Unless
you wish—”
The dwarf who had saved Eragon from the lake jumped forward. “Are you blind, Egraz Carn? Can’t
you see that’s an elf on the dragon? We cannot keep her here if she’s in danger. Ajihad and the king will
have our heads if she’s allowed to die!”
The man’s eyes tightened with anger. After a moment he relaxed and said smoothly, “Of course, Orik,
we wouldn’t want that to happen.” He snapped his fingers and pointed at Arya. “Remove her from the
dragon.” Two human warriors sheathed their swords and hesitantly approached Saphira, who watched
them steadily. “Quickly, quickly!”
The men unstrapped Arya from the saddle and lowered the elf to the floor. One of the men inspected
her face, then said sharply, “It’s the dragon-egg courier, Arya!”
“What?” exclaimed the bald man. The dwarf Orik’s eyes widened with astonishment. The bald man
fixed his steely gaze on Eragon and said flatly, “You have much explaining to do.”
Eragon returned the intense stare with all the determination he could muster. “She was poisoned with the
Skilna Bragh while in prison. Only Túnivor’s Nectar can save her now.”
The bald man’s face became inscrutable. He stood motionless, except for his lips, which twitched
occasionally. “Very well. Take her to the healers, and tell them what she needs. Guard her until the
ceremony is completed. I will have new orders for you by then.” The warriors nodded curtly and carried
Arya out of the room. Eragon watched them go, wishing that he could accompany her. His attention
snapped back to the bald man as he said, “Enough of this, we have wasted too much time already.
Prepare to be examined.”
Eragon did not want this hairless threatening man inside his mind, laying bare his every thought and
feeling, but he knew that resistance would be useless. The air was strained. Murtagh’s gaze burned into
his forehead. Finally he bowed his head. “I am ready.”

Page 227

“Good, then—”
He was interrupted as Orik said abruptly, “You’d better not harm him, Egraz Carn, else the king will
have words for you.”
The bald man looked at him irritably, then faced Eragon with a small smile. “Only if he resists.” He
bowed his head and chanted several inaudible words.
Eragon gasped with pain and shock as a mental probe clawed its way into his mind. His eyes rolled up
into his head, and he automatically began throwing up barriers around his consciousness. The attack was
incredibly powerful.
Don’t do that!cried Saphira. Her thoughts joined his, filling him with strength.You’re putting Murtagh at
risk! Eragon faltered, gritted his teeth, then forced himself to remove his shielding, exposing himself to the
ravening probe. Disappointment emanated from the bald man. His battering intensified. The force coming
from his mind felt decayed and unwholesome; there was something profoundly wrong about it.
He wants me to fight him!cried Eragon as a fresh wave of pain racked him. A second later it subsided,
only to be replaced by another. Saphira did her best to suppress it, but even she could not block it
entirely.
Give him what he wants,she said quickly,but protect everything else. I’ll help you. His strength is no
match for mine; I’m already shielding our words from him.
Then why does it still hurt?
The pain comes from you.
Eragon winced as the probe dug in farther, hunting for information, like a nail being driven through his
skull. The bald man roughly seized his childhood memories and began sifting through them.He doesn’t
need those—get him out of there! growled Eragon angrily.
I can’t, not without endangering you,said Saphira.I can conceal things from his view, but it must be done
before he reaches them. Think quickly, and tell me what you want hidden!
Eragon tried to concentrate through the pain. He raced through his memories, starting from when he had
found Saphira’s egg. He hid sections of his discussions with Brom, including all the ancient words he had
been taught. Their travels through Palancar Valley, Yazuac, Daret, and Teirm he left mostly untouched.
But he had Saphira conceal everything he remembered of Angela’s fortunetelling and Solembum. He
skipped from their burglary at Teirm, to Brom’s death, to his imprisonment in Gil’ead, and lastly to
Murtagh’s revelation of his true identity.
Eragon wanted to hide that as well, but Saphira balked.The Varden have a right to know who they
shelter under their roof, especially if it’s a son of the Forsworn!
Just do it,he said tightly, fighting another wave of agony.I won’t be the one to unmask him, at least not to
this man.
It’ll be discovered as soon as Murtagh is scanned,warned Saphira sharply.
Just do it.

With the most important information hidden, there was nothing else for Eragon to do but wait for the
bald man to finish his inspection. It was like sitting still while his fingernails were extracted with rusty
tongs. His entire body was rigid, jaw locked tightly. Heat radiated from his skin, and a line of sweat
rolled down his neck. He was acutely aware of each second as the long minutes crept by.
The bald man wound through his experiences sluggishly, like a thorny vine pushing its way toward the
sunlight. He paid keen attention to many things Eragon considered irrelevant, such as his mother, Selena,
and seemed to linger on purpose so as to prolong the suffering. He spent a long time examining Eragon’s
recollections of the Ra’zac, and then later the Shade. It was not until his adventures had been
exhaustively analyzed that the bald man began to withdraw from Eragon’s mind.
The probe was extracted like a splinter being removed. Eragon shuddered, swayed, then fell toward the
floor. Strong arms caught him at the last second, lowering him to the cool marble. He heard Orik exclaim
from behind him, “You went too far! He wasn’t strong enough for this.”
“He’ll live. That’s all that is needed,” answered the bald man curtly.
There was an angry grunt. “What did you find?”
Silence.
“Well, is he to be trusted or not?”
The words came reluctantly. “He… is not your enemy.” There were audible sighs of relief throughout the
room.
Eragon’s eyes fluttered open. He gingerly pushed himself upright. “Easy now,” said Orik, wrapping a
thick arm around him and helping him to his feet. Eragon wove unsteadily, glaring at the bald man. A low
growl rumbled in Saphira’s throat.
The bald man ignored them. He turned to Murtagh, who was still being held at sword point. “It’s your
turn now.”
Murtagh stiffened and shook his head. The sword cut his neck slightly. Blood dripped down his skin.
“No.”
“You will not be protected here if you refuse.”
“Eragon has been declared trustworthy, so you cannot threaten to kill him to influence me. Since you
can’t do that, nothing you say or do will convince me to open my mind.”
Sneering, the bald man cocked what would have been an eyebrow, if he had any. “What of your own
life? I can still threaten that.”
“It won’t do any good,” said Murtagh stonily and with such conviction that it was impossible to doubt his
word.
The bald man’s breath exploded angrily. “You don’t have a choice!” He stepped forward and placed his
palm on Murtagh’s brow, clenching his hand to hold him in place. Murtagh stiffened, face growing as
hard as iron, fists clenched, neck muscles bulging. He was obviously fighting the attack with all his

Page 229

strength. The bald man bared his teeth with fury and frustration at the resistance; his fingers dug
mercilessly into Murtagh.
Eragon winced in sympathy, knowing the battle that raged between them.Can’t you help him? he asked
Saphira.
No,she said softly.He will allow no one into his mind.
Orik scowled darkly as he watched the combatants. “Ilf carnz orodüm,” he muttered, then leapt forward
and cried, “That is enough!” He grabbed the bald man’s arm and tore him away from Murtagh with
strength disproportional to his size.
The bald man stumbled back, then turned on Orik furiously. “How dare you!” he shouted. “You
questioned my leadership, opened the gates without permission, and now this! You’ve shown nothing but
insolence and treachery. Do you think your king will protect you now?”
Orik bristled. “You would have let them die! If I had waited any longer, the Urgals would have killed
them.” He pointed at Murtagh, whose breath came in great heaves. “We don’t have any right to torture
him for information! Ajihad won’t sanction it. Not after you’ve examined the Rider and found him free of
fault.And they’ve brought us Arya.”
“Would you allow him to enter unchallenged? Are you so great a fool as to put us all at risk?” demanded
the bald man. His eyes were feral with loosely chained rage; he looked ready to tear the dwarf into
pieces.
“Can he use magic?”
“That is—”
“Can he use magic?” roared Orik, his deep voice echoing in the room. The bald man’s face suddenly
grew expressionless. He clasped his hands behind his back.
“No.”
“Then what do you fear? It’s impossible for him to escape, and he can’t work any devilry with all of us
here, especially if your powers are as great as you say. But don’t listen to me; ask Ajihad what he wants
done.”
The bald man stared at Orik for a moment, his face indecipherable, then looked at the ceiling and closed
his eyes. A peculiar stiffness set into his shoulders while his lips moved soundlessly. An intense frown
wrinkled the pale skin above his eyes, and his fingers clenched, as if they were throttling an invisible
enemy. For several minutes he stood thus, wrapped in silent communication.
When his eyes opened, he ignored Orik and snapped at the warriors, “Leave, now!” As they filed
through the doorway, he addressed Eragon coldly, “Because I was unable to complete my examination,
you and… your friend will remain here for the night. He will be killed if he attempts to leave.” With those
words he turned on his heel and stalked out of the room, pale scalp gleaming in the lantern light.
“Thank you,” whispered Eragon to Orik.
The dwarf grunted. “I’ll make sure some food is brought.” He muttered a string of words under his

breath, then left, shaking his head. The bolt was secured once again on the outside of the door.
Eragon sat, feeling strangely dreamy from the day’s excitement and their forced march. His eyelids were
heavy. Saphira settled next to him.We must be careful. It seems we have as many enemies here as we
did in the Empire. He nodded, too tired to talk.
Murtagh, eyes glazed and empty, leaned against the far wall and slid to the shiny floor. He held his sleeve
against the cut on his neck to stop the bleeding. “Are you all right?” asked Eragon. Murtagh nodded
jerkily. “Did he get anything from you?”
“No.”
“How were you able to keep him out? He’s so strong.”
“I’ve… I’ve been well trained.” There was a bitter note to his voice.
Silence enshrouded them. Eragon’s gaze drifted to one of the lanterns hanging in a corner. His thoughts
meandered until he abruptly said, “I didn’t let them know who you are.”
Murtagh looked relieved. He bowed his head. “Thank you for not betraying me.”
“They didn’t recognize you.”
“No.”
“And you still say that you are Morzan’s son?”
“Yes,” he sighed.
Eragon started to speak, but stopped when he felt hot liquid splash onto his hand. He looked down and
was startled to see a drop of dark blood roll off his skin. It had fallen from Saphira’s wing.I forgot.
You’re injured! he exclaimed, getting up with an effort.I’d better heal you.
Be careful. It’s easy to make mistakes when you’re this tired.
I know.Saphira unfolded one of her wings and lowered it to the floor. Murtagh watched as Eragon ran
his hands over the warm blue membrane, saying, “Waíse heill,” whenever he found an arrow hole.
Luckily, all the wounds were relatively easy to heal, even those on her nose.
Task completed, Eragon slumped against Saphira, breathing hard. He could feel her great heart beating
with the steady throb of life. “I hope they bring food soon,” said Murtagh.
Eragon shrugged; he was too exhausted to be hungry. He crossed his arms, missing Zar’roc’s weight by
his side. “Why are you here?”
“What?”
“If you really are Morzan’s son, Galbatorix wouldn’t let you wander around Alagaësia freely. How is it
that you managed to find the Ra’zac by yourself? Why is it I’ve never heard of any of the Forsworn
having children? And what are you doing here?” His voice rose to a near shout at the end.

Page 231

Murtagh ran his hands over his face. “It’s a long story.”
“We’re not going anywhere,” rebutted Eragon.
“It’s too late to talk.”
“There probably won’t be time for it tomorrow.”
Murtagh wrapped his arms around his legs and rested his chin on his knees, rocking back and forth as
he stared at the floor. “It’s not a—” he said, then interrupted himself. “I don’t want to stop… so make
yourself comfortable. My story will take a while.” Eragon shifted against Saphira’s side and nodded.
Saphira watched both of them intently.
Murtagh’s first sentence was halting, but his voice gained strength and confidence as he spoke. “As far
as I know… I am the only child of the Thirteen Servants, or the Forsworn as they’re called. There may
be others, for the Thirteen had the skill to hide whatever they wanted, but I doubt it, for reasons I’ll
explain later.
“My parents met in a small village—I never learned where—while my father was traveling on the king’s
business. Morzan showed my mother some small kindness, no doubt a ploy to gain her confidence, and
when he left, she accompanied him. They traveled together for a time, and as is the nature of these things,
she fell deeply in love with him. Morzan was delighted to discover this not only because it gave him
numerous opportunities to torment her but also because he recognized the advantage of having a servant
who wouldn’t betray him.
“Thus, when Morzan returned to Galbatorix’s court, my mother became the tool he relied upon most.
He used her to carry his secret messages, and he taught her rudimentary magic, which helped her remain
undiscovered and, on occasion, extract information from people. He did his best to protect her from the
rest of the Thirteen—not out of any feelings for her, but because they would have used her against him,
given the chance… For three years things proceeded in this manner, until my mother became pregnant.”
Murtagh paused for a moment, fingering a lock of his hair. He continued in a clipped tone, “My father
was, if nothing else, a cunning man. He knew that the pregnancy put both him and my mother in danger,
not to mention the baby—that is, me. So, in the dead of night, he spirited her away from the palace and
took her to his castle. Once there, he laid down powerful spells that prevented anyone from entering his
estate except for a few chosen servants. In this way the pregnancy was kept secret from everyone but
Galbatorix.
“Galbatorix knew the intimate details of the Thirteen’s lives: their plots, their fights—and most
importantly—their thoughts. He enjoyed watching them battle each other and often helped one or the
other for his own amusement. But for some reason he never revealed my existence.
“I was born in due time and given to a wet nurse so my mother could return to Morzan’s side. She had
no choice in the matter. Morzan allowed her to visit me every few months, but otherwise we were kept
apart. Another three years passed like this, during which time he gave me the… scar on my back.”
Murtagh brooded a minute before continuing.
“I would have grown to manhood in this fashion if Morzan hadn’t been summoned away to hunt for
Saphira’s egg. As soon as he departed, my mother, who had been left behind, vanished. No one knows
where she went, or why. The king tried to hunt her down, but his men couldn’t find her trail—no doubt
because of Morzan’s training.

Page 232

“At the time of my birth, only five of the Thirteen were still alive. By the time Morzan left, that number
had been reduced to three; when he finally faced Brom in Gil’ead, he was the only one remaining. The
Forsworn died through various means: suicide, ambush, overuse of magic… but it was mostly the work
of the Varden. I’m told that the king was in a terrible rage because of those losses.
“However, before word of Morzan’s and the others’ deaths reached us, my mother returned. Many
months had passed since she had disappeared. Her health was poor, as if she had suffered a great illness,
and she grew steadily worse. Within a fortnight, she died.”
“What happened then?” prompted Eragon.
Murtagh shrugged. “I grew up. The king brought me to the palace and arranged for my upbringing.
Aside from that, he left me alone.”
“Then why did you leave?”
A hard laugh broke from Murtagh. “Escaped is more like it. At my last birthday, when I turned eighteen,
the king summoned me to his quarters for a private dinner. The message surprised me because I had
always distanced myself from the court and had rarely met him. We’d talked before, but always within
earshot of eavesdropping nobles.
“I accepted the offer, of course, aware that it would be unwise to refuse. The meal was sumptuous, but
throughout it his black eyes never left me. His gaze was disconcerting; it seemed that he was searching
for something hidden in my face. I didn’t know what to make of it and did my best to provide polite
conversation, but he refused to talk, and I soon ceased my efforts.
“When the meal was finished, he finally began to speak. You’ve never heard his voice, so it’s hard for
me to make you understand what it was like. His words were entrancing, like a snake whispering gilded
lies into my ears. A more convincing and frightening man I’ve never heard. He wove a vision: a fantasy of
the Empire as he imagined it. There would be beautiful cities built across the country, filled with the
greatest warriors, artisans, musicians, and philosophers. The Urgals would finally be eradicated. And the
Empire would expand in every direction until it reached the four corners of Alagaësia. Peace and
prosperity would flourish, but more wondrous yet, the Riders would be brought back to gently govern
over Galbatorix’s fiefdoms.
“Entranced, I listened to him for what must have been hours. When he stopped, I eagerly asked how the
Riders would be reinstated, for everyone knew there were no dragon eggs left. Galbatorix grew still then
and stared at me thoughtfully. For a long time he was silent, but then he extended his hand and asked,
‘Will you, O son of my friend, serve me as I labor to bring about this paradise?’
“Though I knew the history behind his and my father’s rise to power, the dream he had painted for me
was too compelling, too seductive to ignore. Ardor for this mission filled me, and I fervently pledged
myself to him. Obviously pleased, Galbatorix gave me his blessing, then dismissed me, saying, ‘I shall call
upon you when the need arises.’
“Several months passed before he did. When the summons came, I felt all of my old excitement return.
We met in private as before, but this time he was not pleasant or charming. The Varden had just
destroyed three brigades in the south, and his wrath was out in full force. He charged me in a terrible
voice to take a detachment of troops and destroy Cantos, where rebels were known to hide
occasionally. When I asked what we should do with the people there and how we would know if they

Page 233

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

were guilty, he shouted, ‘They’re all traitors! Burn them at the stake and bury their ashes with dung!’ He
continued to rant, cursing his enemies and describing how he would scourge the land of everyone who
bore him ill will.
“His tone was so different from what I had encountered before; it made me realize he didn’t possess the
mercy or foresight to gain the people’s loyalty, and he ruled only through brute force guided by his own
passions. It was at that moment I determined to escape him and Urû’baen forever.
“As soon as I was free of his presence, I and my faithful servant, Tornac, made ready for flight. We left
that very night, but somehow Galbatorix anticipated my actions, for there were soldiers waiting for us
outside the gates. Ah, my sword was bloody, flashing in the dim lantern glow. We defeated the men…
but in the process Tornac was killed.
“Alone and filled with grief, I fled to an old friend who sheltered me in his estate. While I hid, I listened
carefully to every rumor, trying to predict Galbatorix’s actions and plan my future. During that time, talk
reached me that the Ra’zac had been sent to capture or kill someone. Remembering the king’s plans for
the Riders, I decided to find and follow the Ra’zac, just in case theydid discover a dragon. And that’s
how I found you… I have no more secrets.”
We still don’t know if he’s telling the truth,warned Saphira.
I know,said Eragon,but why would he lie to us?
He might be mad.
I doubt it.Eragon ran a finger over Saphira’s hard scales, watching the light reflect off them. “So why
don’t you join the Varden? They’ll distrust you for a time, but once you prove your loyalty they’ll treat
you with respect. And aren’t they in a sense your allies? They strive to end the king’s reign. Isn’t that
what you want?”
“Must I spell everything out for you?” demanded Murtagh. “I don’t want Galbatorix to learn where I am,
which is inevitable if people start saying that I’ve sided with his enemies, which I’ve never done. These,”
he paused, then said with distaste, “rebelsare trying not only to overthrow the king but to destroy the
Empire… and I don’t want that to happen. It would sow mayhem and anarchy. The king is flawed, yes,
but the system itself is sound. As for earning the Varden’s respect: Ha! Once I am exposed, they’ll treat
me like a criminal or worse. Not only that, suspicion will fall upon you because we traveled together!”
He’s right,said Saphira.
Eragon ignored her. “It isn’t that bad,” he said, trying to sound optimistic. Murtagh snorted derisively
and looked away. “I’m sure that they won’t be—” His words were cut short as the door opened a
hand’s breadth and two bowls were pushed through the space. A loaf of bread and a hunk of raw meat
followed, then the door was shut again.
“Finally!” grumbled Murtagh, going to the food. He tossed the meat to Saphira, who snapped it out of
the air and swallowed it whole. Then he tore the loaf in two, gave half to Eragon, picked up his bowl, and
retreated to a corner.
They ate silently. Murtagh jabbed at his food. “I’m going to sleep,” he announced, putting down his bowl
without another word.

“Good night,” said Eragon. He lay next to Saphira, his arms under his head. She curled her long neck
around him, like a cat wrapping its tail around itself, and laid her head alongside his. One of her wings
extended over him like a blue tent, enveloping him in darkness.
Good night, little one.
A small smile lifted Eragon’s lips, but he was already asleep.
THEGLORY OFTRONJHEIM
Eragon jolted upright as a growl sounded in his ear. Saphira was still asleep, her eyes wandering
sightlessly under her eyelids, and her upper lip trembled, as if she were going to snarl. He smiled, then
jerked as she growled again.
She must be dreaming,he realized. He watched her for a minute, then carefully slid out from under her
wing. He stood and stretched. The room was cool, but not unpleasantly so. Murtagh lay on his back in
the far corner, his eyes closed.
As Eragon stepped around Saphira, Murtagh stirred. “Morning,” he said quietly, sitting up.
“How long have you been awake?” asked Eragon in a hushed voice.
“Awhile. I’m surprised Saphira didn’t wake you sooner.”
“I was tired enough to sleep through a thunderstorm,” said Eragon wryly. He sat by Murtagh and rested
his head against the wall. “Do you know what time it is?”
“No. It’s impossible to tell in here.”
“Has anyone come to see us?”
“Not yet.”
They sat together without moving or speaking. Eragon felt oddly bound to Murtagh.I’ve been carrying
his father’s sword, which would have been his… his inheritance. We’re alike in many ways, yet our
outlook and upbringing are totally different. He thought of Murtagh’s scar and shivered.What man could
do that to a child?
Saphira lifted her head and blinked to clear her eyes. She sniffed the air, then yawned expansively, her
rough tongue curling at the tip.Has anything happened? Eragon shook his head.I hope they give me more
food than that snack last night. I’m hungry enough to eat a herd of cows.
They’ll feed you,he assured her.
They’d better.She positioned herself near the door and settled down to wait, tail flicking. Eragon closed
his eyes, enjoying the rest. He dozed awhile, then got up and paced around. Bored, he examined one of
the lanterns. It was made of a single piece of teardrop-shaped glass, about twice the size of a lemon, and
filled with soft blue light that neither wavered nor flickered. Four slim metal ribs wrapped smoothly
around the glass, meeting at the top to form a small hook and again at the bottom where they melded
together into three graceful legs. The whole piece was quite attractive.

Eragon’s inspection was interrupted by voices outside the room. The door opened, and a dozen
warriors marched inside. The first man gulped when he saw Saphira. They were followed by Orik and
the bald man, who declared, “You have been summoned to Ajihad, leader of the Varden. If you must
eat, do so while we march.” Eragon and Murtagh stood together, watching him warily.
“Where are our horses? And can I have my sword and bow back?” asked Eragon.
The bald man looked at him with disdain. “Your weapons will be returned to you when Ajihad sees fit,
not before. As for your horses, they await you in the tunnel. Now come!”
As he turned to leave, Eragon asked quickly, “How is Arya?”
The bald man hesitated. “I do not know. The healers are still with her.” He exited the room,
accompanied by Orik.
One of the warriors motioned. “You go first.” Eragon went through the doorway, followed by Saphira
and Murtagh. They returned through the corridor they had traversed the night before, passing the statue
of the quilled animal. When they reached the huge tunnel through which they had first entered the
mountain, the bald man was waiting with Orik, who held Tornac’s and Snowfire’s reins.
“You will ride single file down the center of the tunnel,” instructed the bald man. “If you attempt to go
anywhere else, you will be stopped.” When Eragon started to climb onto Saphira, the bald man shouted,
“No! Ride your horse until I tell you otherwise.”
Eragon shrugged and took Snowfire’s reins. He swung into the saddle, guided Snowfire in front of
Saphira, and told her,Stay close in case I need your help.
Of course,she said.
Murtagh mounted Tornac behind Saphira. The bald man examined their small line, then gestured at the
warriors, who divided in half to surround them, giving Saphira as wide a berth as possible. Orik and the
bald man went to the head of the procession.
After looking them over once more, the bald man clapped twice and started walking forward. Eragon
tapped Snowfire lightly on his flanks. The entire group headed toward the heart of the mountain. Echoes
filled the tunnel as the horses’ hooves struck the hard floor, the sounds amplified in the deserted
passageway. Doors and gates occasionally disturbed the smooth walls, but they were always closed.
Eragon marveled at the sheer size of the tunnel, which had been mined with incredible skill—the walls,
floor, and ceiling were crafted with flawless precision. The angles at the bases of the walls were perfectly
square, and as far as he could tell, the tunnel itself did not vary from its course by even an inch.
As they proceeded, Eragon’s anticipation about meeting Ajihad increased. The leader of the Varden
was a shadowy figure to the people within the Empire. He had risen to power nearly twenty years ago
and since then had waged a fierce war against King Galbatorix. No one knew where he came from or
even what he looked like. It was rumored that he was a master strategist, a brutal fighter. With such a
reputation, Eragon worried about how they would be received. Still, knowing that Brom had trusted the
Varden enough to serve them helped to allay his fears.
Seeing Orik again had brought forth new questions in his mind. The tunnel was obviously dwarf
work—no one else could mine with such skill—but were the dwarves part of the Varden, or were they

Page 236

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

merely sheltering them? And who was the king that Orik had mentioned? Was it Ajihad? Eragon
understood now that the Varden had been able to escape discovery by hiding underground, but what
about the elves? Where were they?
For nearly an hour the bald man led them through the tunnel, never straying nor turning.We’ve probably
already gone a league, Eragon realized.Maybe they’re taking us all the way through the mountain! At last
a soft white glow became visible ahead of them. He strained his eyes, trying to discern its source, but it
was still too far away to make out any details. The glow increased in strength as they neared it.
Now he could see thick marble pillars laced with rubies and amethysts standing in rows along the walls.
Scores of lanterns hung between the pillars, suffusing the air with liquid brilliance. Gold tracery gleamed
from the pillars’ bases like molten thread. Arching over the ceiling were carved raven heads, their beaks
open in mid-screech. At the end of the hallway rested two colossal black doors, accented by shimmering
silver lines that depicted a seven-pointed crown that spanned both sides.
The bald man stopped and raised a hand. He turned to Eragon. “You will ride upon your dragon now.
Do not attempt to fly away. There will be people watching, so remember who and what you are.”
Eragon dismounted Snowfire, and then clambered onto Saphira’s back.I think they want to show us off,
she said as he settled into the saddle.
We’ll see. I wish I had Zar’roc,he replied, tightening the straps around his legs.
It might be better that you aren’t wearing Morzan’s sword when the Varden first see you.
True.“I’m ready,” Eragon said, squaring his shoulders.
“Good,” said the bald man. He and Orik retreated to either side of Saphira, staying far enough back so
she was clearly in the lead. “Now walk to the doors, and once they open, follow the path. Go slowly.”
Ready?asked Eragon.
Of course.Saphira approached the doors at a measured pace. Her scales sparkled in the light, sending
glints of color dancing over the pillars. Eragon took a deep breath to steady his nerves.
Without warning, the doors swung outward on hidden joints. As the rift widened between them, rays of
sunlight streamed into the tunnel, falling on Saphira and Eragon. Temporarily blinded, Eragon blinked and
squinted. When his eyes adjusted to the light, he gasped.
They were inside a massive volcanic crater. Its walls narrowed to a small ragged opening so high above
that Eragon could not judge the distance—it might have been more than a dozen miles. A soft beam of
light fell through the aperture, illuminating the crater’s center, though it left the rest of the cavernous
expanse in hushed twilight.
The crater’s far side, hazy blue in the distance, looked to be nearly ten miles away. Giant icicles
hundreds of feet thick and thousands of feet long hung leagues above them like glistening daggers. Eragon
knew from his experience in the valley that no one, not even Saphira, could reach those lofty points.
Farther down the crater’s inner walls, dark mats of moss and lichen covered the rock.
He lowered his gaze and saw a wide cobblestone path extending from the doors’ threshold. The path
ran straight to the center of the crater, where it ended at the base of a snowy-white mountain that

Page 237

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

glittered like an uncut gem with thousands of colored lights. It was less than a tenth of the height of the
crater that loomed over and around it, but its diminutive appearance was deceiving, for it was slightly
higher than a mile.
Long as it was, the tunnel had only taken them through one side of the crater wall. As Eragon stared, he
heard Orik say deeply, “Look well, human, for no Rider has set eyes upon this for nigh over a hundred
years. The airy peak under which we stand is Farthen Dûr—discovered thousands of years ago by the
father of our race, Korgan, while he tunneled for gold. And in the center stands our greatest achievement:
Tronjheim, the city-mountain built from the purest marble.” The doors grated to a halt.
A city!
Then Eragon saw the crowd. He had been so engrossed by the sights that he had failed to notice a
dense sea of people clustered around the tunnel’s entrance. They lined the cobblestone
pathway—dwarves and humans packed together like trees in a thicket. There were hundreds…
thousands of them. Every eye, every face was focused on Eragon. And every one of them was silent.
Eragon gripped the base of one of Saphira’s neck spikes. He saw children in dirty smocks, hardy men
with scarred knuckles, women in homespun dresses, and stout, weathered dwarves who fingered their
beards. All of them bore the same taut expression—that of an injured animal when a predator is nearby
and escape is impossible.
A bead of sweat rolled down Eragon’s face, but he dared not move to wipe it away.What should I do?
he asked frantically.
Smile, raise your hand, anything!replied Saphira sharply.
Eragon tried to force out a smile, but his lips only twitched. Gathering his courage, he pushed a hand into
the air, jerking it in a little wave. When nothing happened, he flushed with embarrassment, lowered his
arm, and ducked his head.
A single cheer broke the silence. Someone clapped loudly. For a brief second the crowd hesitated, then
a wild roar swept through it, and a wave of sound crashed over Eragon.
“Very good,” said the bald man from behind him. “Now start walking.”
Relieved, Eragon sat straighter and playfully asked Saphira,Shall we go?She arched her neck and
stepped forward. As they passed the first row of people, she glanced to each side and exhaled a puff of
smoke. The crowd quieted and shrank back, then resumed cheering, their enthusiasm only intensified.
Show-off,chided Eragon. Saphira flicked her tail and ignored him. He stared curiously at the jostling
crowd as she proceeded along the path. Dwarves greatly outnumbered humans… and many of them
glared at him resentfully. Some even turned their backs and walked away with stony faces.
The humans were hard, tough people. All the men had daggers or knives at their waists; many were
armed for war. The women carried themselves proudly, but they seemed to conceal a deep-abiding
weariness. The few children and babies stared at Eragon with large eyes. He felt certain that these people
had experienced much hardship and that they would do whatever was necessary to defend themselves.
The Varden had found the perfect hiding place. Farthen Dûr’s walls were too high for a dragon to fly
over, and no army could break through the entranceway, even if it managed to find the hidden doors.

Page 238

The crowd followed close behind them, giving Saphira plenty of room. Gradually the people quieted,
though their attention remained on Eragon. He looked back and saw Murtagh riding stiffly, his face pale.
They neared the city-mountain, and Eragon saw that the white marble of Tronjheim was highly polished
and shaped into flowing contours, as if it had been poured into place. It was dotted with countless round
windows framed by elaborate carvings. A colored lantern hung in each window, casting a soft glow on
the surrounding rock. No turrets or smokestacks were visible. Directly ahead, two thirty-foot-high gold
griffins guarded a massive timber gate—recessed twenty yards into the base of Tronjheim—which was
shadowed by thick trusses that supported an arched vault far overhead.
When they reached Tronjheim’s base, Saphira paused to see if the bald man had any instructions. When
none were forthcoming, she continued to the gate. The walls were lined with fluted pillars of blood-red
jasper. Between the pillars hulked statues of outlandish creatures, captured forever by the sculptor’s
chisel.
The heavy gate rumbled open before them as hidden chains slowly raised the mammoth beams. A
four-story-high passageway extended straight toward the center of Tronjheim. The top three levels were
pierced by rows of archways that revealed gray tunnels curving off into the distance. Clumps of people
filled the arches, eagerly watching Eragon and Saphira. On ground level, however, the archways were
barred by stout doors. Rich tapestries hung between the different levels, embroidered with heroic figures
and tumultuous battle scenes.
A cheer rang in their ears as Saphira stepped into the hall and paraded down it. Eragon raised his hand,
eliciting another roar from the throng, though many of the dwarves did not join the welcoming shout.
The mile-long hall ended in an arch flanked by black onyx pillars. Yellow zircons three times the size of a
man capped the dark columns, coruscating piercing gold beams along the hall. Saphira stepped through
the opening, then stopped and craned back her neck, humming deeply in her chest.
They were in a circular room, perhaps a thousand feet across, that reached up to Tronjheim’s peak a
mile overhead, narrowing as it rose. The walls were lined with arches—one row for each level of the
city-mountain—and the floor was made of polished carnelian, upon which was etched a hammer girdled
by twelve silver pentacles, like on Orik’s helm.
The room was a nexus for four hallways—including the one they had just exited—that divided Tronjheim
into quarters. The halls were identical except for the one opposite Eragon. To the right and left of that hall
were tall arches that opened to descending stairs, which mirrored each other as they curved
underground.
The ceiling was capped by a dawn-red star sapphire of monstrous size. The jewel was twenty yards
across and nearly as thick. Its face had been carved to resemble a rose in full bloom, and so skilled was
the craftsmanship, the flower almost seemed to be real. A wide belt of lanterns wrapped around the edge
of the sapphire, which cast striated bands of blushing light over everything below. The flashing rays of the
star within the gem made it appear as if a giant eye gazed down at them.
Eragon could only gape with wonder. Nothing had prepared him for this. It seemed impossible that
Tronjheim had been built by mortal beings. The city-mountain shamed everything he had seen in the
Empire. He doubted if even Urû’baen could match the wealth and grandeur displayed here. Tronjheim
was a stunning monument to the dwarves’ power and perseverance.

The bald man walked in front of Saphira and said, “You must go on foot from here.” There was
scattered booing from the crowd as he spoke. A dwarf took Tornac and Snowfire away. Eragon
dismounted Saphira but stayed by her side as the bald man led them across the carnelian floor to the
right-hand hallway.
They followed it for several hundred feet, then entered a smaller corridor. Their guards remained despite
the cramped space. After four sharp turns, they came to a massive cedar door, stained black with age.
The bald man pulled it open and conducted everyone but the guards inside.
AJIHAD
Eragon entered an elegant, two-story study paneled with rows of cedar bookshelves. A wrought-iron
staircase wound up to a small balcony with two chairs and a reading table. White lanterns hung along the
walls and ceiling so a book could be read anywhere in the room. The stone floor was covered by an
intricate oval rug. At the far end of the room, a man stood behind a large walnut desk.
His skin gleamed the color of oiled ebony. The dome of his head was shaved bare, but a closely
trimmed black beard covered his chin and upper lip. Strong features shadowed his face, and grave,
intelligent eyes lurked under his brow. His shoulders were broad and powerful, emphasized by a tapered
red vest embroidered with gold thread and clasped over a rich purple shirt. He bore himself with great
dignity, exuding an intense, commanding air.
When he spoke, his voice was strong, confident: “Welcome to Tronjheim, Eragon and Saphira. I am
Ajihad. Please, seat yourselves.”
Eragon slipped into an armchair next to Murtagh, while Saphira settled protectively behind them. Ajihad
raised his hand and snapped his fingers. A man stepped out from behind the staircase. He was identical
to the bald man beside him. Eragon stared at the two of them with surprise, and Murtagh stiffened. “Your
confusion is understandable; they are twin brothers,” said Ajihad with a small smile. “I would tell you their
names, but they have none.”
Saphira hissed with distaste. Ajihad watched her for a moment, then sat in a high-backed chair behind
the desk. The Twins retreated under the stairs and stood impassively beside each other. Ajihad pressed
his fingers together as he stared at Eragon and Murtagh. He studied them for a long time with an
unwavering gaze.
Eragon squirmed, uncomfortable. After what seemed like several minutes, Ajihad lowered his hands and
beckoned to the Twins. One of them hurried to his side. Ajihad whispered in his ear. The bald man
suddenly paled and shook his head vigorously. Ajihad frowned, then nodded as if something had been
confirmed.
He looked at Murtagh. “You have placed me in a difficult position by refusing to be examined. You have
been allowed into Farthen Dûr because the Twins have assured me that they can control you and
because of your actions on behalf of Eragon and Arya. I understand that there may be things you wish to
keep hidden in your mind, but as long as you do, we cannot trust you.”
“You wouldn’t trust me anyway,” said Murtagh defiantly.
Ajihad’s face darkened as Murtagh spoke, and his eyes flashed dangerously. “Though it’s been twenty
and three years since it last broke upon my ear… I know that voice.” He stood ominously, chest
swelling. The Twins looked alarmed and put their heads together, whispering frantically. “It came from

Page 240

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

another man, one more beast than human. Get up.”
Murtagh warily complied, his eyes darting between the Twins and Ajihad. “Remove your shirt,” ordered
Ajihad. With a shrug, Murtagh pulled off his tunic. “Now turn around.” As he pivoted to the side, light fell
upon the scar on his back.
“Murtagh,” breathed Ajihad. A grunt of surprise came from Orik. Without warning, Ajihad turned on the
Twins and thundered, “Did you know of this?”
The Twins bowed their heads. “We discovered his name in Eragon’s mind, but we did not suspect that
thisboy was the son of one as powerful as Morzan. It never occurred—”
“And you didn’t tell me?” demanded Ajihad. He raised a hand, forestalling their explanation. “We will
discuss it later.” He faced Murtagh again. “First I must untangle this muddle. Do you still refuse to be
probed?”
“Yes,” said Murtagh sharply, slipping back into his tunic. “I won’t let anyone inside my head.”
Ajihad leaned on his desk. “There will be unpleasant consequences if you don’t. Unless the Twins can
certify that you aren’t a threat, we cannot give you credence, despite, and perhaps because of, the
assistance you have given Eragon. Without that verification, the people here, dwarf and human alike, will
tear you apart if they learn of your presence. I’ll be forced to keep you confined at all times—as much
for your protection as for ours. It will only get worse once the dwarf king, Hrothgar, demands custody of
you. Don’t force yourself into that situation when it can easily be avoided.”
Murtagh shook his head stubbornly. “No… even if I were to submit, I would still be treated like a leper
and an outcast. All I wish is to leave. If you let me do that peacefully, I’ll never reveal your location to the
Empire.”
“What will happen if you are captured and brought before Galbatorix?” demanded Ajihad. “He will
extract every secret from your mind, no matter how strong you may be. Even if you could resist him, how
can we trust that you won’t rejoin him in the future? I cannot take that chance.”
“Will you hold me prisoner forever?” demanded Murtagh, straightening.
“No,” said Ajihad, “only until you let yourself be examined. If you are found trustworthy, the Twins will
remove all knowledge of Farthen Dûr’s location from your mind before you leave. We won’t risk
someone with those memories falling into Galbatorix’s hands. What is it to be, Murtagh? Decide quickly
or else the path will be chosen for you.”
Just give in,Eragon pleaded silently, concerned for Murtagh’s safety.It’s not worth the fight.
Finally Murtagh spoke, the words slow and distinct. “My mind is the one sanctuary that has not been
stolen from me. Men have tried to breach it before, but I’ve learned to defend it vigorously, for I am only
safe with my innermost thoughts. You have asked for the one thing I cannot give, least of all to those
two.” He gestured at the Twins. “Do with me what you will, but know this: death will take me before I’ll
expose myself to their probing.”
Admiration glinted in Ajihad’s eyes. “I’m not surprised by your choice, though I had hoped otherwise…
Guards!” The cedar door slammed open as warriors rushed in, weapons ready. Ajihad pointed at
Murtagh and commanded, “Take him to a windowless room and bar the door securely. Post six men by

Page 241

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

the entrance and allow no one inside until I come to see him. Do not speak to him, either.”
The warriors surrounded Murtagh, watching him suspiciously. As they left the study, Eragon caught
Murtagh’s attention and mouthed, “I’m sorry.” Murtagh shrugged, then stared forward resolutely. He
vanished into the hallway with the men. The sound of their feet faded into silence.
Ajihad said abruptly, “I want everyone out of this room but Eragon and Saphira. Now!”
Bowing, the Twins departed, but Orik said, “Sir, the king will want to know of Murtagh. And there is
still the matter of my insubordination…”
Ajihad frowned, then waved his hand. “I will tell Hrothgar myself. As for your actions… wait outside
until I call for you. And don’t let the Twins get away. I’m not done with them, either.”
“Very well,” said Orik, inclining his head. He closed the door with a solid thump.
After a long silence, Ajihad sat with a tired sigh. He ran a hand over his face and stared at the ceiling.
Eragon waited impatiently for him to speak. When nothing was forthcoming, he blurted, “Is Arya all
right?”
Ajihad looked down at him and said gravely, “No… but the healers tell me she will recover. They
worked on her all through the night. The poison took a dreadful toll on her. She wouldn’t have lived if not
for you. For that you have the Varden’s deepest thanks.”
Eragon’s shoulders slumped with relief. For the first time he felt that their flight from Gil’ead had been
worth the effort. “So, what now?” he asked.
“I need you to tell me how you found Saphira and everything that’s happened since,” said Ajihad,
forming a steeple with his fingers. “Some of it I know from the message Brom sent us, other parts from
the Twins. But I want to hear it from you, especially the details concerning Brom’s death.”
Eragon was reluctant to share his experiences with a stranger, but Ajihad was patient.Go on, urged
Saphira gently. Eragon shifted, then began his story. It was awkward at first but grew easier as he
proceeded. Saphira helped him to remember things clearly with occasional comments. Ajihad listened
intently the entire time.
Eragon talked for hours, often pausing between his words. He told Ajihad of Teirm, though he kept
Angela’s fortunetelling to himself, and how he and Brom had found the Ra’zac. He even related his
dreams of Arya. When he came to Gil’ead and mentioned the Shade, Ajihad’s face hardened, and he
leaned back with veiled eyes.
When his narrative was complete, Eragon fell silent, brooding on all that had occurred. Ajihad stood,
clasped his hands behind his back, and absently studied one of the bookshelves. After a time he returned
to the desk.
“Brom’s death is a terrible loss. He was a close friend of mine and a powerful ally of the Varden. He
saved us from destruction many times through his bravery and intelligence. Even now, when he is gone,
he’s provided us with the one thing that can ensure our success—you.”
“But what can you expect me to accomplish?” asked Eragon.

Page 242

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“I will explain it in full,” said Ajihad, “but there are more urgent matters to be dealt with first. The news
of the Urgals’ alliance with the Empire is extremely serious. If Galbatorix is gathering an Urgal army to
destroy us, the Varden will be hard pressed to survive, even though many of us are protected here in
Farthen Dûr. That a Rider, even one as evil as Galbatorix, would consider a pact with such monsters is
indeed proof of madness. I shudder to think of what he promised them in return for their fickle loyalty.
And then there is the Shade. Can you describe him?”
Eragon nodded. “He was tall, thin, and very pale, with red eyes and hair. He was dressed all in black.”
“What of his sword—did you see it?” asked Ajihad intensely. “Did it have a long scratch on the blade?”
“Yes,” said Eragon, surprised. “How did you know?”
“Because I put it there while trying to cut out his heart,” said Ajihad with a grim smile. “His name is
Durza—one of the most vicious and cunning fiends to ever stalk this land. He is the perfect servant for
Galbatorix and a dangerous enemy for us. You say that you killed him. How was it done?”
Eragon remembered it vividly. “Murtagh shot him twice. The first arrow caught him in the shoulder; the
second one struck him between the eyes.”
“I was afraid of that,” said Ajihad, frowning. “You didn’t kill him. Shades can only be destroyed by a
thrust through the heart. Anything short of that will cause them to vanish and then reappear elsewhere in
spirit form. It’s an unpleasant process, but Durza will survive and return stronger than ever.”
A moody silence settled over them like a foreboding thunderhead. Then Ajihad stated, “You are an
enigma, Eragon, a quandary that no one knows how to solve. Everyone knows what the Varden
want—or the Urgals, or even Galbatorix—but no one knows whatyou want. And that makes you
dangerous, especially to Galbatorix. He fears you because he doesn’t know what you will do next.”
“Do the Varden fear me?” asked Eragon quietly.
“No,” said Ajihad carefully. “We are hopeful. But if that hope proves false, then yes, we will be afraid.”
Eragon looked down. “You must understand the unusual nature of your position. There are factions who
want you to serve their interests and no one else’s. The moment you entered Farthen Dûr, their influence
and power began tugging on you.”
“Including yours?” asked Eragon.
Ajihad chuckled, though his eyes were sharp. “Including mine. There are certain things you should know:
first is how Saphira’s egg happened to appear in the Spine. Did Brom ever tell you what was done with
her egg after he brought it here?”
“No,” said Eragon, glancing at Saphira. She blinked and flicked her tongue at him.
Ajihad tapped his desk before beginning. “When Brom first brought the egg to the Varden, everyone
was deeply interested in its fate. We had thought the dragons were exterminated. The dwarves were
solely concerned with making sure that the future Rider would be an ally—though some of them were
opposed to having a new Rider at all—while the elves and Varden had a more personal stake in the
matter. The reason was simple enough: throughout history all the Riders have been either elven or human,
with the majority being elven. There has never been a dwarf Rider.

Page 243

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“Because of Galbatorix’s betrayals, the elves were reluctant to let any of the Varden handle the egg for
fear that the dragon inside would hatch for a human with similar instabilities. It was a challenging situation,
as both sides wanted the Rider for their own. The dwarves only aggravated the problem by arguing
obstinately with both the elves and us whenever they had the chance. Tensions escalated, and before
long, threats were made that were later regretted. It was then that Brom suggested a compromise that
allowed all sides to save face.
“He proposed that the egg be ferried between the Varden and the elves every year. At each place
children would parade past it, and then the bearers of the egg would wait to see if the dragon would
hatch. If it didn’t, they would leave and return to the other group. But if the dragondid hatch, the new
Rider’s training would be undertaken immediately. For the first year or so he or she would be instructed
here, by Brom. Then the Rider would be taken to the elves, who would finish the education.
“The elves reluctantly accepted this plan… with the stipulation that if Brom were to die before the
dragon hatched, they would be free to train the new Rider without interference. The agreement was
slanted in their favor—we both knew that the dragon would likely chose an elf—but it provided a
desperately needed semblance of equality.”
Ajihad paused, his rich eyes somber. Shadows bit into his face under his cheekbones, making them jut
out. “It was hoped that this new Rider would bring our two races closer together. We waited for well
over a decade, but the egg never hatched. The matter passed from our minds, and we rarely thought
about it except to lament the egg’s inactivity.
“Then last year we suffered a terrible loss. Arya and the egg disappeared on her return from Tronjheim
to the elven city Osilon. The elves were the first to discover she was missing. They found her steed and
guards slain in Du Weldenvarden and a group of slaughtered Urgals nearby. But neither Arya nor the egg
was there. When this news reached me, I feared that Urgals had both of them and would soon learn the
location of Farthen Dûr and the elves’ capital, Ellesméra, where their queen, Islanzadi, lives. Now I
understand they were working for the Empire, which is far worse.
“We won’t know exactly what occurred during that attack until Arya wakes, but I have deduced a few
details from what you’ve said.” Ajihad’s vest rustled as he leaned his elbows on the desk. “The attack
must have been swift and decisive, else Arya would have escaped. Without any warning, and deprived of
a place to hide, she could have done only one thing—used magic to transport the egg elsewhere.”
“She can use magic?” asked Eragon. Arya had mentioned that she had been given a drug to suppress
her power; he wanted to confirm that she meant magic. He wondered if she could teach him more words
of the ancient language.
“It was one of the reasons why she was chosen to guard the egg. Anyway, Arya couldn’t have returned
it to us—she was too far away—and the elves’ realm is warded by arcane barriers that prevent anything
from entering their borders through magical means. She must have thought of Brom and, in desperation,
sent the egg toward Carvahall. Without time to prepare, I’m not surprised she missed by the margin she
did. The Twins tell me it is an imprecise art.”
“Why was she closer to Palancar Valley than the Varden?” asked Eragon. “Where do the elves really
live? Where is this… Ellesméra?”
Ajihad’s keen gaze bored into Eragon as he considered the question. “I don’t tell you this lightly, for the
elves guard the knowledge jealously. But you should know, and I do this as a display of trust. Their cities
lie far to the north, in the deepest reaches of the endless forest Du Weldenvarden. Not since the Riders’

time has anyone, dwarf or human, been elf-friend enough to walk in their leafy halls. I do not even know
how to find Ellesméra. As for Osilon… based on where Arya disappeared, I suspect it is near Du
Weldenvarden’s western edge, toward Carvahall. You must have many other questions, but bear with
me and keep them until I have finished.”
He gathered his memories, then spoke at a quickened pace. “When Arya disappeared, the elves
withdrew their support from the Varden. Queen Islanzadi was especially enraged and refused any further
contact with us. As a result, even though I received Brom’s message, the elves are still ignorant of you
and Saphira… Without their supplies to sustain my troops, we have fared badly these past months in
skirmishes with the Empire.
“With Arya’s return and your arrival, I expect the queen’s hostility will abate. The fact that you rescued
Arya will greatly help our case with her. Your training, however, is going to present a problem for both
Varden and elves. Brom obviously had a chance to teach you, but we need to know how thorough he
was. For that reason, you’ll have to be tested to determine the extent of your abilities. Also, the elves will
expect you to finish your training with them, though I’m not sure if there’s time for that.”
“Why not?” asked Eragon.
“For several reasons. Chief among them, the tidings you brought about the Urgals,” said Ajihad, his eyes
straying to Saphira. “You see, Eragon, the Varden are in an extremely delicate position. On one hand,
we have to comply with the elves’ wishes if we want to keep them as allies. At the same time, we cannot
anger the dwarves if we wish to lodge in Tronjheim.”
“Aren’t the dwarves part of the Varden?” asked Eragon.
Ajihad hesitated. “In a sense, yes. They allow us to live here and provide assistance in our struggle
against the Empire, but they are loyal only to their king. I have no power over them except for what
Hrothgar gives me, and even he often has trouble with the dwarf clans. The thirteen clans are subservient
to Hrothgar, but each clan chief wields enormous power; they choose the new dwarf king when the old
one dies. Hrothgar is sympathetic to our cause, but many of the chiefs aren’t. He can’t afford to anger
them unnecessarily or he’ll lose the support of his people, so his actions on our behalf have been severely
circumscribed.”
“These clan chiefs,” said Eragon, “are they against me as well?”
“Even more so, I’m afraid,” said Ajihad wearily. “There has long been enmity between dwarves and
dragons—before the elves came and made peace, dragons made a regular habit of eating the dwarves’
flocks and stealing their gold—and the dwarves are slow to forget past wrongs. Indeed, they never fully
accepted the Riders or allowed them to police their kingdom. Galbatorix’s rise to power has only served
to convince many of them that it would be better never to deal with Riders or dragons ever again.” He
directed his last words at Saphira.
Eragon said slowly, “Why doesn’t Galbatorix know where Farthen Dûr and Ellesméra are? Surely he
was told of them when he was instructed by the Riders.”
“Told of them, yes—shown where they are, no. It’s one thing to know that Farthen Dûr lies within these
mountains, quite another to find it. Galbatorix hadn’t been taken to either place before his dragon was
killed. After that, of course, the Riders didn’t trust him. He tried to force the information out of several
Riders during his rebellion, but they chose to die rather than reveal it to him. As for the dwarves, he’s
never managed to capture one alive, though it’s only a matter of time.”

“Then why doesn’t he just take an army and march through Du Weldenvarden until he finds Ellesméra?”
asked Eragon.
“Because the elves still have enough power to resist him,” said Ajihad. “He doesn’t dare test his strength
against theirs, at least not yet. But his cursed sorcery grows stronger each year. With another Rider at his
side, he would be unstoppable. He keeps trying to get one of his two eggs to hatch, but so far he’s been
unsuccessful.”
Eragon was puzzled. “How can his power be increasing? The strength of his body limits his abilities—it
can’t build itself up forever.”
“We don’t know,” said Ajihad, shrugging his broad shoulders, “and neither do the elves. We can only
hope that someday he will be destroyed by one of his own spells.” He reached inside his vest and
somberly pulled out a battered piece of parchment. “Do you know what this is?” he asked, placing it on
the desk.
Eragon bent forward and examined it. Lines of black script, written in an alien language, were inked
across the page. Large sections of the writing had been destroyed by blots of blood. One edge of the
parchment was charred. He shook his head. “No, I don’t.”
“It was taken from the leader of the Urgal host we destroyed last night. It cost us twelve men to do
so—they sacrificed themselves so that you might escape safely. The writing is the king’s invention, a
script he uses to communicate with his servants. It took me a while, but I was able to devise its meaning,
at least where it’s legible. It reads:

…gatekeeper at Ithrö Zhâda is to let this bearer and his minions pass. They are to be bunked with the
others of their kind and by… but only if the two factions refrain from fighting. Command will be given
under Tarok, under Gashz, under Durza, under Ushnark the Mighty.

“Ushnark is Galbatorix. It means ‘father’ in the Urgal tongue, an affectation that pleases him.

Find what they are suitable for and… The footmen and… are to be kept separate. No weapons are to
be distributed until… for marching.

“Nothing else can be read past there, except for a few vague words,” said Ajihad.
“Where’s Ithrö Zhâda? I’ve never heard of it.”
“Nor have I,” confirmed Ajihad, “which makes me suspect that Galbatorix has renamed an existing
place for his own purposes. After deciphering this, I asked myself what hundreds of Urgals were doing
by the Beor Mountains where you first saw them and where they were going. The parchment mentions
‘others of their kind,’ so I assume there are even more Urgals at their destination. There’s only one

Page 246

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

reason for the king to gather such a force—to forge a bastard army of humans and monsters to destroy
us.
“For now, there is nothing to do but wait and watch. Without further information we cannot find this
Ithrö Zhâda. Still, Farthen Dûr has not yet been discovered, so there is hope. The only Urgals to have
seen it died last night.”
“How did you know we were coming?” asked Eragon. “One of the Twins was waiting for us, and there
was an ambush in place for the Kull.” He was aware of Saphira listening intently. Though she kept her
own counsel, he knew she would have things to say later.
“We have sentinels placed at the entrance of the valley you traveled through—on either side of the
Beartooth River. They sent a dove to warn us,” explained Ajihad.
Eragon wondered if it was the same bird Saphira had tried to eat. “When the egg and Arya disappeared,
did you tell Brom? He said that he hadn’t heard anything from the Varden.”
“We tried to alert him,” said Ajihad, “but I suspect our men were intercepted and killed by the Empire.
Why else would the Ra’zac have gone to Carvahall? After that, Brom was traveling with you, and it was
impossible to get word to him. I was relieved when he contacted me via messenger from Teirm. It didn’t
surprise me that he went to Jeod; they were old friends. And Jeod could easily send us a message
because he smuggles supplies to us through Surda.
“All of this has raised serious questions. How did the Empire know where to ambush Arya and, later,
our messengers to Carvahall? How has Galbatorix learned which merchants help the Varden? Jeod’s
business has been virtually destroyed since you left him, as have those of other merchants who support
us. Every time one of their ships sets sail, it disappears. The dwarves cannot give us everything we need,
so the Varden are in desperate need of supplies. I’m afraid that we have a traitor, or traitors, in our
midst, despite our efforts to examine people’s minds for deceit.”
Eragon sank deep in thought, pondering what he had learned. Ajihad waited calmly for him to speak,
undisturbed by the silence. For the first time since finding Saphira’s egg, Eragon felt that he understood
what was going on around him. At last he knew where Saphira came from and what might lie in his
future. “What do you want from me?” he asked.
“How do you mean?”
“I mean, what is expected of me in Tronjheim? You and the elves have plans for me, but what if I don’t
like them?” A hard note crept into his voice. “I’ll fight when needed, revel when there’s occasion, mourn
when there is grief, and die if my time comes… but I won’t let anyone use me against my will.” He
paused to let the words sink in. “The Riders of old were arbiters of justice above and beyond the leaders
of their time. I don’t claim that position—I doubt people would accept such oversight when they’ve been
free of it all their lives, especially from one as young as me. But Ido have power, and I will wield it as I
see fit. What I want to know is howyou plan to use me. Then I will decide whether to agree to it.”
Ajihad looked at him wryly. “If you were anyone else and were before another leader, you would likely
have been killed for that insolent speech. What makes you think I will expose my plans just because you
demand it?” Eragon flushed but did not lower his gaze. “Still, you are right. Your position gives you the
privilege to say such things. You cannot escape the politics of your situation—youwill be influenced, one
way or another. I don’t want to see you become a pawn of any one group or purpose any more than you
do. You must retain your freedom, for in it lies your true power: the ability to make choices independent

Page 247

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

of any leader or king. My own authority over you will be limited, but I believe it’s for the best. The
difficulty lies in making sure that those with power include you in their deliberations.
“Also, despite your protests, the people here have certain expectations of you. They are going to bring
you their problems, no matter how petty, and demand that you solve them.” Ajihad leaned forward, his
voice deadly serious. “There will be cases where someone’s future will rest in your hands… with a word
you can send them careening into happiness or misery. Young women will seek your opinion on whom
they should marry—many will pursue you as a husband—and old men will ask which of their children
should receive an inheritance. Youmust be kind and wise with them all, for they put their trust in you.
Don’t speak flippantly or without thought, because your words will have impact far beyond what you
intend.”
Ajihad leaned back, his eyes hooded. “The burden of leadership is being responsible for the well-being
of the people in your charge. I have dealt with it from the day I was chosen to head the Varden, and now
you must as well. Be careful. I won’t tolerate injustice under my command. Don’t worry about your
youth and inexperience; they will pass soon enough.”
Eragon was uncomfortable with the idea of people asking him for advice. “But you still haven’t said what
I’m to do here.”
“For now, nothing. You covered over a hundred and thirty leagues in eight days, a feat to be proud of.
I’m sure that you’ll appreciate rest. When you’ve recovered, we will test your competency in arms and
magic. After that—well, I will explain your options, and then you’ll have to decide your course.”
“And what about Murtagh?” asked Eragon bitingly.
Ajihad’s face darkened. He reached beneath his desk and lifted up Zar’roc. The sword’s polished
sheath gleamed in the light. Ajihad slid his hand over it, lingering on the etched sigil. “He will stay here
until he allows the Twins into his mind.”
“You can’t imprison him,” argued Eragon. “He’s committed no crime!”
“We can’t give him his freedom without being sure that he won’t turn against us. Innocent or not, he’s
potentially as dangerous to us as his father was,” said Ajihad with a hint of sadness.
Eragon realized that Ajihad would not be convinced otherwise, and his concernwas valid. “How were
you able to recognize his voice?”
“I met his father once,” said Ajihad shortly. He tapped Zar’roc’s hilt. “I wish Brom had told me he had
taken Morzan’s sword. I suggest that you don’t carry it within Farthen Dûr. Many here remember
Morzan’s time with hate, especially the dwarves.”
“I’ll remember that,” promised Eragon.
Ajihad handed Zar’roc to him. “That reminds me, I have Brom’s ring, which he sent as confirmation of
his identity. I was keeping it for when he returned to Tronjheim. Now that he’s dead, I suppose it
belongs to you, and I think he would have wanted you to have it.” He opened a desk drawer and took
the ring from it.
Eragon accepted it with reverence. The symbol cut into the face of the sapphire was identical to the
tattoo on Arya’s shoulder. He fit the ring onto his index finger, admiring how it caught the light. “I… I am

honored,” he said.
Ajihad nodded gravely, then pushed back his chair and stood. He faced Saphira and spoke to her, his
voice swelling in power. “Do not think that I have forgotten you, O mighty dragon. I have said these
things as much for your benefit as for Eragon’s. It is even more important that you know them, for to you
falls the task of guarding him in these dangerous times. Do not underestimate your might nor falter at his
side, because without you he will surely fail.”
Saphira lowered her head until their eyes were level and stared at him through slitted black pupils. They
examined each other silently, neither of them blinking. Ajihad was the first to move. He lowered his eyes
and said softly, “It is indeed a privilege to meet you.”
He’ll do,said Saphira respectfully. She swung her head to face Eragon. Tell him that I am impressed
both with Tronjheim and with him. The Empire is right to fear him. Let him know, however, that if he had
decided to kill you, I would have destroyed Tronjheim and torn him apart with my teeth.
Eragon hesitated, surprised by the venom in her voice, then relayed the message. Ajihad looked at her
seriously. “I would expect nothing less from one so noble—but I doubt you could have gotten past the
Twins.”
Saphira snorted with derision.Bah!
Knowing what she meant, Eragon said, “Then they must be much stronger than they appear. I think they
would be sorely dismayed if they ever faced a dragon’s wrath. The two of them might be able to defeat
me, but never Saphira. You should know, a Rider’s dragon strengthens his magic beyond what a normal
magician might have. Brom was always weaker than me because of that. I think that in the absence of
Riders, the Twins have overestimated their power.”
Ajihad looked troubled. “Brom was considered one of our strongest spell weavers. Only the elves
surpassed him. If what you say is true, we will have to reconsider a great many things.” He bowed to
Saphira. “As it is, I am glad it wasn’t necessary to harm either of you.” Saphira dipped her head in return.
Ajihad straightened with a lordly air and called, “Orik!” The dwarf hurried into the room and stood
before the desk, crossing his arms. Ajihad frowned at him, irritated. “You’ve caused me a great deal of
trouble, Orik. I’ve had to listen to one of the Twins complain all morning about your insubordination.
They won’t let it rest until you are punished. Unfortunately they’re right. It’s a serious matter that cannot
be ignored. An accounting is due.”
Orik’s eyes flicked toward Eragon, but his face betrayed no emotion. He spoke quickly in rough tones.
“The Kull were almost around Kóstha-mérna. They were shooting arrows at the dragon, Eragon, and
Murtagh, but the Twins did nothing to stop it. Like… sheilven, they refused to open the gates even
though we could see Eragon shouting the opening phrase on the other side of the waterfall. And they
refused to take action when Eragon did not rise from the water. Perhaps I did wrong, but I couldn’t let a
Rider die.”
“I wasn’t strong enough to get out of the water myself,” offered Eragon. “I would have drowned if he
hadn’t pulled me out.”
Ajihad glanced at him, then asked Orik seriously, “And later, why did you oppose them?”
Orik raised his chin defiantly. “It wasn’t right for them to force their way into Murtagh’s mind. But I

Page 249

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

wouldn’t have stopped them if I’d known who he was.”
“No, you did the right thing, though it would be simpler if you hadn’t. It isn’t our place to force our way
into people’s minds, no matter who they are.” Ajihad fingered his dense beard. “Your actions were
honorable, but you did defy a direct order from your commander. The penalty for that has always been
death.” Orik’s back stiffened.
“You can’t kill him for that! He was only helping me,” cried Eragon.
“It isn’t your place to interfere,” said Ajihad sternly. “Orik broke the law and must suffer the
consequences.” Eragon started to argue again, but Ajihad stopped him with a raised hand. “But you are
right. The sentence will be mitigated because of the circumstances. As of now, Orik, you are removed
from active service and forbidden to engage in any military activities under my command. Do you
understand?”
Orik’s face darkened, but then he only looked confused. He nodded sharply. “Yes.”
“Furthermore, in the absence of your regular duties, I appoint you Eragon and Saphira’s guide for the
duration of their stay. You are to make sure they receive every comfort and amenity we have to offer.
Saphira will stay above Isidar Mithrim. Eragon may have quarters wherever he wants. When he recovers
from his trip, take him to the training fields. They’re expecting him,” said Ajihad, a twinkle of amusement
in his eye.
Orik bowed low. “I understand.”
“Very well, you all may go. Send in the Twins as you leave.”
Eragon bowed and began to leave, then asked, “Where can I find Arya? I would like to see her.”
“No one is allowed to visit her. You will have to wait until she comes to you.” Ajihad looked down at his
desk in a clear dismissal.
BLESS THECHILD,ARGETLAM
Eragon stretched in the hall; he was stiff from sitting so long. Behind him, the Twins entered Ajihad’s
study and closed the door. Eragon looked at Orik. “I’m sorry that you’re in trouble because of me,” he
apologized.
“Don’t bother yourself,” grunted Orik, tugging on his beard. “Ajihad gave me what I wanted.”
Even Saphira was startled by the statement. “What do you mean?” said Eragon. “You can’t train or
fight, and you’re stuck guarding me. How can that be what you wanted?”
The dwarf eyed him quietly. “Ajihad is a good leader. He understands how to keep the law yet remain
just. I have been punished by his command, but I’m also one of Hrothgar’s subjects. Under his rule, I’m
still free to do what I wish.”
Eragon realized it would be unwise to forget Orik’s dual loyalty and the split nature of power within
Tronjheim. “Ajihad just placed you in a powerful position, didn’t he?”
Orik chuckled deeply. “That he did, and in such a way the Twins can’t complain about it. This’ll irritate

Page 250

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

them for sure. Ajihad’s a tricky one, he is. Come, lad, I’m sure you’re hungry. And we have to get your
dragon settled in.”
Saphira hissed. Eragon said, “Her name is Saphira.”
Orik made a small bow to her. “My apologies, I’ll be sure to remember that.” He took an orange lamp
from the wall and led them down the hallway.
“Can others in Farthen Dûr use magic?” asked Eragon, struggling to keep up with the dwarf’s brisk
pace. He cradled Zar’roc carefully, concealing the symbol on the sheath with his arm.
“Few enough,” said Orik with a swift shrug under his mail. “And the ones we have can’t do much more
than heal bruises. They’ve all had to tend to Arya because of the strength needed to heal her.”
“Except for the Twins.”
“Oeí,” grumbled Orik. “She wouldn’t want their help anyway; their arts are not for healing. Their talents
lie in scheming and plotting for power—to everyone else’s detriment. Deynor, Ajihad’s predecessor,
allowed them to join the Varden because he needed their support… you can’t oppose the Empire
without spellcasters who can hold their own on the field of battle. They’re a nasty pair, but they do have
their uses.”
They entered one of the four main tunnels that divided Tronjheim. Clusters of dwarves and humans
strolled through it, voices echoing loudly off the polished floor. The conversations stopped abruptly as
they saw Saphira; scores of eyes fixed on her. Orik ignored the spectators and turned left, heading
toward one of Tronjheim’s distant gates. “Where are we going?” asked Eragon.
“Out of these halls so Saphira can fly to the dragonhold above Isidar Mithrim, the Star Rose. The
dragonhold doesn’t have a roof—Tronjheim’s peak is open to the sky, like that of Farthen Dûr—so she,
that is, you, Saphira, will be able to glide straight down into the hold. It is where the Riders used to stay
when they visited Tronjheim.”
“Won’t it be cold and damp without a roof?” asked Eragon.
“Nay.” Orik shook his head. “Farthen Dûr protects us from the elements. Neither rain nor snow intrude
here. Besides, the hold’s walls are lined with marble caves for dragons. They provide all the shelter
necessary. All you need fear are the icicles; when they fall they’ve been known to cleave a horse in two.”
I will be fine,assured Saphira.A marble cave is safer than any of the other places we’ve stayed.
Perhaps… Do you think Murtagh will be all right?
Ajihad strikes me as an honorable man. Unless Murtagh tries to escape, I doubt he will be harmed.
Eragon crossed his arms, unwilling to talk further. He was dazed by the change in circumstances from
the day before. Their mad race from Gil’ead was finally over, but his body expected to continue running
and riding. “Where are our horses?”
“In the stables by the gate. We can visit them before leaving Tronjheim.”

Page 251

They exited Tronjheim through the same gate they had entered. The gold griffins gleamed with colored
highlights garnered from scores of lanterns. The sun had moved during Eragon’s talk with Ajihad—light
no longer entered Farthen Dûr through the crater opening. Without those moted rays, the inside of the
hollow mountain was velvety black. The only illumination came from Tronjheim, which sparkled brilliantly
in the gloom. The city-mountain’s radiance was enough to brighten the ground hundreds of feet away.
Orik pointed at Tronjheim’s white pinnacle. “Fresh meat and pure mountain water await you up there,”
he told Saphira. “You may stay in any of the caves. Once you make your choice, bedding will be laid
down in it and then no one will disturb you.”
“I thought we were going to go together. I don’t want to be separated,” protested Eragon.
Orik turned to him. “Rider Eragon, I will do everything to accommodate you, but it would be best if
Saphira waits in the dragonhold while you eat. The tunnels to the banquet halls aren’t large enough for her
to accompany us.”
“Why can’t you just bring me food in the hold?”
“Because,” said Orik with a guarded expression, “the food is prepared down here, and it is a long way
to the top. If you wish, a servant could be sent up to the hold with a meal for you. It will take some time,
but you could eat with Saphira then.”
He actually means it,Eragon thought, astonished that they would do so much for him. But the way Orik
said it made him wonder if the dwarf was testing him somehow.
I’m weary,said Saphira.And this dragonhold sounds to my liking. Go, have your meal, then come to me.
It will be soothing to rest together without fear of wild animals or soldiers. We have suffered the
hardships of the trail too long.
Eragon looked at her thoughtfully, then said to Orik, “I’ll eat down here.” The dwarf smiled, seeming
satisfied. Eragon unstrapped Saphira’s saddle so she could lie down without discomfort.Would you take
Zar’roc with you?
Yes,she said, gathering up the sword and saddle with her claws.But keep your bow. We must trust
these people, though not to the point of foolishness.
I know,he said, disquieted.
With an explosive leap Saphira swept off the ground and into the still air. The steady whoosh of her
wings was the only sound in the darkness. As she disappeared over the rim of Tronjheim’s peak, Orik let
out a long breath. “Ah boy, you have been blessed indeed. I find a sudden longing in my heart for open
skies and soaring cliffs and the thrill of hunting like a hawk. Still, my feet are better on the
ground—preferably under it.”
He clapped his hands loudly. “I neglect my duties as host. I know you’ve not dined since that pitiful
dinner the Twins saw fit to give you, so come, let’s find the cooks and beg meat and bread from them!”
Eragon followed the dwarf back into Tronjheim and through a labyrinth of corridors until they came to a
long room filled with rows of stone tables only high enough for dwarves. Fires blazed in soapstone ovens
behind a long counter.

Page 252

Orik spoke words in an unfamiliar language to a stout ruddy-faced dwarf, who promptly handed them
stone platters piled with steaming mushrooms and fish. Then Orik took Eragon up several flights of stairs
and into a small alcove carved out of Tronjheim’s outer wall, where they sat cross-legged. Eragon
wordlessly reached for his food.
When their platters were empty, Orik sighed with contentment and pulled out a long-stemmed pipe. He
lit it, saying, “A worthy repast, though it needed a good draught of mead to wash it down properly.”
Eragon surveyed the ground below. “Do you farm in Farthen Dûr?”
“No, there’s only enough sunlight for moss, mushrooms, and mold. Tronjheim cannot survive without
supplies from the surrounding valleys, which is one reason why many of us choose to live elsewhere in the
Beor Mountains.”
“Then there are other dwarf cities?”
“Not as many as we would like. And Tronjheim is the greatest of them.” Leaning on an elbow, Orik
took a deep pull on his pipe. “You have only seen the lower levels, so it hasn’t been apparent, but most
of Tronjheim is deserted. The farther up you go, the emptier it gets. Entire floors have remained
untouched for centuries. Most dwarves prefer to dwell under Tronjheim and Farthen Dûr in the caverns
and passageways that riddle the rock. Through the centuries we have tunneled extensively under the Beor
Mountains. It is possible to walk from one end of the mountain range to the other without ever setting
foot on the surface.”
“It seems like a waste to have all that unused space in Tronjheim,” commented Eragon.
Orik nodded. “Some have argued for abandoning this place because of its drain on our resources, but
Tronjheim does perform one invaluable task.”
“What’s that?”
“In times of misfortune it can house our entire nation. There have been only three instances in our history
when we have been forced to that extreme, but each time it has saved us from certain and utter
destruction. That is why we always keep it garrisoned, ready for use.”
“I’ve never seen anything as magnificent,” admitted Eragon.
Orik smiled around his pipe. “I’m glad you find it so. It took generations to build Tronjheim—and our
lives are much longer than those of men. Unfortunately, because of the cursed Empire, few outsiders are
allowed to see its glory.”
“How many Varden are here?”
“Dwarves or humans?”
“Humans—I want to know how many have fled the Empire.”
Orik exhaled a long puff of smoke that coiled lazily around his head. “There are about four thousand of
your kin here. But that’s a poor indicator of what you want to know. Only people who wish to fight
come here. The rest of them are under King Orrin’s protection in Surda.”

Page 253

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

So few?thought Eragon with a sinking feeling. The royal army alone numbered nearly sixteen thousand
when it was fully marshaled, not counting the Urgals. “Why doesn’t Orrin fight the Empire himself?” he
asked.
“If he were to show open hostility,” said Orik, “Galbatorix would crush him. As it is, Galbatorix
withholds that destruction because he considers Surda a minor threat, which is a mistake. It’s through
Orrin’s assistance that the Varden have most of their weapons and supplies. Without him, there would be
no resisting the Empire.
“Don’t despair over the number of humans in Tronjheim. There are many dwarves here—many more
than you have seen—and all will fight when the time comes. Orrin has also promised us troops for when
we battle Galbatorix. The elves pledged their help as well.”
Eragon absently touched Saphira’s mind and found her busy eating a bloody haunch with gusto. He
noticed once more the hammer and stars engraved on Orik’s helm. “What does that mean? I saw it on
the floor in Tronjheim.”
Orik lifted the iron-bound cap off his head and brushed a rough finger over the engraving. “It is the
symbol of my clan. We are the Ingietum, metalworkers and master smiths. The hammer and stars are
inlaid into Tronjheim’s floor because it was the personal crest of Korgan, our founder. One clan to rule,
with twelve surrounding. King Hrothgar is Dûrgrimst Ingietum as well and has brought my house much
glory, much honor.”
When they returned the platters to the cook, they passed a dwarf in the hall. He stopped before Eragon,
bowed, and said respectfully, “Argetlam.”
The dwarf left Eragon fumbling for an answer, flushed with unease, yet also strangely pleased with the
gesture. No one had bowed to him before. “What did he say?” he asked, leaning closer to Orik.
Orik shrugged, embarrassed. “It’s an elven word that was used to refer to the Riders. It means ‘silver
hand.’ ” Eragon glanced at his gloved hand, thinking of the gedwëy ignasia that whitened his palm. “Do
you wish to return to Saphira?”
“Is there somewhere I could bathe first? I haven’t been able to wash off the grime of the road for a long
time. Also, my shirt is bloodstained and torn, and it stinks. I’d like to replace it, but I don’t have any
money to buy a new one. Is there a way I could work for one?”
“Do you seek to insult Hrothgar’s hospitality, Eragon?” demanded Orik. “As long as you are in
Tronjheim, you won’t have to buy a thing. You’ll pay for it in other ways—Ajihad and Hrothgar will see
to that. Come. I’ll show you where to wash, then fetch you a shirt.”
He took Eragon down a long staircase until they were well below Tronjheim. The corridors were tunnels
now—which cramped Eragon because they were only five feet high—and all the lanterns were red. “So
the light doesn’t blind you when you leave or enter a dark cavern,” explained Orik.
They entered a bare room with a small door on the far side. Orik pointed. “The pools are through there,
along with brushes and soap. Leave your clothes here. I’ll have new ones waiting when you get out.”
Eragon thanked him and started to undress. It felt oppressive being alone underground, especially with
the low rock ceiling. He stripped quickly and, cold, hurried through the door, into total darkness. He

inched forward until his foot touched warm water, then eased himself into it.
The pool was mildly salty, but soothing and calm. For a moment he was afraid of drifting away from the
door, into deeper water, but as he waded forward, he discovered the water reached only to his waist.
He groped over a slippery wall until he found the soap and brushes, then scrubbed himself. Afterward he
floated with his eyes closed, enjoying the warmth.
When he emerged, dripping, into the lighted room, he found a towel, a fine linen shirt, and a pair of
breeches. The clothes fit him reasonably well. Satisfied, he went out into the tunnel.
Orik was waiting for him, pipe in hand. They climbed the stairs back up into Tronjheim, then exited the
city-mountain. Eragon gazed at Tronjheim’s peak and called Saphira with his mind. As she flew down
from the dragonhold, he asked, “How do you communicate with people at the top of Tronjheim?”
Orik chuckled. “That’s a problem we solved long ago. You didn’t notice, but behind the open arches
that line each level is a single, unbroken staircase that spirals around the wall of Tronjheim’s central
chamber. The stairs climb all the way to the dragonhold above Isidar Mithrim. We call it Vol Turin, The
Endless Staircase. Running up or down it isn’t swift enough for an emergency, nor convenient enough for
casual use. Instead, we use flashing lanterns to convey messages. There is another way too, though it is
seldom used. When Vol Turin was constructed, a polished trough was cut next to it. The trough acts as a
giant slide as high as a mountain.”
Eragon’s lips twitched with a smile. “Is it dangerous?”
“Do not think of trying it. The slide was built for dwarves and is too narrow for a man. If you slipped out
of it, you could be thrown onto the stairs and against the arches, perhaps even into empty space.”
Saphira landed a spear’s throw away, her scales rustling dryly. As she greeted Eragon, humans and
dwarves trickled out of Tronjheim, gathering around her with murmurs of interest. Eragon regarded the
growing crowd uneasily. “You’d better go,” said Orik, pushing him forward. “Meet me by this gate
tomorrow morning. I’ll be waiting.”
Eragon balked. “How will I know when it’s morning?”
“I’ll have someone wake you. Now go!” Without further protest, Eragon slipped through the jostling
group that surrounded Saphira and jumped onto her back.
Before she could take off, an old woman stepped forward and grasped Eragon’s foot with a fierce grip.
He tried to pull away, but her hand was like an iron talon around his ankle—he could not break her
tenacious hold. The burning gray eyes she fixed on him were surrounded by a lifetime’s worth of
wrinkles—the skin was folded in long creases down her sunken cheeks. A tattered bundle rested in the
crook of her left arm.
Frightened, Eragon asked, “What do you want?”
The woman tilted her arm, and a cloth fell from the bundle, revealing a baby’s face. Hoarse and
desperate, she said, “The child has no parents—there is no one to care for her but me, and I am weak.
Bless her with your power, Argetlam. Bless her for luck!”
Eragon looked to Orik for help, but the dwarf only watched with a guarded expression. The small
crowd fell silent, waiting for his response. The woman’s eyes were still fastened on him. “Bless her,

Page 255

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Argetlam, bless her,” she insisted.
Eragon had never blessed anyone. It was not something done lightly in Alagaësia, as a blessing could
easily go awry and prove to be more curse than boon—especially if it was spoken with ill intent or lack
of conviction.Do I dare take that responsibility? he wondered.
“Bless her, Argetlam, bless her.”
Suddenly decided, he searched for a phrase or expression to use. Nothing came to mind until, inspired,
he thought of the ancient language. This would be a true blessing, spoken with words of power, by one of
power.
He bent down and tugged the glove off his right hand. Laying his palm on the babe’s brow, he intoned,
“Atra gülai un ilian tauthr ono un atra ono waíse skölir frá rauthr.” The words left him unexpectedly weak,
as if he had used magic. He slowly pulled the glove back on and said to the woman, “That is all I can do
for her. If any words have the power to forestall tragedy, it will be those.”
“Thank you, Argetlam,” she whispered, bowing slightly. She started to cover the baby again, but Saphira
snorted and twisted until her head loomed over the child. The woman grew rigid; her breath caught in her
chest. Saphira lowered her snout and brushed the baby between the eyes with the tip of her nose, then
smoothly lifted away.
A gasp ran through the crowd, for on the child’s forehead, where Saphira had touched her, was a
star-shaped patch of skin as white and silvery as Eragon’s gedwëy ignasia. The woman stared at Saphira
with a feverish gaze, wordless thanks in her eyes.
Immediately Saphira took flight, battering the awestruck spectators with the wind from her powerful
wing strokes. As the ground dwindled away, Eragon took a deep breath and hugged her neck tightly.
What did you do? he asked softly.
I gave her hope. And you gave her a future.
Loneliness suddenly flowered within Eragon, despite Saphira’s presence. Their surroundings were so
foreign—it struck him for the first time exactly how far he was from home. A destroyed home, but still
where his heart lay.What have I become, Saphira? he asked.I’m only in the first year of manhood, yet
I’ve consulted with the leader of the Varden, am pursued by Galbatorix, and have traveled with
Morzan’s son—and now blessings are sought from me! What wisdom can I give people that they haven’t
already learned? What feats can I achieve that an army couldn’t do better? It’s insanity! I should be back
in Carvahall with Roran.
Saphira took a long time to answer, but her words were gentle when they came.A hatchling, that is what
you are. A hatchling struggling into the world. I may be younger than you in years, but I am ancient in my
thoughts. Do not worry about these things. Find peace in where and what you are. People often know
what must be done. All you need do is show them the way—that is wisdom. As for feats, no army could
have given the blessing you did.
But it was nothing,he protested.A trifle.
Nay, it wasn’t. What you saw was the beginning of another story, another legend. Do you think that
child will ever be content to be a tavern keeper or a farmer when her brow is dragon-marked and your
words hang over her? You underestimate our power and that of fate.

Eragon bowed his head.It’s overwhelming. I feel as if I am living in an illusion, a dream where all things
are possible. Amazing things do happen, I know, but always to someone else, always in some far-off
place and time. But I found your egg, was tutored by a Rider, and dueled a Shade—those can’t be the
actions of the farm boy I am, or was. Something is changing me.
It is your wyrd that shapes you,said Saphira.Every age needs an icon—perhaps that lot has fallen to you.
Farm boys are not named for the first Rider without cause. Your namesake was the beginning, and now
you are the continuation. Or the end.
Ach,said Eragon, shaking his head.It’s like speaking in riddles… But if all is foreordained, do our
choices mean anything? Or must we just learn to accept our fate?
Saphira said firmly,Eragon, I chose you from within my egg. You have been given a chance most would
die for. Are you unhappy with that? Clear your mind of such thoughts. They cannot be answered and will
make you no happier.
True,he said glumly.All the same, they continue to bounce around within my skull.
Things have been… unsettled… ever since Brom died. It has made me uneasy,acknowledged Saphira,
which surprised him because she rarely seemed perturbed. They were above Tronjheim now. Eragon
looked down through the opening in its peak and saw the floor of the dragonhold: Isidar Mithrim, the
great star sapphire. He knew that beneath it was nothing but Tronjheim’s great central chamber. Saphira
descended to the dragonhold on silent wings. She slipped over its rim and dropped to Isidar Mithrim,
landing with the sharp clack of claws.
Won’t you scratch it?asked Eragon.
I think not. It’s no ordinary gem.Eragon slid off her back and slowly turned in a circle, absorbing the
unusual sight. They were in a round roofless room sixty feet high and sixty feet across. The walls were
lined with the dark openings of caves, which differed in size from grottoes no larger than a man to a
gaping cavern larger than a house. Shiny rungs were set into the marble walls so that people could reach
the highest caves. An enormous archway led out of the dragonhold.
Eragon examined the great gem under his feet and impulsively lay down on it. He pressed his cheek
against the cool sapphire, trying to see through it. Distorted lines and wavering spots of color glimmered
through the stone, but its thickness made it impossible to discern anything clearly on the floor of the
chamber a mile below them.
Will I have to sleep apart from you?
Saphira shook her enormous head.No, there is a bed for you in my cave. Come see. She turned and,
without opening her wings, jumped twenty feet into the air, landing in a medium-sized cave. He
clambered up after her.
The cave was dark brown on the inside and deeper than he had expected. The roughly chiseled walls
gave the impression of a natural formation. Near the far wall was a thick cushion large enough for Saphira
to curl up on. Beside it was a bed built into the side of the wall. The cave was lit by a single red lantern
equipped with a shutter so its glow could be muted.
I like this,said Eragon.It feels safe.

Page 257

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Yes.Saphira curled up on the cushion, watching him. With a sigh he sank onto the mattress, weariness
seeping through him.
Saphira, you haven’t said much while we’ve been here. What do you think of Tronjheim and Ajihad?
We shall see… It seems, Eragon, that we are embroiled in a new type of warfare here. Swords and
claws are useless, but words and alliances may have the same effect. The Twins dislike us—we should
be on our guard for any duplicities they might attempt. Not many of the dwarves trust us. The elves didn’t
want a human Rider, so there will be opposition from them as well. The best thing we can do is identify
those in power and befriend them. And quickly, too.
Do you think it’s possible to remain independent of the different leaders?
She shuffled her wings into a more comfortable position.Ajihad supports our freedom, but we may be
unable to survive without pledging our loyalty to one group or another. We’ll soon know either way.
MANDRAKEROOT ANDNEWT’STONGUE
The blankets were bunched underneath Eragon when he woke, but he was still warm. Saphira was
asleep on her cushion, her breath coming in steady gusts.
For the first time since entering Farthen Dûr, Eragon felt secure and hopeful. He was warm and fed and
had been able to sleep as long as he liked. Tension unknotted inside him—tension that had been
accumulating since Brom’s death and, even before, since leaving Palancar Valley.
I don’t have to be afraid anymore. But what about Murtagh?No matter the Varden’s hospitality, Eragon
could not accept it in good conscience, knowing that—intentionally or not—he had led Murtagh to his
imprisonment. Somehow the situation had to be resolved.
His gaze roamed the cave’s rough ceiling as he thought of Arya. Chiding himself for daydreaming, he
tilted his head and looked out at the dragonhold. A large cat sat on the edge of the cave, licking a paw. It
glanced at him, and he saw a flash of slanted red eyes.
Solembum?he asked incredulously.
Obviously.The werecat shook his rough mane and yawned languorously, displaying his long fangs. He
stretched, then jumped out of the cave, landing with a solid thump on Isidar Mithrim, twenty feet below.
Coming?
Eragon looked at Saphira. She was awake now, watching him motionlessly.Go. I will be fine, she
murmured. Solembum was waiting for him under the arch that led to the rest of Tronjheim.
The moment Eragon’s feet touched Isidar Mithrim, the werecat turned with a flick of his paws and
disappeared through the arch. Eragon chased after him, rubbing the sleep from his face. He stepped
through the archway and found himself standing at the top of Vol Turin, The Endless Staircase. There
was nowhere else to go, so he descended to the next level.
He stood in an open arcade that curved gently to the left and encircled Tronjheim’s central chamber.
Between the slender columns supporting the arches, Eragon could see Isidar Mithrim sparkling brilliantly
above him, as well as the city-mountain’s distant base. The circumference of the central chamber

Page 258

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

increased with each successive level. The staircase cut through the arcade’s floor to an identical level
below and descended through scores of arcades until it disappeared in the distance. The sliding trough
ran along the outside curve of the stairs. At the top of Vol Turin was a pile of leather squares to slide on.
To Eragon’s right, a dusty corridor led to that level’s rooms and apartments. Solembum padded down
the hall, flipping his tail.
Wait,said Eragon.
He tried to catch up with Solembum, but glimpsed him only fleetingly in the abandoned passageways.
Then, as Eragon rounded a corner, he saw the werecat stop before a door and yowl. Seemingly of its
own accord, the door slid inward. Solembum slipped inside, then the door shut. Eragon halted in front of
it, perplexed. He raised his hand to knock, but before he did, the door opened once more, and warm
light spilled out. After a moment’s indecision he stepped inside.
He entered an earthy two-room suite, lavishly decorated with carved wood and clinging plants. The air
was warm, fresh, and humid. Bright lanterns hung on the walls and from the low ceiling. Piles of intriguing
items cluttered the floor, obscuring the corners. A large four-poster bed, curtained by even more plants,
was in the far room.
In the center of the main room, on a plush leather chair, sat the fortuneteller and witch, Angela. She
smiled brightly.
“What are you doing here?” blurted Eragon.
Angela folded her hands in her lap. “Well, why don’t you sit on the floor and I’ll tell you? I’d offer you a
chair, but I’m sitting on the only one.” Questions buzzed through Eragon’s mind as he settled between
two flasks of acrid bubbling green potions.
“So!” exclaimed Angela, leaning forward. “Youare a Rider. I suspected as much, but I didn’t know for
certain until yesterday. I’m sure Solembum knew, but he never told me. I should have figured it out the
moment you mentioned Brom. Saphira… I like the name—fitting for a dragon.”
“Brom’s dead,” said Eragon abruptly. “The Ra’zac killed him.”
Angela was taken aback. She twirled a lock of her dense curls. “I’m sorry. I truly am,” she said softly.
Eragon smiled bitterly. “But not surprised, are you? You foretold his death, after all.”
“I didn’t know whose death it would be,” she said, shaking her head. “But no… I’m not surprised. I met
Brom once or twice. He didn’t care for my ‘frivolous’ attitude toward magic. It irritated him.”
Eragon frowned. “In Teirm you laughed at his fate and said that it was something of a joke. Why?”
Angela’s face tightened momentarily. “In retrospect, it was in rather bad taste, but I didn’t know what
would befall him. How do I put this?… Brom was cursed in a way. It was his wyrd to fail at all of his
tasks except one, although through no fault of his own. He was chosen as a Rider, but his dragon was
killed. He loved a woman, but it was his affection that was her undoing. And he was chosen, I assume, to
guard and train you, but in the end he failed at that as well. The only thing he succeeded at was killing
Morzan, and a better deed he couldn’t have done.”
“Brom never mentioned a woman to me,” retorted Eragon.

Page 259

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Angela shrugged carelessly. “I heard it from one who couldn’t have lied. But enough of this talk! Life
goes on, and we should not trouble the dead with our worries.” She scooped a pile of reeds from the
floor and deftly started plaiting them together, closing the subject to discussion.
Eragon hesitated, then gave in. “All right. So why are you in Tronjheim instead of Teirm?”
“Ah, at last an interesting question,” said Angela. “After hearing Brom’s name again during your visit, I
sensed a return of the past in Alagaësia. People were whispering that the Empire was hunting a Rider. I
knew then that the Varden’s dragon egg must have hatched, so I closed my shop and set out to learn
more.”
“You knew about the egg?”
“Of course I did. I’m not an idiot. I’ve been around much longer than you would believe. Very little
happens that I don’t know about.” She paused and concentrated on her weaving. “Anyway, I knew I
had to get to the Varden as fast as possible. I’ve been here for nearly a month now, though I really don’t
care for this place—it’s far too musty for my taste. And everyone in Farthen Dûr isso serious and noble.
They’re probably all doomed to tragic deaths anyway.” She gave a long sigh, a mocking expression on
her face. “And the dwarves are just a superstitious bunch of ninnies content to hammer rocks all their
lives. The only redeeming aspect of this place is all the mushrooms and fungi that grow inside Farthen
Dûr.”
“Then why stay?” asked Eragon, smiling.
“Because I like to be wherever important events are occurring,” said Angela, cocking her head.
“Besides, if I had stayed in Teirm, Solembum would have left without me, and I enjoy his company. But
tell me, what adventures have befallen you since last we talked?”
For the next hour, Eragon summarized his experiences of the last two and a half months. Angela listened
quietly, but when he mentioned Murtagh’s name she sputtered, “Murtagh!”
Eragon nodded. “He told me who he is. But let me finish my story before you make any judgments.” He
continued with his tale. When it was complete, Angela leaned back in her chair thoughtfully, her reeds
forgotten. Without warning, Solembum jumped out of a hiding place and landed in her lap. He curled up,
eyeing Eragon haughtily.
Angela petted the werecat. “Fascinating. Galbatorix allied with the Urgals, and Murtagh finally out in the
open… I’d warn you to be careful with Murtagh, but you’re obviously aware of the danger.”
“Murtagh has been a steadfast friend and an unwavering ally,” said Eragon firmly.
“All the same, be careful.” Angela paused, then said distastefully, “And then there’s the matter of this
Shade, Durza. I think he’s the greatest threat to the Varden right now, aside from Galbatorix. Iloathe
Shades—they practice the most unholy magic, after necromancy. I’d like to dig his heart out with a dull
hairpin and feed it to a pig!”
Eragon was startled by her sudden vehemence. “I don’t understand. Brom told me that Shades were
sorcerers who used spirits to accomplish their will, but why does that make them so evil?”
Angela shook her head. “It doesn’t. Ordinary sorcerers are just that, ordinary—neither better nor worse

Page 260

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

than the rest of us. They use their magical strength to control spirits and the spirits’ powers. Shades,
however, relinquish that control in their search for greater power and allow their bodies to be controlled
by spirits. Unfortunately, only the evilest spirits seek to possess humans, and once ensconced they never
leave. Such possession can happen by accident if a sorcerer summons a spirit stronger than himself. The
problem is, once a Shade is created, it’s terribly difficult to kill. As I’m sure you know, only two people,
Laetri the Elf and Irnstad the Rider, ever survived that feat.”
“I’ve heard the stories.” Eragon gestured at the room. “Why are you living so high up in Tronjheim? Isn’t
it inconvenient being this isolated? And how did you get all this stuff up here?”
Angela threw back her head and laughed wryly. “Truthfully? I’m in hiding. When I first came to
Tronjheim, I had a few days of peace—until one of guards who let me into Farthen Dûr blabbed about
who I was. Then all the magic users here, though theybarely rate the term, pestered me to join their
secret group. Especially those drajl Twins who control it. Finally, I threatened to turn the lot of them into
toads, excuse me, frogs, but when that didn’t deter them, I sneaked up here in the middle of the night. It
was less work than you might imagine, especially for one with my skills.”
“Did you have to let the Twins into your mind before you were allowed into Farthen Dûr?” asked
Eragon. “I was forced to let them sift through my memories.”
A cold gleam leapt into Angela’s eye. “The Twins wouldn’t dare probe me, for fear of what I might do
to them. Oh, they’d love to, but they know the effort would leave them broken and gibbering nonsense.
I’ve been coming here long before the Varden began examining people’s minds… and they’re not about
to start on me now.”
She peered into the other room and said, “Well! This has been an enlightening talk, but I’m afraid you
have to go now. My brew of mandrake root and newt’s tongue is about to boil, and it needs attending.
Do come back again when you have the time. Andplease don’t tell anyone that I’m here. I’d hate to have
to move again. It would make me very…irritated. And you don’t want to see me irritated!”
“I’ll keep your secret,” assured Eragon, getting up.
Solembum jumped off Angela’s lap as she stood. “Good!” she exclaimed.
Eragon said farewell and left the room. Solembum guided him back to the dragonhold, then dismissed
him with a twitch of his tail before sauntering away.
HALL OF THEMOUNTAINKING
Adwarf was waiting for Eragon in the dragonhold. After bowing and muttering, “Argetlam,” the dwarf
said with a thick accent, “Good. Awake. Knurla Orik waits for you.” He bowed again and scurried
away. Saphira jumped out of her cave, landing next to Eragon. Zar’roc was in her claws.
What’s that for?he asked, frowning.
She tilted her head.Wear it. You are a Rider and should bear a Rider’s sword. Zar’roc may have a
bloody history, but that should not shape your actions. Forge a new history for it, and carry it with pride.
Are you sure? Remember Ajihad’s counsel.
Saphira snorted, and a puff of smoke rose from her nostrils.Wear it, Eragon. If you wish to remain

Page 261

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

above the forces here, do not let anyone’s disapproval dictate your actions.
As you wish,he said reluctantly, buckling on the sword. He clambered onto her back, and Saphira flew
out of Tronjheim. There was enough light in Farthen Dûr now that the hazy mass of the crater walls—five
miles away in each direction—was visible. While they spiraled down to the city-mountain’s base, Eragon
told Saphira about his meeting with Angela.
As soon as they landed by one of Tronjheim’s gates, Orik ran to Saphira’s side. “My king, Hrothgar,
wishes to see both of you. Dismount quickly. We must hurry.”
Eragon trotted after the dwarf into Tronjheim. Saphira easily kept pace beside them. Ignoring stares
from people within the soaring corridor, Eragon asked, “Where will we meet Hrothgar?”
Without slowing, Orik said, “In the throne room beneath the city. It will be a private audience as an act
of otho—of ‘faith.’ You do not have to address him in any special manner, but speak to him respectfully.
Hrothgar is quick to anger, but he is wise and sees keenly into the minds of men, so think carefully before
you speak.”
Once they entered Tronjheim’s central chamber, Orik led the way to one of the two descending
stairways that flanked the opposite hall. They started down the right-hand staircase, which gently curved
inward until it faced the direction they had come from. The other stairway merged with theirs to form a
broad cascade of dimly lit steps that ended, after a hundred feet, before two granite doors. A
seven-pointed crown was carved across both doors.
Seven dwarves stood guard on each side of the portal. They held burnished mattocks and wore
gem-encrusted belts. As Eragon, Orik, and Saphira approached, the dwarves pounded the floor with the
mattocks’ hafts. A deep boom rolled back up the stairs. The doors swung inward.
A dark hall lay before them, a good bowshot long. The throne room was a natural cave; the walls were
lined with stalagmites and stalactites, each thicker than a man. Sparsely hung lanterns cast a moody light.
The brown floor was smooth and polished. At the far end of the hall was a black throne with a
motionless figure upon it.
Orik bowed. “The king awaits you.” Eragon put his hand on Saphira’s side, and the two of them
continued forward. The doors closed behind them, leaving them alone in the dim throne room with the
king.
Their footsteps echoed through the hall as they advanced toward the throne. In the recesses between the
stalagmites and stalactites rested large statues. Each sculpture depicted a dwarf king crowned and sitting
on a throne; their sightless eyes gazed sternly into the distance, their lined faces set in fierce expressions.
A name was chiseled in runes beneath each set of feet.
Eragon and Saphira strode solemnly between the two rows of long-dead monarchs. They passed more
than forty statues, then only dark and empty alcoves awaiting future kings. They stopped before Hrothgar
at the end of the hall.
The dwarf king himself sat like a statue upon a raised throne carved from a single piece of black marble.
It was blocky, unadorned, and cut with unyielding precision. Strength emanated from the throne, strength
that harked back to ancient times when dwarves had ruled in Alagaësia without opposition from elves or
humans. A gold helm lined with rubies and diamonds rested on Hrothgar’s head in place of a crown. His
visage was grim, weathered, and hewn of many years’ experience. Beneath a craggy brow glinted

Page 262

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

deep-set eyes, flinty and piercing. Over his powerful chest rippled a shirt of mail. His white beard was
tucked under his belt, and in his lap he held a mighty war hammer with the symbol of Orik’s clan
embossed on its head.
Eragon bowed awkwardly and knelt. Saphira remained upright. The king stirred, as if awakening from a
long sleep, and rumbled, “Rise, Rider, you need not pay tribute to me.”
Straightening, Eragon met Hrothgar’s impenetrable eyes. The king inspected him with a hard gaze, then
said gutturally, “Âz knurl deimi lanok.‘Beware, the rock changes’—an old dictum of ours… And
nowadays the rock changes very fast indeed.” He fingered the war hammer. “I could not meet with you
earlier, as Ajihad did, because I was forced to deal with my enemies within the clans. They demanded
that I deny you sanctuary and expel you from Farthen Dûr. It has taken much work on my part to
convince them otherwise.”
“Thank you,” said Eragon. “I didn’t anticipate how much strife my arrival would cause.”
The king accepted his thanks, then lifted a gnarled hand and pointed. “See there, Rider Eragon, where
my predecessors sit upon their graven thrones. One and forty there are, with I the forty-second. When I
pass from this world into the care of the gods, my hírna will be added to their ranks. The first statue is the
likeness of my ancestor Korgan, who forged this mace, Volund. For eight millennia—since the dawn of
our race—dwarves have ruled under Farthen Dûr. We are the bones of the land, older than both the fair
elves and the savage dragons.” Saphira shifted slightly.
Hrothgar leaned forward, his voice gravelly and deep. “I am old, human—even by our reckoning—old
enough to have seen the Riders in all their fleeting glory, old enough to have spoken with their last leader,
Vrael, who paid tribute to me within these very walls. Few are still alive who can claim that much. I
remember the Riders and how they meddled in our affairs. I also remember the peace they kept that
made it possible to walk unharmed from Tronjheim to Narda.
“And now you stand before me—a lost tradition revived. Tell me, and speak truly in this, why have you
come to Farthen Dûr? I know of the events that made you flee the Empire, but what is your intent now?”
“For now, Saphira and I merely want to recuperate in Tronjheim,” Eragon replied. “We are not here to
cause trouble, only to find sanctuary from the dangers we’ve faced for many months. Ajihad may send us
to the elves, but until he does, we have no wish to leave.”
“Then was it only the desire for safety that drove you?” asked Hrothgar. “Do you just seek to live here
and forget your troubles with the Empire?”
Eragon shook his head, his pride rejecting that statement. “If Ajihad told you of my past, you should
know that I have grievances enough to fight the Empire until it is nothing but scattered ashes. More than
that, though… I want to aid those who cannot escape Galbatorix, including my cousin. I have the strength
to help, so I must.”
The king seemed satisfied by his answer. He turned to Saphira and asked, “Dragon, what think you in
this matter? For what reason have you come?”
Saphira lifted the edge of her lip to growl.Tell him that I thirst for the blood of our enemies and eagerly
await the day when we ride to battle against Galbatorix. I’ve no love or mercy for traitors and egg
breakers like that false king. He held me for over a century and, even now, still has two of my brethren,
whom I would free if possible. And tell Hrothgar I think you ready for this task.

Eragon grimaced at her words, but dutifully relayed them. The corner of Hrothgar’s mouth lifted in a hint
of grim amusement, deepening his wrinkles. “I see that dragons have not changed with the centuries.” He
rapped the throne with a knuckle. “Do you know why this seat was quarried so flat and angular? So that
no one would sit comfortably on it. I have not, and will relinquish it without regret when my time comes.
What is there to remind you of your obligations, Eragon? If the Empire falls, will you take Galbatorix’s
place and claim his kingship?”
“I don’t seek to wear the crown or rule,” said Eragon, troubled. “Being a Rider is responsibility enough.
No, I would not take the throne in Urû’baen… not unless there was no one else willing or competent
enough to take it.”
Hrothgar warned gravely, “Certainly you would be a kinder king than Galbatorix, but no race should
have a leader who does not age or leave the throne. The time of the Riders has passed, Eragon. They will
never rise again—not even if Galbatorix’s other eggs were to hatch.”
A shadow crossed his face as he gazed at Eragon’s side. “I see that you carry an enemy’s sword; I was
told of this, and that you travel with a son of the Forsworn. It does not please me to see this weapon.”
He extended a hand. “I would like to examine it.”
Eragon drew Zar’roc and presented it to the king, hilt first. Hrothgar grasped the sword and ran a
practiced eye over the red blade. The edge caught the lantern light, reflecting it sharply. The dwarf king
tested the point with his palm, then said, “A masterfully forged blade. Elves rarely choose to make
swords—they prefer bows and spears—but when they do, the results are unmatched. This is an ill-fated
blade; I am not glad to see it within my realm. But carry it if you will; perhaps its luck has changed.” He
returned Zar’roc, and Eragon sheathed it. “Has my nephew proved helpful during your time here?”
“Who?”
Hrothgar raised a tangled eyebrow. “Orik, my youngest sister’s son. He’s been serving under Ajihad to
show my support for the Varden. It seems that he has been returned to my command, however. I was
gratified to hear that you defended him with your words.”
Eragon understood that this was another sign of otho, of “faith,” on Hrothgar’s part. “I couldn’t ask for a
better guide.”
“That is good,” said the king, clearly pleased. “Unfortunately, I cannot speak with you much longer. My
advisors wait for me, as there are matters I must deal with. I will say this, though: If you wish the support
of the dwarves within my realm, you must first prove yourself to them. We have long memories and do
not rush to hasty decisions. Words will decide nothing, only deeds.”
“I will keep that in mind,” said Eragon, bowing again.
Hrothgar nodded regally. “You may go, then.”
Eragon turned with Saphira, and they proceeded out of the hall of the mountain king. Orik was waiting
for them on the other side of the stone doors, an anxious expression on his face. He fell in with them as
they climbed back up to Tronjheim’s main chamber. “Did all go well? Were you received favorably?”
“I think so. But your king is cautious,” said Eragon.

“That is how he has survived this long.”
I would not want Hrothgar angry at us,observed Saphira.
Eragon glanced at her.No, I wouldn’t either. I’m not sure what he thought of you—he seems to
disapprove of dragons, though he didn’t say it outright.
That seemed to amuse Saphira.In that he is wise, especially since he’s barely knee-high to me.
In Tronjheim’s center, under the sparkling Isidar Mithrim, Orik said, “Your blessing yesterday has
stirred up the Varden like an overturned beehive. The child Saphira touched has been hailed as a future
hero. She and her guardian have been quartered in the finest rooms. Everyone is talking about your
‘miracle.’ All the human mothers seem intent on finding you and getting the same for their children.”
Alarmed, Eragon furtively looked around. “What should we do?”
“Aside from taking back your actions?” asked Orik dryly. “Stay out of sight as much as possible.
Everyone will be kept out of the dragonhold, so you won’t be disturbed there.”
Eragon did not want to return to the dragonhold yet. It was early in the day, and he wanted to explore
Tronjheim with Saphira. Now that they were out of the Empire, there was no reason for them to be
apart. But he wanted to avoid attention, which would be impossible with her at his side.Saphira, what do
you want to do?
She nosed him, scales brushing his arm.I’ll return to the dragonhold. There’s someone there I want to
meet. Wander around as long as you like.
All right,he said,but who do you want to meet?Saphira only winked a large eye at him before padding
down one of Tronjheim’s four main tunnels.
Eragon explained to Orik where she was going, then said, “I’d like some breakfast. And then I’d like to
see more of Tronjheim; it’s such an incredible place. I don’t want to go to the training grounds until
tomorrow, as I’m still not fully recovered.”
Orik nodded, his beard bobbing on his chest. “In that case, would you like to visit Tronjheim’s library?
It’s quite old and contains many scrolls of great value. You might find it interesting to read a history of
Alagaësia that hasn’t been tainted by Galbatorix’s hand.”
With a pang, Eragon remembered how Brom had taught him to read. He wondered if he still had the
skill. A long time had passed since he had seen any written words. “Yes, let’s do that.”
“Very well.”
After they ate, Orik guided Eragon through myriad corridors to their destination. When they reached the
library’s carved arch, Eragon stepped through it reverently.
The room reminded him of a forest. Rows of graceful colonnades branched up to the dark, ribbed
ceiling five stories above. Between the pillars, black-marble bookcases stood back to back. Racks of
scrolls covered the walls, interspersed with narrow walkways reached by three twisting staircases.
Placed at regular intervals around the walls were pairs of facing stone benches. Between them were small
tables whose bases flowed seamlessly into the floor.

Page 265

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Countless books and scrolls were stored in the room. “This is the true legacy of our race,” said Orik.
“Here reside the writings of our greatest kings and scholars, from antiquity to the present. Also recorded
are the songs and stories composed by our artisans. This library may be our most precious possession. It
isn’t all our work, though—there are human writings here as well. Yours is a short-lived—but
prolific—race. We have little or nothing of the elves’. They guard their secrets jealously.”
“How long may I stay?” asked Eragon, moving toward the shelves.
“As long as you want. Come to me if you have any questions.”
Eragon browsed through the volumes with delight, reaching eagerly for those with interesting titles or
covers. Surprisingly, dwarves used the same runes to write as humans. He was somewhat disheartened
by how hard reading was after months of neglect. He skipped from book to book, slowly working his
way deep into the vast library. Eventually he became immersed in a translation of poems by Dóndar, the
tenth dwarf king.
As he scanned the graceful lines, unfamiliar footsteps approached from behind the bookcase. The sound
startled him, but he berated himself for being silly—he could not be the only person in the library. Even
so, he quietly replaced the book and slipped away, senses alert for danger. He had been ambushed too
many times to ignore such feelings. He heard the footsteps again; only now there were two sets of them.
Apprehensive, he darted across an opening, trying to remember exactly where Orik was sitting. He
sidestepped around a corner and started as he found himself face to face with the Twins.
The Twins stood together, their shoulders meeting, a blank expression on their smooth faces. Their black
snake eyes bored into him. Their hands, hidden within the folds of their purple robes, twitched slightly.
They both bowed, but the movement was insolent and derisive.
“We have been searching for you,” one said. His voice was uncomfortably like the Ra’zac’s.
Eragon suppressed a shiver. “What for?” He reached out with his mind and contacted Saphira. She
immediately joined thoughts with him.
“Ever since you met with Ajihad, we have wanted to… apologize for our actions.” The words were
mocking, but not in a way Eragon could challenge. “We have come to pay homage to you.” Eragon
flushed angrily as they bowed again.
Careful!warned Saphira.
He pushed back his rising temper. He could not afford to be riled by this confrontation. An idea came to
him, and he said with a small smile, “Nay, it is I who pay homage to you. Without your approval I never
could have gained entrance to Farthen Dûr.” He bowed to them in turn, making the movement as insulting
as he could.
There was a flicker of irritation in the Twins’ eyes, but they smiled and said, “We are honored that one
so… important… as yourself thinks so highly of us. We are in your debt for your kind words.”
Now it was Eragon’s turn to be irritated. “I will remember that when I’m in need.”
Saphira intruded sharply in his thoughts.You’re overdoing it. Don’t say anything you’ll regret. They will
remember every word they can use against you.

Page 266

This is difficult enough without you making comments!he snapped. She subsided with an exasperated
grumble.
The Twins moved closer, the hems of their robes brushing softly over the floor. Their voices became
more pleasant. “We have searched for you for another reason as well, Rider. The few magic users who
live in Tronjheim have formed a group. We call ourselves Du Vrangr Gata, or the—”
“The Wandering Path, I know,” interrupted Eragon, remembering what Angela had said about it.
“Your knowledge of the ancient language is impressive,” said a Twin smoothly. “As we were saying, Du
Vrangr Gata has heard of your mighty feats, and we have come to extend an invitation of membership.
We would be honored to have one of your stature as a member. And I suspect that we might be able to
assist you as well.”
“How?”
The other Twin said, “The two of us have garnered much experience in magical matters. We could guide
you… show you spells we’ve discovered and teach you words of power. Nothing would gladden us
more than if we could assist, in some small way, your path to glory. No repayment would be necessary,
though if you saw fit to share some scraps of your own knowledge, we would be satisfied.”
Eragon’s face hardened as he realized what they were asking for. “Do you think I’m a half-wit?” he
demanded harshly. “I won’t apprentice myself to you so you can learn the words Brom taught me! It
must have angered you when you couldn’t steal them from my mind.”
The Twins abruptly dropped their facade of smiles. “We are not to be trifled with, boy! We are the ones
who will test your abilities with magic. And that could bemost unpleasant. Remember, it only takes one
misconceived spell to kill someone. You may be a Rider, but the two of us are still stronger than you.”
Eragon kept his face expressionless, even as his stomach knotted painfully. “I will consider your offer,
but it may—”
“Then we will expect your answer tomorrow. Make sure that it is the right one.” They smiled coldly and
stalked deeper into the library.
Eragon scowled.I’m not going to join Du Vrangr Gata, no matter what they do.
You should talk to Angela,said Saphira.She’s dealt with the Twins before. Perhaps she could be there
when they test you. That might prevent them from harming you.
That’s a good idea.Eragon wound through the bookcases until he found Orik sitting on a bench, busily
polishing his war ax. “I’d like to return to the dragonhold.”
The dwarf slid the haft of the ax through a leather loop at his belt, then escorted Eragon to the gate
where Saphira waited. People had already gathered around her. Ignoring them, Eragon scrambled onto
Saphira’s back, and they escaped to the sky.
This problem must be resolved quickly. You cannot let the Twins intimidate you,Saphira said as she
landed on Isidar Mithrim.

I know. But I hope we can avoid angering them. They could be dangerous enemies.He dismounted
quickly, keeping a hand on Zar’roc.
So can you. Do you want them as allies?
He shook his head.Not really… I’ll tell them tomorrow that I won’t join Du Vrangr Gata.
Eragon left Saphira in her cave and wandered out of the dragonhold. He wanted to see Angela, but he
didn’t remember how to find her hiding place, and Solembum was not there to guide him. He roamed the
deserted corridors, hoping to meet Angela by chance.
When he grew tired of staring at empty rooms and endless gray walls, he retraced his footsteps to the
hold. As he neared it, he heard someone speaking within the room. He halted and listened, but the clear
voice fell silent.Saphira? Who’s in there?
A female… She has an air of command. I’ll distract her while you come in.Eragon loosened Zar’roc in
its sheath.Orik said that intruders would be kept out of the dragonhold, so who could this be? He
steadied his nerves, then stepped into the hold, his hand on the sword.
A young woman stood in the center of the room, looking curiously at Saphira, who had stuck her head
out of the cave. The woman appeared to be about seventeen years old. The star sapphire cast a rosy
light on her, accentuating skin the same deep shade as Ajihad’s. Her velvet dress was wine red and
elegantly cut. A jeweled dagger, worn with use, hung from her waist in a tooled leather sheath.
Eragon crossed his arms, waiting for the woman to notice him. She continued to look at Saphira, then
curtsied and asked sweetly, “Please, could you tell me where Rider Eragon is?” Saphira’s eyes sparkled
with amusement.
With a small smile, Eragon said, “I am here.”
The woman whirled to face him, hand flying to her dagger. Her face was striking, with almond-shaped
eyes, wide lips, and round cheekbones. She relaxed and curtsied again. “I am Nasuada,” she said.
Eragon inclined his head. “You obviously know who I am, but what do you want?”
Nasuada smiled charmingly. “My father, Ajihad, sent me here with a message. Would you like to hear
it?”
The Varden’s leader had not struck Eragon as one inclined to marriage and fatherhood. He wondered
who Nasuada’s mother was—she must have been an uncommon woman to have attracted Ajihad’s eye.
“Yes, I would.”
Nasuada tossed her hair back and recited: “He is pleased that you are doing well, but he cautions you
against actions like your benediction yesterday. They create more problems than they solve. Also, he
urges you to proceed with the testing as soon as possible—he needs to know how capable you are
before he communicates with the elves.”
“Did you climb all the way up here just to tell me that?” Eragon asked, thinking of Vol Turin’s length.
Nasuada shook her head. “I used the pulley system that transports goods to the upper levels. We could
have sent the message with signals, but I decided to bring it myself and meet you in person.”

Page 268

“Would you like to sit down?” asked Eragon. He motioned toward Saphira’s cave.
Nasuada laughed lightly. “No, I am expected elsewhere. You should also know, my father decreed that
you may visit Murtagh, if you wish.” A somber expression disturbed her previously smooth features. “I
met Murtagh earlier… He’s anxious to speak with you. He seemed lonely; you should visit him.” She
gave Eragon directions to Murtagh’s cell.
Eragon thanked her for the news, then asked, “What about Arya? Is she better? Can I see her? Orik
wasn’t able to tell me much.”
She smiled mischievously. “Arya is recovering swiftly, as all elves do. No one is allowed to see her
except my father, Hrothgar, and the healers. They have spent much time with her, learning all that
occurred during her imprisonment.” She swept her eyes over Saphira. “I must go now. Is there anything
you would have me convey to Ajihad on your behalf?”
“No, except a desire to visit Arya. And give him my thanks for the hospitality he’s shown us.”
“I will take your words directly to him. Farewell, Rider Eragon. I hope we shall soon meet again.” She
curtsied and exited the dragonhold, head held high.
If she really came all the way up Tronjheim just to meet me—pulleys or no pulleys—there was more to
this meeting than idle chatter,remarked Eragon.
Aye,said Saphira, withdrawing her head into the cave. Eragon climbed up to her and was surprised to
see Solembum curled up in the hollow at the base of her neck. The werecat was purring deeply, his
black-tipped tail flicking back and forth. The two of them looked at Eragon impudently, as if to ask,
“What?”
Eragon shook his head, laughing helplessly.Saphira, is Solembum who you wanted to meet?
They both blinked at him and answered,Yes.
Just wondering,he said, mirth still bubbling inside him. It made sense that they would befriend each
other—their personalities were similar, and they were both creatures of magic. He sighed, releasing some
of the day’s tension as he unbuckled Zar’roc.Solembum, do you know where Angela is? I couldn’t find
her, and I need her advice.
Solembum kneaded his paws against Saphira’s scaled back.She is somewhere in Tronjheim.
When will she return?
Soon.
How soon?he asked impatiently.I need to talk to her today.
Not that soon.
The werecat refused to say more, despite Eragon’s persistent questions. He gave up and nestled against
Saphira. Solembum’s purring was a low thrum above his head.I have to visit Murtagh tomorrow, he
thought, fingering Brom’s ring.

ARYA’STEST
On the morning of their third day in Tronjheim, Eragon rolled out of bed refreshed and energized. He
belted Zar’roc to his waist and slung his bow and half-full quiver across his back. After a leisurely flight
inside Farthen Dûr with Saphira, he met Orik by one of Tronjheim’s four main gates. Eragon asked him
about Nasuada.
“An unusual girl,” answered Orik, glancing disapprovingly at Zar’roc. “She’s totally devoted to her
father and spends all her time helping him. I think she does more for Ajihad than he knows—there have
been times when she’s maneuvered his enemies without ever revealing her part in it.”
“Who is her mother?”
“That I don’t know. Ajihad was alone when he brought Nasuada to Farthen Dûr as a newborn child.
He’s never said where he and Nasuada came from.”
So she too grew up without knowing her mother.He shook off the thought. “I’m restless. It’ll be good to
use my muscles. Where should I go for this ‘testing’ of Ajihad’s?”
Orik pointed out into Farthen Dûr. “The training field is half a mile from Tronjheim, though you can’t see
it from here because it’s behind the city-mountain. It’s a large area where both dwarves and humans
practice.”
I’m coming as well,stated Saphira.
Eragon told Orik, and the dwarf tugged on his beard. “That might not be a good idea. There are many
people at the training field; you will be sure to attract attention.”
Saphira growled loudly.I will come! And that settled the matter.

The unruly clatter of fighting reached them from the field: the loud clang of steel clashing on steel, the
solid thump of arrows striking padded targets, the rattle and crack of wooden staves, and the shouts of
men in mock battle. The noise was confusing, yet each group had a unique rhythm and pattern.
The bulk of the training ground was occupied by a crooked block of foot soldiers struggling with shields
and poleaxes nearly as tall as themselves. They drilled as a group in formations. Practicing beside them
were hundreds of individual warriors outfitted with swords, maces, spears, staves, flails, shields of all
shapes and sizes, and even, Eragon saw, someone with a pitchfork. Nearly all the fighters wore armor,
usually chain mail and a helmet; plate armor was not as common. There were as many dwarves as
humans, though the two kept mainly to themselves. Behind the sparring warriors, a broad line of archers
fired steadily at gray sackcloth dummies.
Before Eragon had time to wonder what he was supposed to do, a bearded man, his head and blocky
shoulders covered by a mail coif, strode over to them. The rest of him was protected by a rough oxhide
suit that still had hair on it. A huge sword—almost as long as Eragon—hung across his broad back. He
ran a quick eye over Saphira and Eragon, as if evaluating how dangerous they were, then said gruffly,
“Knurla Orik. You’ve been gone too long. There’s nobody left for me to spar with.”

Page 270

Orik smiled. “Oeí, that’s because you bruise everyone from head to toe with your monster sword.”
“Everyone except you,” he corrected.
“That’s because I’m faster than a giant like you.”
The man looked at Eragon again. “I’m Fredric. I’ve been told to find out what you can do. How strong
are you?”
“Strong enough,” answered Eragon. “I have to be in order to fight with magic.”
Fredric shook his head; the coif clinked like a bag of coins. “Magic has no place in what we do here.
Unless you’ve served in an army, I doubt any fights you’ve been in lasted more than a few minutes. What
we’re concerned about is how you’ll be able to hold up in a battle that may drag on for hours, or even
weeks if it’s a siege. Do you know how to use any weapons besides that sword and bow?”
Eragon thought about it. “Only my fists.”
“Good answer!” laughed Fredric. “Well, we’ll start you off with the bow and see how you do. Then
once some space has cleared up on the field, we’ll try—” He broke off suddenly and stared past Eragon,
scowling angrily.
The Twins stalked toward them, their bald heads pale against their purple robes. Orik muttered
something in his own language as he slipped his war ax out of his belt. “I told you two to stay away from
the training area,” said Fredric, stepping forward threateningly. The Twins seemed frail before his bulk.
They looked at him arrogantly. “We were ordered by Ajihad to test Eragon’s proficiency with magic—
beforeyou exhaust him banging on pieces of metal.”
Fredric glowered. “Why can’t someone else test him?”
“No one else is powerful enough,” sniffed the Twins. Saphira rumbled deeply and glared at them. A line
of smoke trickled from her nostrils, but they ignored her. “Come with us,” they ordered, and strode to an
empty corner of the field.
Shrugging, Eragon followed with Saphira. Behind him he heard Fredric say to Orik, “We have to stop
them from going too far.”
“I know,” answered Orik in a low voice, “but I can’t interfere again. Hrothgar made it clear he won’t be
able to protect me the next time it happens.”
Eragon forced back his growing apprehension. The Twins might know more techniques and words…
Still, he remembered what Brom had told him: Riders were stronger in magic than ordinary men. But
would that be enough to resist the combined power of the Twins?
Don’t worry so much; I will help you,said Saphira.There are two of us as well.
He touched her gently on the leg, relieved by her words. The Twins looked at Eragon and asked, “And
how do you answer us, Eragon?”
Overlooking the puzzled expressions of his companions, he said flatly, “No.”

Page 271

Sharp lines appeared at the corners of the Twins’ mouths. They turned so they faced Eragon obliquely
and, bending at the waists, drew a large pentagram on the ground. They stepped in the middle of it, then
said harshly, “We begin now. You will attempt to complete the tasks we assign you… that is all.”
One of the Twins reached into his robe, produced a polished rock the size of Eragon’s fist, and set it on
the ground. “Lift it to eye level.”
That’s easy enough,commented Eragon to Saphira. “Stenr reisa!” The rock wobbled, then smoothly
rose from the ground. Before it went more than a foot, an unexpected resistance halted it in midair. A
smile touched the Twins’ lips. Eragon stared at them, enraged—they were trying to make him fail! If he
became exhausted now, it would be impossible to complete the harder tasks. Obviously they were
confident that their combined strength could easily wear him down.
But I’m not alone either,snarled Eragon to himself.Saphira, now! Her mind melded with his, and the rock
jerked through the air to stop, quivering, at eye level. The Twins’ eyes narrowed cruelly.
“Very… good,” they hissed. Fredric looked unnerved by the display of magic. “Now move the stone in
a circle.” Again Eragon struggled against their efforts to stop him, and again—to their obvious anger—he
prevailed. The exercises quickly increased in complexity and difficulty until Eragon was forced to think
carefully about which words to use. And each time, the Twins fought him bitterly, though the strain never
showed on their faces.
It was only with Saphira’s support that Eragon was able to hold his ground. In a break between two of
the tasks, he asked her,Why do they continue this testing? Our abilities were clear enough from what they
saw in my mind.She cocked her head thoughtfully.You know what? he said grimly as comprehension
came to him.They’re using this as an opportunity to figure out what ancient words I know and perhaps
learn new ones themselves.
Speak softly then, so that they cannot hear you, and use the simplest words possible.
From then on, Eragon used only a handful of basic words to complete the tasks. But finding ways to
make them perform in the same manner as a long sentence or phrase stretched his ingenuity to the limit.
He was rewarded by the frustration that contorted the Twins’ faces as he foiled them again and again.
No matter what they tried, they could not get him to use any more words in the ancient language.
More than an hour passed, but the Twins showed no sign of stopping. Eragon was hot and thirsty, but
refrained from asking for a reprieve—he would continue as long as they did. There were many tests:
manipulating water, casting fire, scrying, juggling rocks, hardening leather, freezing items, controlling the
flight of an arrow, and healing scratches. He wondered how long it would take for the Twins to run out of
ideas.
Finally the Twins raised their hands and said, “There is only one thing left to do. It is simple enough—any
competent user of magic should find this easy.” One of them removed a silver ring from his finger and
smugly handed it to Eragon. “Summon the essence of silver.”
Eragon stared at the ring in confusion. What was he supposed to do? The essence of silver, what was
that? And how was it to be summoned? Saphira had no idea, and the Twins were not going to help. He
had never learned silver’s name in the ancient language, though he knew it had to be part ofargetlam. In
desperation he combined the only word that might work,ethgrí,or “invoke,” witharget.

Page 272

Drawing himself upright, he gathered together what power he had left and parted his lips to deliver the
invocation. Suddenly a clear, vibrant voice split the air.
“Stop!”
The word rushed over Eragon like cool water—the voice was strangely familiar, like a half-remembered
melody. The back of his neck tingled. He slowly turned toward its source.
A lone figure stood behind them: Arya. A leather strip encircled her brow, restraining her voluminous
black hair, which tumbled behind her shoulders in a lustrous cascade. Her slender sword was at her hip,
her bow on her back. Plain black leather clothed her shapely frame, poor raiment for one so fair. She
was taller than most men, and her stance was perfectly balanced and relaxed. An unmarked face
reflected none of the horrific abuse she had endured.
Arya’s blazing emerald eyes were fixed on the Twins, who had turned pale with fright. She approached
on silent footsteps and said in soft, menacing tones, “Shame! Shame to ask of him what only a master can
do. Shame that you should use such methods. Shame that you told Ajihad you didn’t know Eragon’s
abilities. He is competent. Now leave!” Arya frowned dangerously, her slanted eyebrows meeting like
lightning bolts in a sharp V, and pointed at the ring in Eragon’s hand. “Arget!” she exclaimed
thunderously.
The silver shimmered, and a ghostly image of the ring materialized next to it. The two were identical
except that the apparition seemed purer and glowed white-hot. At the sight of it, the Twins spun on their
heels and fled, robes flapping wildly. The insubstantial ring vanished from Eragon’s hand, leaving the
circlet of silver behind. Orik and Fredric were on their feet, eyeing Arya warily. Saphira crouched, ready
for action.
The elf surveyed them all. Her angled eyes paused on Eragon. Then she turned and strode toward the
heart of the training field. The warriors ceased their sparring and looked at her with wonder. Within a few
moments the entire field fell silent in awe of her presence.
Eragon was inexorably dragged forward by his own fascination. Saphira spoke, but he was oblivious to
her comments. A large circle formed around Arya. Looking only at Eragon, she proclaimed, “I claim the
right of trial by arms. Draw your sword.”
She means to duel me!
But not, I think, to harm you,replied Saphira slowly. She nudged him with her nose.Go and acquit
yourself well. I will watch.
Eragon reluctantly stepped forward. He did not want to do this when he was exhausted from magic use
and when there were so many people watching. Besides, Arya could be in no shape for sparring. It had
only been two days since she had received Túnivor’s Nectar.I will soften my blows so I don’t hurt her,
he decided.
They faced each other across the circle of warriors. Arya drew her sword with her left hand. The
weapon was thinner than Eragon’s, but just as long and sharp. He slid Zar’roc out of its polished sheath
and held the red blade point-down by his side. For a long moment they stood motionless, elf and human
watching each other. It flashed through Eragon’s mind that this was how many of his fights with Brom had
started.

He moved forward cautiously. With a blur of motion Arya jumped at him, slashing at his ribs. Eragon
reflexively parried the attack, and their swords met in a shower of sparks. Zar’roc was batted aside as if
it were no more than a fly. The elf did not take advantage of the opening, however, but spun to her right,
hair whipping through the air, and struck at his other side. He barely stopped the blow and backpedaled
frantically, stunned by her ferocity and speed.
Belatedly, Eragon remembered Brom’s warning that even the weakest elf could easily overpower a
human. He had about as much chance of defeating Arya as he did Durza. She attacked again, swinging at
his head. He ducked under the razor-sharp edge. But then why was she…toying with him? For a few
long seconds he was too busy warding her off to think about it, then he realized,She wants to know how
proficient I am.
Understanding that, he began the most complicated series of attacks he knew. He flowed from one pose
to another, recklessly combining and modifying them in every possible way. But no matter how inventive
he was, Arya’s sword always stopped his. She matched his actions with effortless grace.
Engaged in a fiery dance, their bodies were linked and separated by the flashing blades. At times they
nearly touched, taut skin only a hair’s breadth away, but then momentum would whirl them apart, and
they would withdraw for a second, only to join again. Their sinuous forms wove together like twisting
ropes of windblown smoke.
Eragon could never remember how long they fought. It was timeless, filled with nothing but action and
reaction. Zar’roc grew leaden in his hand; his arm burned ferociously with each stroke. At last, as he
lunged forward, Arya nimbly sidestepped, sweeping the point of her sword up to his jawbone with
supernatural speed.
Eragon froze as the icy metal touched his skin. His muscles trembled from the exertion. Dimly he heard
Saphira bugle and the warriors cheering raucously around them. Arya lowered her sword and sheathed
it. “You have passed,” she said quietly amid the noise.
Dazed, he slowly straightened. Fredric was beside him now, thumping his back enthusiastically. “That
was incredible swordsmanship! I even learned some new moves from watching the two of you. And the
elf—stunning!”
But I lost,he protested silently. Orik praised his performance with a broad smile, but all Eragon noticed
was Arya, standing alone and silent. She motioned slightly with a finger, no more than a twitch, toward a
knoll about a mile from the practice field, then turned and walked away. The crowd melted before her. A
hush fell over the men and dwarves as she passed.
Eragon turned to Orik. “I have to go. I’ll return to the dragonhold soon.” With a swift jab, Eragon
sheathed Zar’roc and pulled himself onto Saphira. She took off over the training field, which turned into a
sea of faces as everyone looked at her.
As they soared toward the knoll, Eragon saw Arya running below them with clean, easy strides. Saphira
commented,You find her form pleasing, do you not?
Yes,he admitted, blushing.
Her face does have more character than that of most humans,she sniffed.But it’s long, like a horse’s, and
overall she’s rather shapeless.

Page 274

Eragon looked at Saphira with amazement.You’re jealous, aren’t you!
Impossible. I never get jealous,she said, offended.
You are now, admit it!he laughed.
She snapped her jaws together loudly.I am not! He smiled and shook his head, but let her denial stand.
She landed heavily on the knoll, jostling him roughly. He jumped down without remarking on it.
Arya was close behind them. Her fleet stride carried her faster than any runner Eragon had seen. When
she reached the top of the knoll, her breathing was smooth and regular. Suddenly tongue-tied, Eragon
dropped his gaze. She strode past him and said to Saphira, “Skulblaka, eka celöbra ono un mulabra ono
un onr Shur’tugal né haina. Atra nosu waíse fricai.”
Eragon did not recognize most of the words, but Saphira obviously understood the message. She
shuffled her wings and surveyed Arya curiously. Then she nodded, humming deeply. Arya smiled. “I am
glad that you recovered,” Eragon said. “We didn’t know if you would live or not.”
“That is why I came here today,” said Arya, facing him. Her rich voice was accented and exotic. She
spoke clearly, with a hint of trill, as if she were about to sing. “I owe you a debt that must be repaid. You
saved my life. That can never be forgotten.”
“It—it was nothing,” said Eragon, fumbling with the words and knowing they were not true, even as he
spoke them. Embarrassed, he changed the subject. “How did you come to be in Gil’ead?”
Pain shadowed Arya’s face. She looked away into the distance. “Let us walk.” They descended from
the knoll and meandered toward Farthen Dûr. Eragon respected Arya’s silence as they walked. Saphira
padded quietly beside them. Finally Arya lifted her head and said with the grace of her kind, “Ajihad told
me you were present when Saphira’s egg appeared.”
“Yes.” For the first time, Eragon thought about the energy it must have taken to transport the egg over
the dozens of leagues that separated Du Weldenvarden from the Spine. To even attempt such a feat was
courting disaster, if not death.
Her next words were heavy. “Then know this: at the moment you first beheld it, I was captured by
Durza.” Her voice filled with bitterness and grief. “It was he who led the Urgals that ambushed and slew
my companions, Faolin and Glenwing. Somehow he knew where to wait for us—we had no warning. I
was drugged and transported to Gil’ead. There, Durza was charged by Galbatorix to learn where I had
sent the egg and all I knew of Ellesméra.”
She stared ahead icily, jaw clenched. “He tried for months without success. His methods were… harsh.
When torture failed, he ordered his soldiers to use me as they would. Fortunately, I still had the strength
to nudge their minds and make them incapable. At last Galbatorix ordered that I was to be brought to
Urû’baen. Dread filled me when I learned this, as I was weary in both mind and body and had no
strength to resist him. If it were not for you, I would have stood before Galbatorix in a week’s time.”
Eragon shuddered inwardly. It was amazing what she had survived. The memory of her injuries was still
vivid in his mind. Softly, he asked, “Why do you tell me all this?”
“So that you know what I was saved from. Do not presume I can ignore your deed.”

Page 275

Humbled, he bowed his head. “What will you do now—return to Ellesméra?”
“No, not yet. There is much that must be done here. I cannot abandon the Varden—Ajihad needs my
help. I’ve seen you tested in both arms and magic today. Brom taught you well. You are ready to
proceed in your training.”
“You mean for me to go to Ellesméra?”
“Yes.”
Eragon felt a flash of irritation. Did he and Saphira have no say in the matter? “When?”
“That is yet to be decided, but not for some weeks.”
At least they gave us that much time,thought Eragon. Saphira mentioned something to him, and he in turn
asked Arya, “What did the Twins want me to do?”
Arya’s sculpted lip curled with disgust. “Something not even they can accomplish. It is possible to speak
the name of an object in the ancient language and summon its true form. It takes years of work and great
discipline, but the reward is complete control over the object. That is why one’s true name is always kept
hidden, for if it were known by any with evil in their hearts, they could dominate you utterly.”
“It’s strange,” said Eragon after a moment, “but before I was captured at Gil’ead, I had visions of you in
my dreams. It was like scrying—and I was able to scry you later—but it was always during my sleep.”
Arya pursed her lips pensively. “There were times I felt as if another presence was watching me, but I
was often confused and feverish. I’ve never heard of anyone, either in lore or legend, being able to scry
in their sleep.”
“I don’t understand it myself,” said Eragon, looking at his hands. He twirled Brom’s ring around his
finger. “What does the tattoo on your shoulder mean? I didn’t mean to see it, but when I was healing
your wounds… it couldn’t be helped. It’s just like the symbol on this ring.”
“You have a ring with the yawë on it?” she asked sharply.
“Yes. It was Brom’s. See?”
He held out the ring. Arya examined the sapphire, then said, “This is a token given only to the most
valued elf-friends—so valued, in fact, it has not been used in centuries. Or so I thought. I never knew that
Queen Islanzadi thought so highly of Brom.”
“I shouldn’t wear it, then,” said Eragon, afraid that he had been presumptuous.
“No, keep it. It will give you protection if you meet my people by chance, and it may help you gain favor
with the queen. Tell no one of my tattoo. It should not be revealed.”
“Very well.”

He enjoyed talking with Arya and wished their conversation could have lasted longer. When they parted,

Page 276

he wandered through Farthen Dûr, conversing with Saphira. Despite his prodding, she refused to tell him
what Arya had said to her. Eventually his thoughts turned to Murtagh and then to Nasuada’s advice.I’ll
get something to eat, then go see him, he decided.Will you wait for me so I can return to the dragonhold
with you?
I will wait—go,said Saphira.
With a grateful smile, Eragon dashed to Tronjheim, ate in an obscure corner of a kitchen, then followed
Nasuada’s instructions until he reached a small gray door guarded by a man and a dwarf. When he
requested entrance, the dwarf banged on the door three times, then unbolted it. “Just holler when you
want to leave,” said the man with a friendly smile.
The cell was warm and well lit, with a washbasin in one corner and a writing desk—equipped with quills
and ink—in another. The ceiling was extensively carved with lacquered figures; the floor was covered
with a plush rug. Murtagh lay on a stout bed, reading a scroll. He looked up in surprise and exclaimed
cheerily, “Eragon! I’d hoped you would come!”
“How did… I mean I thought—”
“You thought I was stuck in some rat hole chewing on hardtack,” said Murtagh, rolling upright with a
grin. “Actually, I expected the same thing, but Ajihad lets me have all this as long as I don’t cause
trouble. And they bring me huge meals, as well as anything I want from the library. If I’m not careful, I’ll
turn into a fat scholar.”
Eragon laughed, and with a wondering smile seated himself next to Murtagh. “But aren’t you angry?
You’re still a prisoner.”
“Oh, I was at first,” said Murtagh with a shrug. “But the more I thought about it, the more I came to
realize that this is really the best place for me. Even if Ajihad gave me my freedom, I would stay in my
room most of the time anyway.”
“But why?”
“You know well enough. No one would be at ease around me, knowing my true identity, and there
would always be people who wouldn’t limit themselves to harsh looks or words. But enough of that, I’m
eager to know what’s new. Come, tell me.”
Eragon recounted the events of the past two days, including his encounter with the Twins in the library.
When he finished, Murtagh leaned back reflectively. “I suspect,” he said, “that Arya is more important
than either of us thought. Consider what you’ve learned: she is a master of the sword, powerful in magic,
and, most significantly, was chosen to guard Saphira’s egg. She cannot be ordinary, even among the
elves.”
Eragon agreed.
Murtagh stared at the ceiling. “You know, I find this imprisonment oddly peaceful. For once in my life I
don’t have to be afraid. I know I ought to be… yet something about this place puts me at ease. A good
night’s sleep helps, too.”
“I know what you mean,” said Eragon wryly. He moved to a softer place on the bed. “Nasuada said
that she visited you. Did she say anything interesting?”

Page 277

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Murtagh’s gaze shifted into the distance, and he shook his head. “No, she only wanted to meet me.
Doesn’t she look like a princess? And the way she carries herself! When she first entered through that
doorway, I thought she was one of the great ladies of Galbatorix’s court. I’ve seen earls and counts who
had wives that, compared to her, were more fitted for life as a hog than of nobility.”
Eragon listened to his praise with growing apprehension.It may mean nothing, he reminded himself.
You’re leaping to conclusions. Yet the foreboding would not leave him. Trying to shake off the feeling, he
asked, “How long are you going to remain imprisoned, Murtagh? You can’t hide forever.”
Murtagh shrugged carelessly, but there was weight behind his words. “For now I’m content to stay and
rest. There’s no reason for me to seek shelter elsewhere nor submit myself to the Twins’ examination.
No doubt I’ll tire of this eventually, but for now… I am content.”
THESHADOWSLENGTHEN
Saphira woke Eragon with a sharp rap of her snout, bruising him with her hard jaw. “Ouch!” he
exclaimed, sitting upright. The cave was dark except for a faint glow emanating from the shuttered
lantern. Outside in the dragonhold, Isidar Mithrim glittered with a thousand different colors, illuminated by
its girdle of lanterns.
An agitated dwarf stood in the entrance to the cave, wringing his hands. “You must come, Argetlam!
Great trouble—Ajihad summons you. There is no time!”
“What’s wrong?” asked Eragon.
The dwarf only shook his head, beard wagging. “Go, you must! Carkna bragha! Now!”
Eragon belted on Zar’roc, grabbed his bow and arrows, then strapped the saddle onto Saphira.So much
for a good night’s sleep, she groused, crouching low to the floor so he could clamber onto her back. He
yawned loudly as Saphira launched herself from the cave.
Orik was waiting for them with a grim expression when they landed at Tronjheim’s gates. “Come, the
others are waiting.” He led them through Tronjheim to Ajihad’s study. On the way, Eragon plied him with
questions, but Orik would only say, “I don’t know enough myself—wait until you hear Ajihad.”
The large study door was opened by a pair of burly guards. Ajihad stood behind his desk, bleakly
inspecting a map. Arya and a man with wiry arms were there as well. Ajihad looked up. “Good, you’re
here, Eragon. Meet Jörmundur, my second in command.”
They acknowledged each other, then turned their attention to Ajihad. “I roused the five of you because
we are all in grave danger. About half an hour ago a dwarf ran out of an abandoned tunnel under
Tronjheim. He was bleeding and nearly incoherent, but he had enough sense left to tell the dwarves what
was pursuing him: an army of Urgals, maybe a day’s march from here.”
Shocked silence filled the study. Then Jörmundur swore explosively and began asking questions at the
same time Orik did. Arya remained silent. Ajihad raised his hands. “Quiet! There is more. The Urgals
aren’t approachingover land, butunder it. They’re in the tunnels… we’re going to be attacked from
below.”
Eragon raised his voice in the din that followed. “Why didn’t the dwarves know about this sooner? How

Page 278

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

did the Urgals find the tunnels?”
“We’re lucky to know about it this early!” bellowed Orik. Everyone stopped talking to hear him. “There
are hundreds of tunnels throughout the Beor Mountains, uninhabited since the day they were mined. The
only dwarves who go in them are eccentrics who don’t want contact with anyone. We could have just as
easily received no warning at all.”
Ajihad pointed at the map, and Eragon moved closer. The map depicted the southern half of Alagaësia,
but unlike Eragon’s, it showed the entire Beor Mountain range in detail. Ajihad’s finger was on the
section of the Beor Mountains that touched Surda’s eastern border. “This,” he said, “is where the dwarf
claimed to have come from.”
“Orthíad!” exclaimed Orik. At Jörmundur’s puzzled inquiry, he explained, “It’s an ancient dwelling of
ours that was deserted when Tronjheim was completed. During its time it was the greatest of our cities.
But no one’s lived there for centuries.”
“And it’s old enough for some of the tunnels to have collapsed,” said Ajihad. “That’s how we surmise it
was discovered from the surface. I suspect that Orthíad is now being called Ithrö Zhâda. That’s where
the Urgal column that was chasing Eragon and Saphira was supposed to go, and I’m sure it’s where the
Urgals have been migrating all year. From Ithrö Zhâda they can travel anywhere they want in the Beor
Mountains. They have the power to destroy both the Varden and the dwarves.”
Jörmundur bent over the map, eyeing it carefully. “Do you know how many Urgals there are? Are
Galbatorix’s troops with them? We can’t plan a defense without knowing how large their army is.”
Ajihad replied unhappily, “We’re unsure about both those things, yet our survival rests on that last
question. If Galbatorix has augmented the Urgals’ ranks with his own men, we don’t stand a chance. But
if he hasn’t—because he still doesn’t want his alliance with the Urgals revealed, or for some other
reason—it’s possible we can win. Neither Orrin nor the elves can help us at this late hour. Even so, I sent
runners to both of them with news of our plight. At the very least they won’t be caught by surprise if we
fall.”
He drew a hand across his coal-black brow. “I’ve already talked with Hrothgar, and we’ve decided on
a course of action. Our only hope is to contain the Urgals in three of the larger tunnels and channel them
into Farthen Dûr so they don’t swarm inside Tronjheim like locusts.
“I need you, Eragon and Arya, to help the dwarves collapse extraneous tunnels. The job is too big for
normal means. Two groups of dwarves are already working on it: one outside Tronjheim, the other
beneath it. Eragon, you’re to work with the group outside. Arya, you’ll be with the one underground;
Orik will guide you to them.”
“Why not collapse all the tunnels instead of leaving the large ones untouched?” asked Eragon.
“Because,” said Orik, “that would force the Urgals to clear away the rubble, and they might decide to go
in a direction we don’t want them to. Plus, if we cut ourselves off, they could attack other dwarf
cities—which we wouldn’t be able to assist in time.”
“There’s also another reason,” said Ajihad. “Hrothgar warned me that Tronjheim sits on such a dense
network of tunnels that if too many are weakened, sections of the city will sink into the ground under their
own weight. We can’t risk that.”

Page 279

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Jörmundur listened intently, then asked, “So there won’t be any fighting inside Tronjheim? You said the
Urgals would be channeled outside the city, into Farthen Dûr.”
Ajihad responded quickly, “That’s right. We can’t defend Tronjheim’s entire perimeter—it’s too big for
our forces—so we’re going to seal all the passageways and gates leading into it. That will force the
Urgals out onto the flats surrounding Tronjheim, where there’s plenty of maneuvering room for our
armies. Since the Urgals have access to the tunnels, we cannot risk an extended battle. As long as they
are here, we will be in constant danger of them quarrying up through Tronjheim’s floor. If that happens,
we’ll be trapped, attacked from both the outside and inside. We have to prevent the Urgals from taking
Tronjheim. If they secure it, it’s doubtful we will have the strength to roust them.”
“And what of our families?” asked Jörmundur. “I won’t see my wife and son murdered by Urgals.”
The lines deepened on Ajihad’s face. “All the women and children are being evacuated into the
surrounding valleys. If we are defeated, they have guides who will take them to Surda. That’s all I can
do, under the circumstances.”
Jörmundur struggled to hide his relief. “Sir, is Nasuada going as well?”
“She is not pleased, but yes.” All eyes were on Ajihad as he squared his shoulders and announced, “The
Urgals will arrive in a matter of hours. We know their numbers are great, but wemust hold Farthen Dûr.
Failure will mean the dwarves’ downfall, death to the Varden—and eventual defeat for Surda and the
elves. This is one battle we cannot lose. Now go and complete your tasks! Jörmundur, ready the men to
fight.”

They left the study and scattered: Jörmundur to the barracks, Orik and Arya to the stairs leading
underground, and Eragon and Saphira down one of Tronjheim’s four main halls. Despite the early hour,
the city-mountain swarmed like an anthill. People were running, shouting messages, and carrying bundles
of belongings.
Eragon had fought and killed before, but the battle that awaited them sent stabs of fear into his chest. He
had never had a chance to anticipate a fight. Now that he did, it filled him with dread. He was confident
when facing only a few opponents—he knew he could easily defeat three or four Urgals with Zar’roc and
magic—but in a large conflict, anything could happen.
They exited Tronjheim and looked for the dwarves they were supposed to help. Without the sun or
moon, the inside of Farthen Dûr was dark as lampblack, punctuated by glittering lanterns bobbing jerkily
in the crater.Perhaps they’re on the far side of Tronjheim, suggested Saphira. Eragon agreed and swung
onto her back.
They glided around Tronjheim until a clump of lanterns came into sight. Saphira angled toward them,
then with no more than a whisper landed beside a group of startled dwarves who were busy digging with
pickaxes. Eragon quickly explained why he was there. A sharp-nosed dwarf told him, “There’s a tunnel
about four yards directly underneath us. Any help you could give us would be appreciated.”
“If you clear the area over the tunnel, I’ll see what I can do.” The sharp-nosed dwarf looked doubtful,
but ordered the diggers off the site.
Breathing slowly, Eragon prepared to use magic. It might be possible to actually move all the dirt off the

Page 280

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

tunnel, but he needed to conserve his strength for later. Instead, he would try to collapse the tunnel by
applying force to weak sections of its ceiling.
“Thrysta deloi,” he whispered and sent tentacles of power into the soil. Almost immediately they
encountered rock. He ignored it and reached farther down until he felt the hollow emptiness of the tunnel.
Then he began searching for flaws in the rock. Every time he found one, he pushed on it, elongating and
widening it. It was strenuous work, but no more than it would have been to split the stone by hand. He
made no visible progress—a fact that was not lost on the impatient dwarves.
Eragon persevered. Before long he was rewarded by a resounding crack that could be heard clearly on
the surface. There was a persistent screech, then the ground slid inward like water draining from a tub,
leaving a gaping hole seven yards across.
As the delighted dwarves walled off the tunnel with rubble, the sharp-nosed dwarf led Eragon to the next
tunnel. This one was much more difficult to collapse, but he managed to duplicate the feat. Over the next
few hours, he collapsed over a half-dozen tunnels throughout Farthen Dûr, with Saphira’s help.
Light crept into the small patch of sky above them as he worked. It was not enough to see by, but it
bolstered Eragon’s confidence. He turned away from the crumpled ruins of the latest tunnel and surveyed
the land with interest.
A mass exodus of women and children, along with the Varden’s elders, streamed out of Tronjheim.
Everyone carried loads of provisions, clothes, and belongings. A small group of warriors, predominantly
boys and old men, accompanied them.
Most of the activity, however, was at the base of Tronjheim, where the Varden and dwarves were
assembling their army, which was divided into three battalions. Each section bore the Varden’s standard:
a white dragon holding a rose above a sword pointing downward on a purple field.
The men were silent, ironfisted. Their hair flowed loosely from under their helmets. Many warriors had
only a sword and a shield, but there were several ranks of spear- and pikemen. In the rear of the
battalions, archers tested their bowstrings.
The dwarves were garbed in heavy battle gear. Burnished steel hauberks hung to their knees, and thick
round shields, stamped with the crests of their clan, rested on their left arms. Short swords were sheathed
at their waists, while in their right hands they carried mattocks or war axes. Their legs were covered with
extra-fine mail. They wore iron caps and brass-studded boots.
A small figure detached itself from the far battalion and hurried toward Eragon and Saphira. It was Orik,
clad like the other dwarves. “Ajihad wants you to join the army,” he said. “There are no more tunnels to
cave in. Food is waiting for both of you.”
Eragon and Saphira accompanied Orik to a tent, where they found bread and water for Eragon and a
pile of dried meat for Saphira. They ate it without complaint; it was better than going hungry.
When they finished, Orik told them to wait and disappeared into the battalion’s ranks. He returned,
leading a line of dwarves burdened with tall piles of plate armor. Orik lifted a section of it and handed it
to Eragon.
“What is this?” asked Eragon, fingering the polished metal. The armor was intricately wrought with
engraving and gold filigree. It was an inch thick in places and very heavy. No man could fight under that

Page 281

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

much weight. And there were far too many pieces for one person.
“A gift from Hrothgar,” said Orik, looking pleased with himself. “It has lain so long among our other
treasures that it was almost forgotten. It was forged in another age, before the fall of the Riders.”
“But what’s itfor ?” asked Eragon.
“Why, it’s dragon armor, of course! You don’t think that dragons went into battle unprotected?
Complete sets are rare because they took so long to make and because dragons were always growing.
Still, Saphira isn’t too big yet, so this should fit her reasonably well.”
Dragon armor!As Saphira nosed one of the pieces, Eragon asked,What do you think?
Let’s try it on,she said, a fierce gleam in her eye.
After a good deal of struggling, Eragon and Orik stepped back to admire the result. Saphira’s entire
neck—except for the spikes along its ridge—was covered with triangular scales of overlapping armor.
Her belly and chest were protected by the heaviest plates, while the lightest ones were on her tail. Her
legs and back were completely encased. Her wings were left bare. A single molded plate lay on top of
her head, leaving her lower jaw free to bite and snap.
Saphira arched her neck experimentally, and the armor flexed smoothly with her.This will slow me
down, but it’ll help stop the arrows. How do I look?
Very intimidating,replied Eragon truthfully. That pleased her.
Orik picked up the remaining items from the ground. “I brought you armor as well, though it took much
searching to find your size. We rarely forge arms for men or elves. I don’t know who this was made for,
but it has never been used and should serve you well.”
Over Eragon’s head went a stiff shirt of leather-backed mail that fell to his knees like a skirt. It rested
heavily on his shoulders and clinked when he moved. He belted Zar’roc over it, which helped keep the
mail from swinging. On his head went a leather cap, then a mail coif, and finally a gold-and-silver helm.
Bracers were strapped to his forearms, and greaves to his lower legs. For his hands there were
mail-backed gloves. Last, Orik handed him a broad shield emblazoned with an oak tree.
Knowing that what he and Saphira had been given was worth several fortunes, Eragon bowed and said,
“Thank you for these gifts. Hrothgar’s presents are greatly appreciated.”
“Don’t give thanks now,” said Orik with a chuckle. “Wait until the armor saves your life.”
The warriors around them began marching away. The three battalions were repositioning themselves in
different parts of Farthen Dûr. Unsure of what they should do, Eragon looked at Orik, who shrugged and
said, “I suppose we should accompany them.” They trailed behind a battalion as it headed toward the
crater wall. Eragon asked about the Urgals, but Orik only knew that scouts had been posted
underground in the tunnels and that nothing had been seen or heard yet.
The battalion halted at one of the collapsed tunnels. The dwarves had piled the rubble so that anyone
inside the tunnel could easily climb out.This must be one of the places they’re going to force the Urgals to
surface, Saphira pointed out.

Page 282

Hundreds of lanterns were fixed atop poles and stuck into the ground. They provided a great pool of
light that glowed like an evening sun. Fires blazed along the rim of the tunnel’s roof, huge cauldrons of
pitch heating over them. Eragon looked away, fighting back revulsion. It was a terrible way to kill
anyone, even an Urgal.
Rows of sharpened saplings were being pounded into the ground to provide a thorny barrier between
the battalion and the tunnel. Eragon saw an opportunity to help and joined a group of men digging
trenches between the saplings. Saphira assisted as well, scooping out the dirt with her giant claws. While
they labored, Orik left to supervise the construction of a barricade to shield the archers. Eragon drank
gratefully from the wineskin whenever it was passed around. After the trenches were finished and filled
with pointed stakes, Saphira and Eragon rested.
Orik returned to find them seated together. He wiped his brow. “All the men and dwarves are on the
battlefield. Tronjheim has been sealed off. Hrothgar has taken charge of the battalion to our left. Ajihad
leads the one ahead of us.”
“Who commands this one?”
“Jörmundur.” Orik sat with a grunt and placed his war ax on the ground.
Saphira nudged Eragon.Look. His hand tightened on Zar’roc as he saw Murtagh, helmed, carrying a
dwarven shield and his hand-and-a-half sword, approaching with Tornac.
Orik cursed and leapt to his feet, but Murtagh said quickly, “It’s all right; Ajihad released me.”
“Why would he do that?” demanded Orik.
Murtagh smiled wryly. “He said this was an opportunity to prove my good intentions. Apparently, he
doesn’t think I would be able to do much damage even if I did turn on the Varden.”
Eragon nodded in welcome, relaxing his grip. Murtagh was an excellent and merciless fighter—exactly
whom Eragon wanted by his side during battle.
“How do we know you’re not lying?” asked Orik.
“Because I say so,” announced a firm voice. Ajihad strode into their midst, armed for battle with a
breastplate and an ivory-handled sword. He put a strong hand on Eragon’s shoulder and drew him away
where the others could not hear. He cast an eye over Eragon’s armor. “Good, Orik outfitted you.”
“Yes… has anything been seen in the tunnels?”
“Nothing.” Ajihad leaned on his sword. “One of the Twins is staying in Tronjheim. He’s going to watch
the battle from the dragonhold and relay information through his brother to me. I know you can speak
with your mind. I need you to tell the Twins anything,anything, unusual that you see while fighting. Also,
I’ll relay orders to you through them. Do you understand?”
The thought of being linked to the Twins filled Eragon with loathing, but he knew it was necessary. “I
do.”
Ajihad paused. “You’re not a foot soldier or horseman, nor any other type of warrior I’m used to
commanding. Battle may prove differently, but I think you and Saphira will be safer on the ground. In the

Page 283

air, you’ll be a choice target for Urgal archers. Will you fight from Saphira’s back?”
Eragon had never been in combat on horseback, much less on Saphira. “I’m not sure what we’ll do.
When I’m on Saphira, I’m up too high to fight all but a Kull.”
“There will be plenty of Kull, I’m afraid,” said Ajihad. He straightened, pulling his sword out of the
ground. “The only advice I can give you is to avoid unnecessary risks. The Varden cannot afford to lose
you.” With that, he turned and left.
Eragon returned to Orik and Murtagh and hunkered next to Saphira, leaning his shield against his knees.
The four of them waited in silence like the hundreds of warriors around them. Light from Farthen Dûr’s
opening waned as the sun crept below the crater rim.
Eragon turned to scan the encampment and froze, heart jolting. About thirty feet away sat Arya with her
bow in her lap. Though he knew it was unreasonable, he had hoped she might accompany the other
women out of Farthen Dûr. Concerned, he hastened to her. “You will fight?”
“I do what I must,” Arya said calmly.
“But it’s too dangerous!”
Her face darkened. “Do not pamper me, human. Elves train both their men and women to fight. I am not
one of your helpless females to run away whenever there is danger. I was given the task of protecting
Saphira’s egg… which I failed. My breoal is dishonored and would be further shamed if I did not guard
you and Saphira on this field. You forget that I am stronger with magic than any here, including you. If the
Shade comes, who can defeat him but me? And who else has the right?”
Eragon stared at her helplessly, knowing she was right and hating the fact. “Then stay safe.” Out of
desperation, he added in the ancient language, “Wiol pömnuria ilian.” For my happiness.
Arya turned her gaze away uneasily, the fringe of her hair obscuring her face. She ran a hand along her
polished bow, then murmured, “It is my wyrd to be here. The debt must be paid.”
He abruptly retreated to Saphira. Murtagh looked at him curiously. “What did she say?”
“Nothing.”
Wrapped in their own thoughts, the defenders sank into a brooding silence as the hours crawled by.
Farthen Dûr’s crater again grew black, except for the sanguine lantern glow and the fires heating the
pitch. Eragon alternated between myopically examining the links of his mail and spying on Arya. Orik
repeatedly ran a whetstone over the blade of his ax, periodically eyeing the edge between strokes; the
rasp of metal on stone was irritating. Murtagh just stared into the distance.
Occasionally, messengers ran through the encampment, causing the warriors to surge to their feet. But it
always proved to be a false alarm. The men and dwarves became strained; angry voices were often
heard. The worst part about Farthen Dûr was the lack of wind—the air was dead, motionless. Even
when it grew warm and stifling and filled with smoke, there was no reprieve.
As the night dragged on, the battlefield stilled, silent as death. Muscles stiffened from the waiting. Eragon
stared blankly into the darkness with heavy eyelids. He shook himself to alertness and tried to focus
through his stupor.

Page 284

Finally Orik said, “It’s late. We should sleep. If anything happens, the others will wake us.” Murtagh
grumbled, but Eragon was too tired to complain. He curled up against Saphira, using his shield as a
pillow. As his eyes closed, he saw that Arya was still awake, watching over them.
His dreams were confused and disturbing, full of horned beasts and unseen menaces. Over and over he
heard a deep voice ask, “Are you ready?” But he never had an answer. Plagued by such visions, his
sleep was shallow and uneasy until something touched his arm. He woke with a start.
BATTLEUNDERFARTHENDÛR
“It has begun,” Arya said with a sorrowful expression. The troops in the encampment stood alertly with
their weapons drawn. Orik swung his ax to make sure he had enough room. Arya nocked an arrow and
held it ready to shoot.
“A scout ran out of a tunnel a few minutes ago,” said Murtagh to Eragon. “The Urgals are coming.”
Together they watched the dark mouth of the tunnel through the ranks of men and sharpened stakes. A
minute dragged by, then another… and another. Without taking his eyes from the tunnel, Eragon hoisted
himself into Saphira’s saddle, Zar’roc in his hand, a comfortable weight. Murtagh mounted Tornac beside
him. Then a man cried, “I hear them!”
The warriors stiffened; grips tightened on weapons. No one moved… no one breathed. Somewhere a
horse nickered.
Harsh Urgal shouts shattered the air as dark shapes boiled upward in the tunnel’s opening. At a
command, the cauldrons of pitch were tilted on their sides, pouring the scalding liquid into the tunnel’s
hungry throat. The monsters howled in pain, arms flailing. A torch was thrown onto the bubbling pitch,
and an orange pillar of greasy flames roared up in the opening, engulfing the Urgals in an inferno.
Sickened, Eragon looked across Farthen Dûr at the other two battalions and saw similar fires by each.
He sheathed Zar’roc and strung his bow.
More Urgals soon tamped the pitch down and clambered out of the tunnels over their burned brethren.
They clumped together, presenting a solid wall to the men and dwarves. Behind the palisade Orik had
helped build, the first row of archers pulled on their bows and fired. Eragon and Arya added their arrows
to the deadly swarm and watched the shafts eat through the Urgals’ ranks.
The Urgal line wavered, threatening to break, but they covered themselves with their shields and
weathered the attack. Again the archers fired, but the Urgals continued to stream onto the surface at a
ferocious rate.
Eragon was dismayed by their numbers. They were supposed to kill every single one? It seemed a
madman’s task. His only encouragement was that he saw none of Galbatorix’s troops with the Urgals.
Not yet, at least.
The opposing army formed a solid mass of bodies that seemed to stretch endlessly. Tattered and sullen
standards were raised in the monsters’ midst. Baleful notes echoed through Farthen Dûr as war horns
sounded. The entire group of Urgals charged with savage war cries.
They dashed against the rows of stakes, covering them with slick blood and limp corpses as the ranks at
the vanguard were crushed against the posts. A cloud of black arrows flew over the barrier at the

Page 285

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

crouched defenders. Eragon ducked behind his shield, and Saphira covered her head. Arrows rattled
harmlessly against her armor.
Momentarily foiled by the pickets, the Urgal horde milled with confusion. The Varden bunched together,
waiting for the next attack. After a pause, the war cries were raised again as the Urgals surged forward.
The assault was bitter. Its momentum carried the Urgals through the stakes, where a line of pikemen
jabbed frantically at their ranks, trying to repel them. The pikemen held briefly, but the ominous tide of
Urgals could not be halted, and they were overwhelmed.
The first lines of defense breached, the main bodies of the two forces collided for the first time. A
deafening roar burst from the men and dwarves as they rushed into the conflict. Saphira bellowed and
leapt toward the fight, diving into a whirlwind of noise and blurred action.
With her jaws and talons, Saphira tore through an Urgal. Her teeth were as lethal as any sword, her tail
a giant mace. From her back, Eragon parried a hammer blow from an Urgal chief, protecting her
vulnerable wings. Zar’roc’s crimson blade seemed to gleam with delight as blood spurted along its length.
From the corner of his eye, Eragon saw Orik hewing Urgal necks with mighty blows of his ax. Beside
the dwarf was Murtagh on Tornac, his face disfigured by a vicious snarl as he swung his sword angrily,
cutting through every defense. Then Saphira spun around, and Eragon saw Arya leap past the lifeless
body of an opponent.
An Urgal bowled over a wounded dwarf and hacked at Saphira’s front right leg. His sword skated off
her armor with a burst of sparks. Eragon smote him on the head, but Zar’roc stuck in the monster’s
horns and was yanked from his grasp. With a curse he dived off Saphira and tackled the Urgal, smashing
his face with the shield. He jerked Zar’roc out of the horns, then dodged as another Urgal charged him.
Saphira, I need you!he shouted, but the battle’s tide had separated them. Suddenly a Kull jumped at
him, club raised for a blow. Unable to lift his shield in time, Eragon uttered, “Jierda!” The Kull’s head
snapped back with a sharp report as his neck broke. Four more Urgals succumbed to Zar’roc’s thirsty
bite, then Murtagh rode up beside Eragon, driving the press of Urgals backward.
“Come on!” he shouted, and reached down from Tornac, pulling Eragon onto the horse. They rushed
toward Saphira, who was embroiled in a mass of enemies. Twelve spear-wielding Urgals encircled her,
needling her with their lances. They had already managed to prick both of her wings. Her blood
splattered the ground. Every time she rushed at one of the Urgals, they bunched together and jabbed at
her eyes, forcing her to retreat. She tried to sweep the spears away with her talons, but the Urgals
jumped back and evaded her.
The sight of Saphira’s blood enraged Eragon. He swung off Tornac with a wild cry and stabbed the
nearest Urgal through the chest, withholding nothing in his frenzied attempt to help Saphira. His attack
provided the distraction she needed to break free. With a kick, she sent an Urgal flying, then barreled to
him. Eragon grabbed one of her neck spikes and pulled himself back into her saddle. Murtagh raised his
hand, then charged into another knot of Urgals.
By unspoken consent, Saphira took flight and rose above the struggling armies, seeking a respite from
the madness. Eragon’s breath trembled. His muscles were clenched, ready to ward off the next attack.
Every fiber of his being thrilled with energy, making him feel more alive than ever before.
Saphira circled long enough for them to recover their strength, then descended toward the Urgals,
skimming the ground to avoid detection. She approached the monsters from behind, where their archers

Page 286

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

were gathered.
Before the Urgals realized what was happening, Eragon lopped off the heads of two archers, and
Saphira disemboweled three others. She took off again as alarms sounded, quickly soaring out of bow
range.
They repeated the tactic on a different flank of the army. Saphira’s stealth and speed, combined with the
dim lighting, made it nearly impossible for the Urgals to predict where she would strike next. Eragon used
his bow whenever Saphira was in the air, but he quickly ran out of arrows. Soon the only thing left in his
quiver was magic, which he wanted to keep in reserve until it was desperately needed.
Saphira’s flights over the combatants gave Eragon a unique understanding of how the battle was
progressing. There were three separate fights raging in Farthen Dûr, one by each open tunnel. The Urgals
were disadvantaged by the dispersal of their forces and their inability to get all of their army out of the
tunnels at once. Even so, the Varden and dwarves could not keep the monsters from advancing and were
slowly being driven back toward Tronjheim. The defenders seemed insignificant against the mass of
Urgals, whose numbers continued to increase as they poured out of the tunnels.
The Urgals had organized themselves around several standards, each representing a clan, but it was
unclear who commanded them overall. The clans paid no attention to each other, as if they were
receiving orders from elsewhere. Eragon wished he knew who was in charge so he and Saphira could kill
him.
Remembering Ajihad’s orders, he began relaying information to the Twins. They were interested by
what he had to say about the Urgals’ apparent lack of a leader and questioned him closely. The exchange
was smooth, if brief. The Twins told him,You’re ordered to assist Hrothgar; the fight goes badly for him.
Understood,Eragon responded.
Saphira swiftly flew to the besieged dwarves, swooping low over Hrothgar. Arrayed in golden armor,
the dwarf king stood at the fore of a small knot of his kin, wielding Volund, the hammer of his ancestors.
His white beard caught the lantern light as he looked up at Saphira. Admiration glinted in his eyes.
Saphira landed beside the dwarves and faced the oncoming Urgals. Even the bravest Kull quailed before
her ferocity, allowing the dwarves to surge forward. Eragon tried to keep Saphira safe. Her left flank was
protected by the dwarves, but to her front and right raged a sea of enemies. He showed no mercy on
those and took every advantage he could, using magic whenever Zar’roc could not serve him. A spear
bounced off his shield, denting it and leaving him with a bruised shoulder. Shaking off the pain, he cleaved
open an Urgal’s skull, mixing brains with metal and bone.
He was in awe of Hrothgar—who, though he was ancient by both the standards of men and dwarves,
was still undiminished on the battlefield. No Urgal, Kull or not, could stand before the dwarf king and his
guards and live. Every time Volund struck, it sounded the gong of death for another enemy. After a spear
downed one of his warriors, Hrothgar grabbed the spear himself and, with astounding strength, hurled it
completely through its owner twenty yards away. Such heroism emboldened Eragon to ever greater
risks, seeking to hold his own with the mighty king.
Eragon lunged at a giant Kull nearly out of reach and almost fell from Saphira’s saddle. Before he could
recover, the Kull darted past Saphira’s defenses and swung his sword. The brunt of the blow caught
Eragon on the side of his helm, throwing him backward and making his vision flicker and his ears ring
thunderously.

Page 287

Stunned, he tried to pull himself upright, but the Kull had already prepared for another blow. As the
Kull’s arm descended, a slim steel blade suddenly sprouted from his chest. Howling, the monster toppled
to the side. In his place stood Angela.
The witch wore a long red cape over outlandish flanged armor enameled black and green. She bore a
strange two-handed weapon—a long wooden shaft with a sword blade attached to each end. Angela
winked at Eragon mischievously, then dashed away, spinning her staff-sword like a dervish. Close behind
her was Solembum in the form of a young shaggy-haired boy. He held a small black dagger, sharp teeth
bared in a feral snarl.
Still dazed from his battering, Eragon managed to straighten himself in the saddle. Saphira jumped into
the air and wheeled high above, letting him recuperate. He scanned Farthen Dûr’s plains and saw, to his
dismay, that all three battles were going badly. Neither Ajihad, Jörmundur, nor Hrothgar could stop the
Urgals. There were simply too many.
Eragon wondered how many Urgals he could kill at once with magic. He knew his limits fairly well. If he
were to kill enough to make a difference… it would probably be suicide. That might be what it took to
win.
The fighting continued for one endless hour after another. The Varden and dwarves were exhausted, but
the Urgals remained fresh with reinforcements.
It was a nightmare for Eragon. Though he and Saphira fought their hardest, there was always another
Urgal to take the place of the one just killed. His whole body hurt—especially his head. Every time he
used magic he lost a little more energy. Saphira was in better condition, though her wings were punctured
with small wounds.
As he parried a blow, the Twins contacted him urgently.There are loud noises under Tronjheim. It
sounds like Urgals are trying to dig into the city! We need you and Arya to collapse any tunnels they’re
excavating.
Eragon dispatched his opponent with a sword thrust.We’ll be right there. He looked for Arya and saw
her engaged with a knot of struggling Urgals. Saphira quickly forged a path to the elf, leaving a pile of
crumpled bodies in her wake. Eragon extended his hand and said, “Get on!”
Arya jumped onto Saphira’s back without hesitation. She wrapped her right arm around Eragon’s waist,
wielding her bloodstained sword with the other. As Saphira crouched to take off, an Urgal ran at her,
howling, then lifted an ax and smashed her in the chest.
Saphira roared with pain and lurched forward, feet leaving the ground. Her wings snapped open,
straining to keep them from crashing as she veered wildly to one side, right wingtip scraping the ground.
Below them, the Urgal pulled back his arm to throw the ax. But Arya raised her palm, shouting, and an
emerald ball of energy shot from her hand, killing the Urgal. With a colossal heave of her shoulders,
Saphira righted herself, barely making it over the heads of the warriors. She pulled away from the
battlefield with powerful wing strokes and rasping breath.
Are you all right?asked Eragon, concerned. He could not see where she had been struck.
I’ll live,she said grimly,but the front of my armor has been crushed together. It hurts my chest, and I’m
having trouble moving.

Page 288

Can you get us to the dragonhold?
…We’ll see.
Eragon explained Saphira’s condition to Arya. “I’ll stay and help Saphira when we land,” she offered.
“Once she is free of the armor, I will join you.”
“Thank you,” he said. The flight was laborious for Saphira; she glided whenever she could. When they
reached the dragonhold, she dropped heavily to Isidar Mithrim, where the Twins were supposed to be
watching the battle, but it was empty. Eragon jumped to the floor and winced as he saw the damage the
Urgal had done. Four of the metal plates on Saphira’s chest had been hammered together, restricting her
ability to bend and breathe. “Stay well,” he said, putting a hand on her side, then ran out the archway.
He stopped and swore. He was at the top of Vol Turin, The Endless Staircase. Because of his worry for
Saphira, he had not considered how he would get to Tronjheim’s base—where the Urgals were breaking
in. There was no time to climb down. He looked at the narrow trough to the right of the stairs, then
grabbed one of the leather pads and threw himself down on it.
The stone slide was smooth as lacquered wood. With the leather underneath him, he accelerated almost
instantly to a frightening speed, the walls blurring and the curve of the slide pressing him high against the
wall. Eragon lay completely flat so he would go faster. The air rushed past his helm, making it vibrate like
a weather vane in a gale. The trough was too confined for him, and he was perilously close to flying out,
but as long as he kept his arms and legs still, he was safe.
It was a swift descent, but it still took him nearly ten minutes to reach the bottom. The slide leveled out at
the end and sent him skidding halfway across the huge carnelian floor.
When he finally came to a stop, he was too dizzy to walk. His first attempt to stand made him nauseated,
so he curled up, head in his hands, and waited for things to stop spinning. When he felt better, he stood
and warily looked around.
The great chamber was completely deserted, the silence unsettling. Rosy light filtered down from Isidar
Mithrim. He faltered—Where was he supposed to go?—and cast out his mind for the Twins. Nothing.
He froze as loud knocking echoed through Tronjheim.
An explosion split the air. A long slab of the chamber floor buckled and blew thirty feet up. Needles of
rocks flew outward as it crashed down. Eragon stumbled back, stunned, groping for Zar’roc. The
twisted shapes of Urgals clambered out of the hole in the floor.
Eragon hesitated. Should he flee? Or should he stay and try to close the tunnel? Even if he managed to
seal it before the Urgals attacked him, what if Tronjheim was already breached elsewhere? He could not
find all the places in time to prevent the city-mountain from being captured.But if I run to one of
Tronjheim’s gates and blast it open, the Varden could retake Tronjheim without having to siege it. Before
he could decide, a tall man garbed entirely in black armor emerged from the tunnel and looked directly at
him.
It was Durza.
The Shade carried his pale blade marked with the scratch from Ajihad. A black roundshield with a
crimson ensign rested on his arm. His dark helmet was richly decorated, like a general’s, and a long

Page 289

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

snakeskin cloak billowed around him. Madness burned in his maroon eyes, the madness of one who
enjoys power and finds himself in the position to use it.
Eragon knew he was neither fast enough nor strong enough to escape the fiend before him. He
immediately warned Saphira, though he knew it was impossible for her to rescue him. He dropped into a
crouch and quickly reviewed what Brom had told him about fighting another magic user. It was not
encouraging. And Ajihad had said that Shades could only be destroyed by a thrust through the heart.
Durza gazed at him contemptuously and said, “Kaz jtierl trazhid! Otrag bagh.” The Urgals eyed Eragon
suspiciously and formed a circle around the perimeter of the room. Durza slowly approached Eragon
with a triumphant expression. “So, my young Rider, we meet again. You were foolish to escape from me
in Gil’ead. It will only make things worse for you in the end.”
“You’ll never capture me alive,” growled Eragon.
“Is that so?” asked the Shade, raising an eyebrow. The light from the star sapphire gave his skin a
ghastly tint. “I don’t see your ‘friend’ Murtagh around to help you. You can’t stop me now. No one
can!”
Fear touched Eragon.How does he know about Murtagh? Putting all the derision he could into his voice,
he jeered, “How did you like being shot?”
Durza’s face tightened momentarily. “I will be repaid in blood for that. Now tell me where your dragon
is hiding.”
“Never.”
The Shade’s countenance darkened. “Then I will force it from you!” His sword whistled through the air.
The moment Eragon caught the blade on his shield, a mental probe spiked deep into his thoughts.
Fighting to protect his consciousness, he shoved Durza back and attacked with his own mind.
Eragon battered with all his strength against the iron-hard defenses surrounding Durza’s mind, but to no
avail. He swung Zar’roc, trying to catch Durza off guard. The Shade knocked the blow aside effortlessly,
then stabbed in return with lightning speed.
The point of the sword caught Eragon in the ribs, piercing his mail and driving out his breath. The mail
slipped, though, and the blade missed his side by the width of a wire. The distraction was all Durza
needed to break into Eragon’s mind and begin taking control.
“No!” cried Eragon, throwing himself at the Shade. His face contorted as he grappled with Durza,
yanking on his sword arm. Durza tried to cut Eragon’s hand, but it was protected by the mail-backed
glove, which sent the blade glancing downward. As Eragon kicked his leg, Durza snarled and swept his
black shield around, knocking him to the floor. Eragon tasted blood in his mouth; his neck throbbed.
Ignoring his injuries, he rolled over and hurled his shield at Durza. Despite the Shade’s superior speed,
the heavy shield clipped him on the hip. As Durza stumbled, Eragon caught him on the upper arm with
Zar’roc. A line of blood traced down the Shade’s arm.
Eragon thrust at the Shade with his mind and drove through Durza’s weakened defenses. A flood of
images suddenly engulfed him, rushing through his consciousness—

Page 290

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Durza as a young boy living as a nomad with his parents on the empty plains. The tribe abandoned them
and called his father “oathbreaker.” Only it was not Durza then, but Carsaib—the name his mother
crooned while combing his hair…

The Shade reeled wildly, face twisted in pain. Eragon tried to control the torrent of memories, but the
force of them was overwhelming.

Standing on a hill over the graves of his parents, weeping that the men had not killed him as well. Then
turning and stumbling blindly away, into the desert…

Durza faced Eragon. Terrible hatred flowed from his maroon eyes. Eragon was on one knee—almost
standing—struggling to seal his mind.

How the old man looked when he first saw Carsaib lying near death on a sand dune. The days it had
taken Carsaib to recover and the fear he felt upon discovering that his rescuer was a sorcerer. How he
had pleaded to be taught the control of spirits. How Haeg had finally agreed. Called him “Desert Rat.”…

Eragon was standing now. Durza charged… sword raised… shield ignored in his fury.

The days spent training under the scorching sun, always alert for the lizards they caught for food. How
his power slowly grew, giving him pride and confidence. The weeks spent nursing his sick master after a
failed spell. His joy when Haeg recovered…

There was not enough time to react… not enough time…

The bandits who attacked during the night, killing Haeg. The rage Carsaib had felt and the spirits he had
summoned for vengeance. But the spirits were stronger than he expected. They turned on him,
possessing mind and body. He had screamed. He was—I AM DURZA!

The sword smote heavily across Eragon’s back, cutting through both mail and skin. He screamed as
pain blasted through him, forcing him to his knees. Agony bowed his body in half and obliterated all
thought. He swayed, barely conscious, hot blood running down the small of his back. Durza said

Page 291

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

something he could not hear.
In anguish, Eragon raised his eyes to the heavens, tears streaming down his cheeks. Everything had
failed. The Varden and dwarves were destroyed. He was defeated. Saphira would give herself up for his
sake—she had done it before—and Arya would be recaptured or killed. Why had it ended like this?
What justice could this be? All was for nothing.
As he looked at Isidar Mithrim far above his tortured frame, a flash of light erupted in his eyes, blinding
him. A second later, the chamber rang with a deafening report. Then his eyes cleared, and he gaped with
disbelief.
The star sapphire had shattered. An expanding torus of huge dagger-like pieces plummeted toward the
distant floor—the shimmering shards near the walls. In the center of the chamber, hurtling downward
headfirst, was Saphira. Her jaws were open and from between them erupted a great tongue of flame,
bright yellow and tinged with blue. On her back was Arya: hair billowing wildly, arm uplifted, palm
glowing with a nimbus of green magic.
Time seemed to slow as Eragon saw Durza tilt his head toward the ceiling. First shock, then anger
contorted the Shade’s face. Sneering defiantly, he raised his hand and pointed at Saphira, a word forming
on his lips.
A hidden reserve of strength suddenly welled up inside Eragon, dredged from the deepest part of his
being. His fingers curled around the hilt of his sword. He plunged through the barrier in his mind and took
hold of the magic. All his pain and rage focused on one word:
“Brisingr!”
Zar’roc blazed with bloody light, heatless flames running along it…
He lunged forward…
And stabbed Durza in the heart.
Durza looked down with shock at the blade protruding from his breast. His mouth was open, but instead
of words, an unearthly howl burst from him. His sword dropped from nerveless fingers. He grasped
Zar’roc as if to pull it out, but it was lodged firmly in him.
Then Durza’s skin turned transparent. Under it was neither flesh nor bone, but swirling patterns of
darkness. He shrieked even louder as the darkness pulsated, splitting his skin. With one last cry, Durza
was rent from head to toe, releasing the darkness, which separated into three entities who flew through
Tronjheim’s walls and out of Farthen Dûr. The Shade was gone.
Bereft of strength, Eragon fell back with arms outstretched. Above him, Saphira and Arya had nearly
reached the floor—it looked as if they were going to smash into it with the deadly remains of Isidar
Mithrim. As his sight faded, Saphira, Arya, the myriad fragments—all seemed to stop falling and hang
motionless in the air.
THEMOURNINGSAGE
Snatches of the Shade’s memories continued to flash through Eragon. A whirlwind of dark events and
emotions overwhelmed him, making it impossible to think. Submerged in the maelstrom, he knew neither

Page 292

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

who nor where he was. He was too weak to cleanse himself of the alien presence that clouded his mind.
Violent, cruel images from the Shade’s past exploded behind his eyes until his spirit cried out in anguish at
the bloody sights.
A pile of bodies rose before him… innocents slaughtered by the Shade’s orders. He saw still more
corpses—whole villages of them—taken from life by the sorcerer’s hand or word. There was no escape
from the carnage that surrounded him. He wavered like a candle flame, unable to withstand the tide of
evil. He prayed for someone to lift him out of the nightmare, but there was no one to guide him. If only he
could remember what he was supposed to be: boy or man, villain or hero, Shade or Rider; all was
jumbled together in a meaningless frenzy. He was lost, completely and utterly, in the roiling mass.
Suddenly a cluster of his own memories burst through the dismal cloud left by the Shade’s malevolent
mind. All the events since he had found Saphira’s egg came to him in the cold light of revelation. His
accomplishments and failures were displayed equally. He had lost much that was dear to him, yet fate
had given him rare and great gifts; for the first time, he was proud of simply who he was. As if in
response to his brief self-confidence, the Shade’s smothering blackness assaulted him anew. His identity
trailed into the void as uncertainty and fear consumed his perceptions. Who was he to think he could
challenge the powers of Alagaësia and live?
He fought against the Shade’s sinister thoughts, weakly at first, then more strongly. He whispered words
of the ancient language and found they gave him enough strength to withstand the shadow blurring his
mind. Though his defenses faltered dangerously, he slowly began to draw his shattered consciousness
into a small bright shell around his core. Outside his mind he was aware of a pain so great it threatened to
blot out his very life, but something—or someone—seemed to keep it at bay.
He was still too weak to clear his mind completely, but he was lucid enough to examine his experiences
since Carvahall. Where would he go now… and who would show him the way? Without Brom, there
was no one to guide or teach him.
Come to me.
He recoiled at the touch of another consciousness—one so vast and powerful it was like a mountain
looming over him. This was who was blocking the pain, he realized. Like Arya’s mind, music ran through
this one: deep amber-gold chords that throbbed with magisterial melancholy.
Finally, he dared ask,Who… who are you?
One who would help.With a flicker of an unspoken thought, the Shade’s influence was brushed aside
like an unwanted cobweb. Freed from the oppressive weight, Eragon let his mind expand until he
touched a barrier beyond which he could not pass. I have protected you as best I can, but you are so far
away I can do no more than shield your sanity from the pain.
Again:Who are you to do this?
There was a low rumble.I am Osthato Chetowä, the Mourning Sage. And Togira Ikonoka, the Cripple
Who Is Whole. Come to me, Eragon, for I have answers to all you ask. You will not be safe until you
find me.
But how can I find you if I don’t know where you are?he asked, despairing.
Trust Arya and go with her to Ellesméra—I will be there. I have waited many seasons, so do not delay

or it may soon be too late… You are greater than you know, Eragon. Think of what you have done and
rejoice, for you have rid the land of a great evil. You have wrought a deed no one else could. Many are
in your debt.
The stranger was right; what he had accomplished was worthy of honor, of recognition. No matter what
his trials might be in the future, he was no longer just a pawn in the game of power. He had transcended
that and was something else, something more. He had become what Ajihad wanted: an authority
independent of any king or leader.
He sensed approval as he reached that conclusion.You are learning,said the Mourning Sage, drawing
nearer. A vision passed from him to Eragon: a burst of color blossomed in his mind, resolving into a
stooped figure dressed in white, standing on a sun-drenched stone cliff. It is time for you to rest, Eragon.
When you wake, do not speak of me to anyone,said the figure kindly, face obscured by a silver nimbus.
Remember, you must go to the elves. Now, sleep…He raised a hand, as if in benediction, and peace
crept through Eragon.
His last thought was that Brom would have been proud of him.

“Wake,” commanded the voice. “Awake, Eragon, for you have slept far too long.” He stirred
unwillingly, loath to listen. The warmth that surrounded him was too comfortable to leave. The voice
sounded again. “Rise, Argetlam! You are needed!”
He reluctantly forced his eyes open and found himself on a long bed, swathed in soft blankets. Angela
sat in a chair beside him, staring at his face intently. “How do you feel?” she asked.
Disoriented and confused, he let his eyes roam over the small room. “I… I don’t know,” he said, his
mouth dry and sore.
“Then don’t move. You should conserve your strength,” said Angela, running a hand through her curly
hair. Eragon saw that she still wore her flanged armor. Why was that? A fit of coughing made him dizzy,
lightheaded, and ache all over. His feverish limbs felt heavy. Angela lifted a gilt horn from the floor and
held it to his lips. “Here, drink.”
Cool mead ran down his throat, refreshing him. Warmth bloomed in his stomach and rose to his cheeks.
He coughed again, which worsened his throbbing head. How did I get here? There was a battle… we
were losing… then Durza and… “Saphira!” he exclaimed, sitting upright. He sagged back as his head
swam and clenched his eyes, feeling sick. “What about Saphira? Is she all right? The Urgals were
winning… she was falling. And Arya!”
“They lived,” assured Angela, “and have been waiting for you to wake. Do you wish to see them?” He
nodded feebly. Angela got up and threw open the door. Arya and Murtagh filed inside. Saphira snaked
her head into the room after them, her body too big to fit through the doorway. Her chest vibrated as she
hummed deeply, eyes sparkling.
Smiling, Eragon touched her thoughts with relief and gratitude.It is good to see you well, little one, she
said tenderly.
And you too, but how—?

Page 294

The others want to explain it, so I will let them.
You breathed fire! I saw you!
Yes,she said with pride.
He smiled weakly, still confused, then looked at Arya and Murtagh. Both of them were bandaged: Arya
on her arm, Murtagh around his head. Murtagh grinned widely. “About time you were up. We’ve been
sitting in the hall for hours.”
“What… what happened?” asked Eragon.
Arya looked sad. But Murtagh crowed, “We won! It was incredible! When the Shade’s spirits—if
that’s what they were—flew across Farthen Dûr, the Urgals ceased fighting to watch them go. It was as
though they were released from a spell then, because their clans suddenly turned and attacked each
other. Their entire army disintegrated within minutes. We routed them after that!”
“They’re all dead?” asked Eragon.
Murtagh shook his head. “No, many of them escaped into the tunnels. The Varden and dwarves are
busy ferreting them out right now, but it’s going to take a while. I was helping until an Urgal banged me
on the head and I was sent back here.”
“They aren’t going to lock you up again?”
His face grew sober. “No one really cares about that right now. A lot of Varden and dwarves were
killed; the survivors are busy trying to recover from the battle. But at least you have cause to be happy.
You’re a hero! Everyone’s talking about how you killed Durza. If it hadn’t been for you, we would have
lost.”
Eragon was troubled by his words but pushed them away for later consideration. “Where were the
Twins? They weren’t where they were supposed to be—I couldn’t contact them. I needed their help.”
Murtagh shrugged. “I was told they bravely fought off a group of Urgals that broke into Tronjheim
somewhere else. They were probably too busy to talk with you.”
That seemed wrong for some reason, but Eragon could not decide why. He turned to Arya. Her large
bright eyes had been fixed upon him the entire time. “How come you didn’t crash? You and Saphira
were… ” His voice trailed off.
She said slowly, “When you warned Saphira of Durza, I was still trying to remove her damaged armor.
By the time it was off, it was too late to slide down Vol Turin—you would have been captured before I
reached the bottom. Besides, Durza would have killed you before letting me rescue you.” Regret entered
her voice, “So I did the one thing I could to distract him: I broke the star sapphire.”
And I carried her down,added Saphira.
Eragon struggled to understand as another bout of lightheadedness made him close his eyes. “But why
didn’t any of the pieces hit you or me?”
“I didn’t allow them to. When we were almost to the floor, I held them motionless in the air, then slowly

Page 295

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

lowered them to the floor—else they would have shattered into a thousand pieces and killed you,” stated
Arya simply. Her words betrayed the power within her.
Angela added sourly, “Yes, and it almost killed you as well. It’s taken all of my skill to keep the two of
you alive.”
A twinge of unease shot through Eragon, matching the intensity of his throbbing head.My back… But he
felt no bandages there. “How long have I been here?” he asked with trepidation.
“Only a day and a half,” answered Angela. “You’re lucky I was around, otherwise it would’ve taken
you weeks to heal—if you had even lived.” Alarmed, Eragon pushed the blankets off his torso and
twisted around to feel his back. Angela caught his wrist with her small hand, worry reflected in her eyes.
“Eragon… you have to understand, my power is not like yours or Arya’s. It depends on the use of herbs
and potions. There are limits to what I can do, especially with such a large—”
He yanked his hand out of her grip and reached back, fingers groping. The skin on his back was smooth
and warm, flawless. Hard muscles flexed under his fingertips as he moved. He slid his hand toward the
base of his neck and unexpectedly felt a hard bump about a half-inch wide. He followed it down his back
with growing horror. Durza’s blow had left him with a huge, ropy scar, stretching from his right shoulder
to the opposite hip.
Pity showed on Arya’s face as she murmured, “You have paid a terrible price for your deed, Eragon
Shadeslayer.”
Murtagh laughed harshly. “Yes. Now you’re just like me.”
Dismay filled Eragon, and he closed his eyes. He was disfigured. Then he remembered something from
when he was unconscious… a figure in white who had helped him. A cripple who was whole—Togira
Ikonoka. He had said,Think of what you have done and rejoice, for you have rid the land of a great evil.
You have wrought a deed no one else could. Many are in your debt…
Come to me Eragon, for I have answers to all you ask.
A measure of peace and satisfaction consoled Eragon.
I will come.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
IcreatedEragon, but its success is the result of the enthusiastic efforts of friends, family, fans, librarians,
teachers, students, school administrators, distributors, booksellers, and many more. I wish I could
mention by name all the people who have helped, but the list is very, very long. You know who you are,
and I thank you!

Eragonwas first published in early 2002 by my parents’ publishing company, Paolini International LLC.
They had already released three books, so it was only natural to do the same withEragon . We knew
Eragon would appeal to a wide range of readers; our challenge was to spread the word about it.
During 2002 and the beginning of 2003, I traveled throughout the United States doing over 130 book
signings and presentations in schools, bookstores, and libraries. My mother and I arranged all the events.
At first I had only one or two appearances per month, but as we became more efficient at scheduling, our
homemade book tour expanded to the point where I was on the road almost continuously.
I met thousands of wonderful people, many of whom became loyal fans and friends. One of those fans is
Michelle Frey, now my editor at Knopf Books for Young Readers, who approached me with an offer to
acquireEragon . Needless to say, I was delighted that Knopf was interested in my book.
Thus, there are two groups of people who deserve thanks. The first assisted with the production of the
Paolini International LLC edition ofEragon, while the second is responsible for the Knopf edition.
Here are the brave souls who helped bring Eragoninto existence:
The original gang: my mother for her thoughtful red pen and wonderful help with commas, colons,
semicolons, and other assorted beasties; my father for his smashing editing job, all the time he spent
hammering my vague, wayward thoughts into line, formatting the book and designing the cover, and
listening to so many presentations; Grandma Shirley for helping me create a satisfactory beginning and
ending; my sister for her plot advice, her good humor at being portrayed as an herbalist in Eragon,and her
long hours Photoshop’ing Saphira’s eye on the cover; Kathy Tyers for giving me the means to do a
brutal—and much-needed—rewrite of the first three chapters; John Taliaferro for his advice and
wonderful review; a fan named Tornado—Eugene Walker—who caught a number of copyediting errors;
and Donna Overall for her love of the story, editing and formatting advice, and keen eye for all things
concerning ellipses, em dashes, widows, orphans, kerning, and run-on sentences. If there’s a real-life
Dragon Rider, she’s one—selflessly coming to the rescue of writers lost in the Swamp of Commas. And
I thank my family for supporting me wholeheartedly… and for reading this saga more times than any sane
person should have to.
The new gang: Michelle Frey, who not only loved the story enough to take a chance on an epic fantasy
written by a teenager but also managed to streamlineEragon ’s pacing through her insightful editing; my
agent, Simon Lipskar, who helped find the best home forEragon; Chip Gibson and Beverly Horowitz for
the wonderful offer; Lawrence Levy for his good humor and legal advice; Judith Haut, publicity whiz of
the first degree; Daisy Kline for the awe-inspiring marketing campaign; Isabel Warren-Lynch, who
designed the lovely book jacket, interior, and map; John Jude Palencar, who painted the jacket art (I
actually named Palancar Valley for him long before he ever worked onEragon ); Artie Bennett, the doyen
of copyediting and the only man alive who understood the difference betweento scry it andto scry on it;
and the entire team at Knopf who have made this adventure possible.
Lastly, a special thanks to my characters, who bravely face the dangers I force them to confront, and
without whom I wouldn’t have a story.
May your swords stay sharp!

PARTINGWORDS:ANINTERVIEW WITH THEAUTHOR
(From the Factsource.com website)

1. Hi Christopher, thanks for your time! Please take a moment to introduce yourself.
Hello! I’m Christopher James Paolini, eighteen-year-old author and illustrator of Eragon, an epic
472-page fantasy. And welcome to my interview. I enjoyed writing it, and I certainly hope you enjoy
reading it.

2. Tell us about your publishing history.
In November 1998 I graduated from high school at fifteen. I was homeschooled—and having nothing
absolutely required of me, I sat down and began writing. For three-and-a-half years I worked on
Eragon. It took a year for the first draft, a year for the second draft, and another year for editing. Finally,
at the beginning of 2002, I held the finished book in my hands, which was simply incredible. Eragon is my
first published work.

3. How did you prepare yourself to become a novelist?
I read everything about writing I could get my hands on—specifically The Writer’s Handbook, which is
published each year and has wonderful essays on the craft by various authors, and Story, by Robert
McKee. Story is actually what taught me how to plot a novel. It’s written for screenwriters, but the
principles are universal. Another valuable book was Orson Scott Card’s Character and Viewpoint. It
answers all those tricky questions like, “Am I really in a limited third-person point of view here, or is it an
omniscient point of view?”
My technical knowledge—that is, the ability to express myself clearly in words—was mainly a result of
the year of editing on my book. Great editing, even good editing, can teach you more about writing than
anything else. That is, if you have the stomach to see your precious work, which you’ve been up till 3:00
a.m. polishing, covered in a sea of red ink. The trick, though, is finding an editor who knows the craft
intimately, is acquainted with your genre, and has fallen in love with your work. Sometimes a family
member can do it, other times you may have to hire a professional. In my case, I was lucky enough to
have parents who were both interested—and qualified—in editing Eragon. They put a huge amount of
work into the manuscript. It’s all we worked on for most of 2001.
A personal comment here: If a reader has fallen in love with a work, often they won’t edit well. One of
my best editors actually disliked the manuscript! Also most family members of writers will do poor
editing. Again, my experience was an exception.
The true mark of an accomplished writer is that he or she isn’t afraid to rewrite something if it’s bad, no
matter how many times it takes to reach (adequate) perfection.

4. How did you find your publisher?
Ah yes, the eternal question for aspiring writers: How did you get published? Well, in this case I had a
slight advantage. Both my parents are published authors—I’m actually a third-generation author—and
they own a publishing company based out of Paradise Valley, Montana.

I still have the option of signing with a large publisher, but for now my family and I retain complete
control, and plan maintaining complete control over Eragon.

5. Tell us about Eragon.
Eragon is the saga of a young man, Eragon, who becomes intricately linked with the brilliant-blue dragon
Saphira. Together they set off on the series of adventures through the fantastical land of Alagaësia. On
the way they encounter battles, villains, duels, romance… and all the good things a story needs.
Eragon is the first in a trilogy titled Inheritance, and I’m currently in the middle of book II, Eldest. Having
recently finished the script adaptation for Eragon, I’m now looking for someone willing to produce it as a
movie.
I wrote Eragon in an attempt to combine and distill all the elements of heroic fantasy that I loved as a
child, not so long ago. It frustrated me because I read so many books where everything was perfect,
except for that one plot twist at the end or that one piece of misspoken dialogue. It drove me up the wall.
So I resolved to try and write a perfect story … the essence of a maturation plot. There would be a
young man who was unaware of his potential, a beautiful dragon, a mysterious mentor, and a truly
vicious, sneering, Basil Rathbone villain. Though I started with clichéd characters and situations, I made
them my own by believing in them completely. So what if it’s all been done before? Eragon is deeper
than most fantasies because I truly delve into the characters’ psyches and grapple with the big questions
in life: why are we here, what is our purpose, and by what rules shall we live?
That was my goal. And if perhaps my dart did not always fly as true as wished, I at least grazed the
center of the target.
Eragon has received nothing but five-star reviews on Amazon.com. Publisher’s Weekly calls it, “…
impressive epic fantasy,” and readers have just fallen in love with the story.

6. Tell us about the book cover.
The Eragon book cover took several weeks of hard work to complete. Before I could even set pencil to
paper, I had to figure out how I wanted to depict the dragon Saphira’s eye. I already had a pretty good
idea of how it should appear. The problem was making it look realistic.
For that I found several pictures of crocodile eyes, which I used to establish the basic shape and textures
of the pupil and scales. By modifying the scales, I was able to create a spiny crest over the eyeball as
well as the ridges that rim it. When that was done, a very simple line drawing of the eye was traced onto
a piece of paper proportional to the finished cover.
Finally, I started on the eye. For three days I struggled to give it life, but to no avail. I had messed up on
the lighting when I began, making the drawing appear flat and uninteresting. Realizing what was wrong, I
was forced to abandon my work and try again.
This time I got it right. The eye slowly took shape on my desk, staring at whomever passed by. The

Page 301

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

most tedious and mind-numbing part of the drawing was executing the hundreds of scales. Each one had
to be shaped, shaded, and matched to the smooth gradation of light that covers the entire picture.
Upon completion, the drawing was scanned and then put into Photoshop, where my sister added the
color to the eye. This took a long time to get just right, not only with the complex shading, but also with
the color. The original drawing covered almost an entire 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of paper. However, that was
chopped down so the book’s title and my name could be on a block of white covering the bottom third
of the cover.
I also drew the two maps for Eragon, using dry-ink rollerball pens. Each map covers an 8 1/2 x 11 sheet
of paper.
To see the cover and maps, visit my family’s website.

7. How do you know where to begin your story?
I begin at the moment my protagonist’s life changes. Shakespeare, for example, began Hamlet not with
the death of Hamlet’s father, but the appearance of his father’s ghost, which sparks the events that lead
to the bloody conclusion. Imagine if Hamlet started with Hamlet already bent on the path of revenge …
or vice-versa, when he was still overseas as a student.
A story begins when something happens. That’s the whole point of novels, things happen in them. Now
it’s entirely possible to write a story where nothing seems to be happening until a shocking subtext is
revealed, but you’d better make that revelation a darn good one, to compensate for all the reader’s
preceding boredom. A good example of this is the movie Kiss of the Spider Woman.
The instant something new enters my hero’s life, I start writing. I do take a certain amount of time to set
the stage—which will vary from story to story—but I try to keep it to a minimum.

8. Can you explain how your characters are “born?”
When I first conceive of a book, there are a certain number of characters inherent in the story; I couldn’t
have Eragon without Eragon. Beyond those absolutely necessary to the plot, I add characters to flesh out
the world—such as family and friends of the main actors. These are usually created as I’m writing the first
draft.
Oftentimes I put in characters because Eragon needs certain information. If he’s just entered a village
and wants to find out where someone lives, then he has to ask directions. Voila, a character is born! If he
is interesting enough, then he may have an encore performance later on.
My main characters, however, don’t pop into existence on mere whims. It takes enormous amounts of
effort to figure out what they want, what prevents them from achieving their wants, and what actions they
will take to rectify the situation. And of course their individual stories have to relate to the whole in a
meaningful way. Otherwise, they have no place in the book.

Page 302

9. What is the process you use to name your characters?
I took generous helpings of Norse, Danish, Celtic, Russian, and even Hispanic names, dump them into a
blender and hit frappé. Then I use whatever interesting words get spit out. Or I just invent them outright.
In general I tried to stay with old, mythic names, such as Hrothgar (from Beowulf), Utgard (a Norse
giant), and inventive variants, like Tronjheim
Most of my names are made up, though. Eragon is dragon with one letter changed, or era gone. Saphira
(Sa-FEAR-ah) is a delightful play on sapphire that Mom invented. And the little town Yazuac is really an
anagram for the Yacuza, the Japanese Mafia.
Also, I invented three languages for Eragon, one of which is based on Old Norse. Therefore, each place
name must conform to the grammar of the race that named it. This adds another layer of difficulty
because now I have to think, Okay, who named this: elves, dwarves, humans, or Urgals? Could it be an
elf name translated by the humans? Or perhaps …” You get the idea.

10. How do you build empathy for your characters?
Making readers care for what happens to a fictitious person in a fictitious world with a fictitious name is
hard. Very hard. Empathy is the combination of many different traits.
First, you have to have your characters, even your villain, care deeply about something or someone, else
they’ll be totally unlikable. Or, you can have them care about nothing, but be completely charming, like
Hannibal Lector in Silence of the Lambs. Either way, there has to be a point of connection, even
enjoyment, for readers.
Next, you have to threaten what your character holds dear. Do that an you’ll engender sympathy in most
anyone.
Then, follow your character as he/she struggles to protect what is important to him/her. Pull it off well,
and readers will follow you into even the darkest nightmare.

11. How do you handle the storyline? (Do you use outlines, plot guides, etc?)
Eragon wasn’t my first attempt to write a book. I started several stories before it. Unfortunately, they
always ended up melting into a pile of mush after five or ten pages. It was due to a lack of knowledge of
what to do next.
So instead of just jumping into the middle of Eragon, I spent a month plotting out the entire novel and its
two sequels. That way I never had a doubt or worry about where I was heading, or what my characters
should be doing or saying.
Right now I’m working on Eldest, the sequel to Eragon. For Eldest I have a rough twelve-page
treatment that covers all the scenes I could think of without actually writing the beast. This saves me
hours that might be spent meandering off on a tangent storyline, or trying to solve plot discrepancies after
I’ve already written the first draft. An outline like this is extremely helpful when dealing with a

Page 303

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

multi-volume series, as it helps you keep track of all the different characters, pacing, locations, and the
amount of time it takes to get from point A to point B.
Without a clear vision of the plot, it’s all too easy to get lost in a sea of possibilities. It is good to be
inquisitive and inventive with the situations in your book, but at least by having the original outline, you
can start with confidence.

12. Eragon is classified as a “Fantasy” novel. Do you have any advice to the Writing Etc. subscribers
who write in that genre?
Avoid anachronisms… that is, persons, events, or items that are chronologically misplaced. Never, ever
have your hero climb up a castle wall and encounter razor-wire; They didn’t have razor-wire in the
Middle Ages. Don’t have your hero climb a fruit tree while wearing plate armor. Don’t have your
peasants happy, cheerful, and eating rice in a northern European environment. Under no circumstances
refer to a crossguard as a handle, or have your characters speak with modern slang. I didn’t make these
up. They are in published fantasy titles. Argh!
There’s a perception that fantasy is easy to write. It isn’t. It draws upon some of the deepest mythic
roots of cultures around the world. It’s also highly imitative and derivative. And to make it even harder,
you have to know enough about history to be able to write a semi-accurate historical novel.
My best advice is to make it as realistic as possible. Where does the food come from? What’s the
history of the culture you’re inventing? Do dwarves have lavatories? How has your imaginary religion
seeped into everyday life? Make people believe that your purple pixy dwarves are as deep and complex
as anyone you know.
That’s the whole trick to great fantasy, getting at something deeper than just, “Oh, lets go fetch the magic
watermelon slipper from the Citadel of Doom, hack all the snarling, warty goblins along the way, then be
back in our Idyllic Village for our Rustic Supper.”

13. How did you research this book?
My research included skimming through the Encyclopaedia Britannica many times: reading books on
word-origins, gods from around the world, armor, weapons, and ships, and asking people as many
questions as possible. I also found that making my own knives, arrows, and other assorted pointy items,
helped when writing Eragon.
Research often leads you into areas of knowledge that you wouldn’t otherwise explore. At one time, I
had some questions about bows, so I read several books on the subject and learned that Native
Americans constructed bows out of elk and ram horns. That inspired me, because in Eragon there
arelarge-horned monsters called Urgals. As a result, I added a dwarf with an Urgal-horn bow into
Eldest.

14. Do you write with an overall theme in mind? Explain….

Page 304

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

I had more of a feeling in mind, rather than a theme.
For me, great stories have the power to transform lives through the strength of their vision. I can’t count
the number of times I’ve reached the end of a book or movie and felt a cold tingle worm its way through
my body … because I know that what I’ve just experienced was great. Not good, but great.
With Eragon, it was my goal to capture that sense of awe and wonder. So when a reader finishes the last
scene, the last page, and closes the book, they’ll just go, “Wow!” Everything I did in Eragon was
designed to evoke that reaction at the end.

15. Who is your favorite character and why?
That would be Saphira, the dragon. Why is a bit harder. She was always the genesis of Eragon’s
transformation and growth—I was thrilled by the idea of a young man (Eragon) becoming linked with a
dragon. As I wrote Saphira, I made her the best friend anyone could have: loyal, funny, brave, intelligent,
and noble. She transcended that, however, and became her own person, fiercely independent and
proud.
I love writing about dragons, especially Saphira. Part of what makes her so appealing is that Eragon
cares for her from the moment she hatches. That makes their relationship very different than if he had
suddenly joined up with an age-old dragon. This way, they’re both young and exploring the world for the
first time.
Saphira is so intelligent, there were times I felt like she was looking out at me and saying, “What do you
want!” It’s bit frightening to be at the mercy of an imaginary creature within your own head. You have no
defenses.

16. Have your characters ever surprised you? Explain….
Most of my characters don’t ever surprise me, as they’re so serious. Epic fantasy tends to be like that.
However, I did put my sister, Angela, into Eragon, as an herbalist who loves frogs. Fortunately, she has a
good sense of humor, or else I wouldn’t be writing this!
Every time I write about her, though, I have no idea what she will do next. I know my sister extremely
well, but when I attempt to translate that knowledge to page, it’s impossible to predict what might burst
forth next, since I have such a rich store of memories to draw from.

17. What’s the oddest thing one of your characters has done?
This could also be an answer for the previous question: when Saphira ate a group of Urgals in Eragon! I
couldn’t believe she had done it, but there it was. It’s one of those events that pops out of your
subconscious when you’re working intensely, and afterward you just sit back, shake your head, and say,
“Good grief. I wrote that?”

18. Is there anything a character has done that you’ve regretted?
No. I don’t plot a novel with things that offend or upset me. And if something does creep in that I don’t
approve of, then I either rewrite it during the first draft, or cut it during editing.
On the other hand, there are plenty of word and sentence choices in Eragon that I do regret, and that I
hope to better in Eldest.

19. Tell us about how you promote your book.
Mainly by book signings in bookstores, grocery stores, and farmers’ markets, and presentations in
schools and libraries. Additionally, I make a constant effort to personally contact people who would be
interested in my story, whether through book distribution companies or magazine articles and interviews.
My public appearances are done in medieval costume—billowy red swordsman’s shirt, black
pantaloons, and black lace-up suede boots—which helps garner attention.
Some of my most interesting experiences have occurred during signings. I’ve met candidates for public
office, a Tibetan monk visiting Montana, other writers, professors, students, fathers, mothers—the whole
spectrum of humanity. In addition to signing books, I’ve also signed hands, arms, necks, backs, and even
a couple of chests.
An interesting thing happened while I was in Boise, ID. At a signing, I met a young Hispanic man who
professed not to read English, though he was quite articulate otherwise. He was very interested in Eragon
and all I’d accomplished.
A few minutes later, he bought Eragon as a present for his girlfriend!
Another time I arm wrestled a hefty fellow for the book. I won. And he, too, bought it for his girlfriend.

20. What is one aspect of being a published author that you weren’t prepared for, that surprised you,
that made you think, “Sheesh… I didn’t realize I’d be doing this….”?
All of it, actually. You may realize intellectually what a book signing is, but to really do one is very, very
different. I wasn’t prepared for all the wonderful comments readers have had for Eragon. Nor was I
prepared for being recognized whenever I walk around town.
I’m still getting used to both of those, and in a way I hope I never do. Being a public personality changes
your view of the world. Whether for the better or worse, I’ve yet to see.

21. Tell us about your web site.
Factsource.com is the web site started and run by my father, Kenneth Paolini. It is the site for our
family’s publishing company.

Page 306

On my section of the website, you’ll find a blog of my adventures, pictures, an excerpt from Eragon, a
list of upcoming events, articles and interviews, and my thoughts on art and writing.
Visit my sister’s section to read book reviews that are spicy, scathing, and—occasionally—full of praise.
Highly recommended.

22. Tell us about your art work.
I always doodled as a child, often to my mother’s dismay when she looked at my textbooks. However it
never occurred to me to try drawing or pursue any sort of artistic activity. In fact, drawing assignments
were often the ones I hated the most.
Then one year, a boy about my age stayed with us for a month. He drew a small mountain. For some
reason I took this as a challenge and promptly said, “I can do something better than that!” And I did.
First I drew a couple of mountains of my own, then I copied a dragon from a Tolkien book. Before I
knew what was happening, I saw myself as an “artist”. This of course only made me work harder at it.
The next few years were filled with discovery as I continued to explore my abilities. It was incredible to
uncover a talent within me that I had never suspected existed. I tried working with chalk pastels, oil and
acrylic paint—though this did not always work out because I am partially colorblind—colored pencils,
and ink. I always returned to regular pencils though, as it is the medium I’m most comfortable with.
As you can see if you visit www.factsource.com, I particularly enjoy drawing people, animals, and
sometimes things from my own imagination. I use two mechanical pencils—.3 mm and .9 mm—and I’m
told by the local art supply store that no one but me buys those sizes. Too small and too large I suppose!
Either way, I seem to get good results with them.

23. What is your best piece of advice for aspiring writers?
I can’t inspire passion—that unquantifiable spark that separates B-grade writing from writing that
captures you utterly. What I can do is say this, “Learn everything you can about your craft.”
If you have the will and desire to tell a story, wonderful. Now you have to master the medium, else you’ll
remain an amateur. Read about the craft. Grammar books will help you edit your work. Educate yourself
until you can tell with certainty the difference between good and bad writing. You will know you’ve
succeeded when you can’t read a novel without questioning the author’s choices, because you are aware
of the alternatives, and when your own writing is confident and assured, because you know you can
provide whatever the story requires.

24. What are you reading right now?
Let’s see… I’m in the middle of Conan of Cimmeria, Tolkien’s Ring, Islandia, The Masterharper of
Pern, and The Integral Trees.

Page 307

In the past week-and-a-half, I finished Conan, Grendel, The Butcher’s Wife, Elric of Montilbian,
Chronicals of the Lensmen Vol. 1, Knight Life, The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents, a
volume on the art of William Blake, and a book on criminal organizations and their psychology. And also
a pile of assorted magazines and newspapers.

25. What would you like to be doing in ten years?
In ten years I see myself sitting before a blazing fire with a beautiful wife, a black Oriental Shorthair
purring on our laps, and behind us, on the floor-to-ceiling bookshelf, the complete volumes of the
Inheritance trilogy, and one or two more novels besides.

26. Do you have any closing thoughts you’d like to share with the Writing Etc. subscribers?
Avoid eating earwax, beware boiled cabbage, don’t slip on discarded pronouns, and above all, order
Eragon from your local bookstore, or on-line amazon.com or factsource.com.
If you do, you’ll be treated to an extraordinary adventure—one that will sweep you into an exotic land
full of mystery, passion, and wonder. While writing Eragon, I often felt like a child surrounded by
undiscovered treasures … and I hope you share that experience.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Synopsis of

Eragon ,
Book One of Inheritance

Eragon—a fifteen-year-old farmboy—is shocked when a polished blue stone appears before him in the
range of mountains known as the Spine. Eragon takes the stone to the farm where he lives with his uncle,
Gar-row, and his cousin, Roran. Garrow and his late wife, Marian, have raised Eragon. Nothing is
known of his father; his mother, Selena, was Garrow’s sister and has not been seen since Eragon’s birth.
Later, the stone cracks open and a baby dragon emerges. When Eragon touches her, a silvery mark
appears on his palm, and an irrevocable bond is forged between their minds, making Eragon one of the
legendary Dragon Riders.
The Dragon Riders were created thousands of years earlier in the af-termath of the elves’ great war with
the dragons, in order to ensure that hostilities would never again afflict their two races. The Riders
became peacekeepers, educators, healers, natural philosophers, and the greatest of spellweavers—since
being joined with a dragon makes one a magician. Under their guidance and protection, the land enjoyed
a golden age.
When humans arrived in Alagaësia, they too were added to this elite order. After many years of peace,
the monstrous and warlike Urgals killed the dragon of a young human Rider named Galbatorix. Driven
mad by the loss and by his elders’ refusal to provide him with another dragon, Galbatorix set out to
topple the Riders.
He stole another dragon—whom he named Shruikan and forced to serve him through certain black
spells—and gathered around himself a group of thirteen traitors: the Forsworn. With the help of those
cruel dis-ciples, Galbatorix threw down the Riders; killed their leader, Vrael; and declared himself king
over Alagaësia. In this, Galbatorix was only partly successful, for the elves and dwarves remain
autonomous in their secret haunts, and some humans have established an independent country, Surda, in
the south of Alagaësia. A stalemate has existed between these factions for twenty years, preceded by
eighty years of open conflict brought about by the destruction of the Riders.

It is into this fragile political situation, then, that Eragon is thrust. He fears he is in mortal danger—it is
common knowledge that Galbatorix killed every Rider who would not swear loyalty to him—and so
Eragon hides the dragon from his family as he raises her. During this time, Eragon names the creature
Saphira, after a dragon mentioned by the village story-teller, Brom. Soon Roran leaves the farm for a job
that will allow him to earn enough money to marry Katrina, the butcher’s daughter.
When Saphira stands taller than Eragon, two menacing, beetle-like strangers called the Ra’zac arrive in
Carvahall, searching for the stone that was her egg. Frightened, Saphira kidnaps Eragon and flies into the
Spine. Eragon manages to convince her to turn back, but by then his home has been obliterated by the
Ra’zac. Eragon finds Garrow in the wreckage, tor-tured and badly wounded.
Garrow dies soon afterward, and Eragon vows to track down and kill the Ra’zac. Eragon is accosted
by Brom, who knows of Saphira’s existence and asks to accompany Eragon for reasons of his own.
After Eragon agrees, Brom gives him the sword Zar’roc, which was once a Rider’s blade, though he
refuses to say how he acquired it.
Eragon learns much from Brom during their travels, including how to fight with swords and use magic.
Eventually, they lose the Ra’zac’s trail and visit the city of Teirm, where Brom believes his old friend Jeod
can help locate their lair.
In Teirm, the eccentric herbalist Angela tells Eragon’s fortune, predict-ing mighty powers struggling to
control his destiny; an epic romance with one of noble birth; the fact that he will one day leave Alagaësia,
never to return; and a betrayal from within his family. Her companion, the were-cat Solembum, also gives
him some words of advice. Then Eragon, Brom, and Saphira depart for Dras-Leona, where they hope to
find the Ra’zac.
Brom finally reveals that he is an agent of the Varden—a rebel group dedicated to overthrowing
Galbatorix—and that he had been hiding in Eragon’s village, waiting for a new Dragon Rider to appear.
Brom also ex-plains that twenty years ago, he and Jeod stole Saphira’s egg from Galba-torix. In the
process, Brom killed Morzan, first and last of the Forsworn. Only two other dragon eggs still exist, both
of which remain in Galba-torix’s possession.
Near Dras-Leona, the Ra’zac waylay Eragon and his companions, and Brom is mortally wounded while
protecting Eragon. The Ra’zac are driven away by a mysterious young man named Murtagh, who says
he’s been tracking the Ra’zac. Brom dies the following night. With his last breath, he confesses that he
was once a Rider and his slain dragon was also named Saphira. Eragon buries Brom in a tomb of
sandstone, which Saphira transmutes into pure diamond.
Without Brom, Eragon and Saphira decide to join the Varden. By ill chance, Eragon is captured at the
city of Gil’ead and brought to the Shade Durza, Galbatorix’s right-hand man. With Murtagh’s help,
Eragon escapes from prison, bringing along with him the unconscious elf Arya, another captive. By this
point, Eragon and Murtagh have become great friends.
With her mind, Arya tells Eragon that she has been ferrying Saphira’s egg between the elves and the
Varden, in the hopes that it might hatch for one of their children. However, during her last trip, she was
am-bushed by Durza and forced to send the egg elsewhere with magic, which is how it came to Eragon.
Now Arya is seriously wounded and re-quires the Varden’s medical help. Using mental images, she
shows Eragon how to find the rebels. An epic chase ensues. Eragon and his friends trav-erse almost four
hundred miles in eight days. They are pursued by a con-tingent of Urgals, who trap them in the towering
Beor Mountains. Murtagh, who had not wanted to go to the Varden, is forced to tell Er-agon that he is

Page 314

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

the son of Morzan.
Murtagh, however, has denounced his father’s deeds and fled Galba-torix’s patronage to seek his own
destiny. He shows Eragon a great scar across his back, inflicted when Morzan threw his sword, Zar’roc,
at him when he was just a child. Thus, Eragon learns his sword once belonged to Murtagh’s father, he
who betrayed the Riders to Galbatorix and slaugh-tered many of his former comrades.
Just before they are overwhelmed by the Urgals, Eragon and his friends are rescued by the Varden, who
seem to appear out of the very stone. It turns out that the rebels are based in Farthen Dûr, a hollow
mountain ten miles high and ten miles across. It is also home to the dwarves’ capital, Tronjheim. Once
inside, Eragon is taken to Ajihad, leader of the Varden, while Murtagh is imprisoned because of his
parentage. Ajihad explains many things to Eragon, including that the Varden, elves, and dwarves had
agreed that when a new Rider appeared, he or she would initially be trained by Brom and then sent to the
elves to complete the instruction. Eragon must now decide whether to follow this course.
Eragon meets with the dwarf king, Hrothgar, and Ajihad’s daughter, Nasuada; is tested by the Twins,
two bald and rather nasty magicians who serve Ajihad; spars with Arya once she has recovered; and
again en-counters Angela and Solembum, who have joined the Varden. Eragon and Saphira also bless
one of the Varden’s orphan babies.
Eragon’s stay is disrupted by news of an Urgal army approaching through the dwarves’ tunnels. In the
battle that follows, Eragon is sepa-rated from Saphira and forced to fight Durza alone. Far stronger than
any human, Durza easily defeats Eragon, slashing open his back from shoulder to hip. At that moment,
Saphira and Arya break the roof of the cham-ber—a sixty-foot-wide star sapphire—distracting Durza
long enough for Eragon to stab him through the heart. Freed from Durza’s spells, the Ur-gals are driven
back into the tunnels.
While Eragon lies unconscious after the battle, he is telepathically con-tacted by a being who identifies
himself as Togira Ikonoka—the Cripple Who Is Whole. He offers answers to all of Eragon’s questions
and urges Eragon to seek him in Ellesméra, where the elves live.
When Eragon wakes, he finds that, despite Angela’s best efforts, he has been left with a huge scar
similar to Murtagh’s. Dismayed, he also realizes that he only slew Durza through sheer luck and that he
desperately needs more training.
And at the end of Book One, Eragon decides that, yes, he will find this Togira Ikonoka and learn from
him. For gray-eyed Destiny now weaves apace, the first resounding note of war echoes across the land,
and the time fast approaches when Eragon shall have to step forth and confront his one, true enemy: King
Galbatorix.
A TWIN DISASTER

The songs of the dead are the lamentations of the living.
So thought Eragon as he stepped over a twisted and hacked Urgal, lis-tening to the keening of women
who removed loved ones from the blood-muddied ground of Farthen Dûr. Behind him Saphira delicately
skirted the corpse, her glittering blue scales the only color in the gloom that filled the hollow mountain.
It was three days since the Varden and dwarves had fought the Urgals for possession of Tronjheim, the

Page 315

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

mile-high, conical city nestled in the center of Farthen Dûr, but the battlefield was still strewn with
carnage. The sheer number of bodies had stymied their attempts to bury the dead. In the distance, a
mountainous fire glowed sullenly by Farthen Dûr’s wall where the Urgals were being burned. No burial
or honored resting place for them.
Since waking to find his wound healed by Angela, Eragon had tried three times to assist in the recovery
effort. On each occasion he had been racked by terrible pains that seemed to explode from his spine.
The heal-ers gave him various potions to drink. Arya and Angela said that he was perfectly sound.
Nevertheless, he hurt. Nor could Saphira help, only share his pain as it rebounded across their mental
link.
Eragon ran a hand over his face and looked up at the stars showing through Farthen Dûr’s distant top,
which were smudged with sooty smoke from the pyre. Three days. Three days since he had killed
Durza; three days since people began calling him Shadeslayer; three days since the remnants of the
sorcerer’s consciousness had ravaged his mind and he had been saved by the mysterious Togira
Ikonoka, the Cripple Who Is Whole. He had told no one about that vision but Saphira. Fighting Durza
and the dark spirits that controlled him had transformed Eragon; although for better or for worse he was
still unsure. He felt fragile, as if a sudden shock would shatter his reconstructed body and consciousness.
And now he had come to the site of the combat, driven by a morbid desire to see its aftermath. Upon
arriving, he found nothing but the un-comfortable presence of death and decay, not the glory that heroic
songs had led him to expect.
Before his uncle, Garrow, was slain by the Ra’zac months earlier, the brutality that Eragon had
witnessed between the humans, dwarves, and Urgals would have destroyed him. Now it numbed him.
He had realized, with Saphira’s help, that the only way to stay rational amid such pain was to do things.
Beyond that, he no longer believed that life possessed inher-ent meaning—not after seeing men torn apart
by the Kull, a race of giant Urgals, and the ground a bed of thrashing limbs and the dirt so wet with blood
it soaked through the soles of his boots. If any honor existed in war, he concluded, it was in fighting to
protect others from harm.
He bent and plucked a tooth, a molar, from the dirt. Bouncing it on his palm, he and Saphira slowly
made a circuit through the trampled plain. They stopped at its edge when they noticed
Jörmundur—Ajihad’s second in command in the Varden—hurrying toward them from Tronjheim. When
he came near, Jörmundur bowed, a gesture Eragon knew he would never have made just days before.
“I’m glad I found you in time, Eragon.” He clutched a parchment note in one hand. “Ajihad is returning,
and he wants you to be there when he arrives. The others are already waiting for him by Tronjheim’s
west gate. We’ll have to hurry to get there in time.”
Eragon nodded and headed toward the gate, keeping a hand on Saphira. Ajihad had been gone most of
the three days, hunting down Urgals who had managed to escape into the dwarf tunnels that
honeycombed the stone beneath the Beor Mountains. The one time Eragon had seen him between
expeditions, Ajihad was in a rage over discovering that his daughter, Nasuada, had disobeyed his orders
to leave with the other women and children before the battle. Instead, she had secretly fought among the
Varden’s archers.
Murtagh and the Twins had accompanied Ajihad: the Twins because it was dangerous work and the
Varden’s leader needed the protection of their magical skills, and Murtagh because he was eager to
continue prov-ing that he bore the Varden no ill will. It surprised Eragon how much people’s attitudes
toward Murtagh had changed, considering that Murtagh’s father was the Dragon Rider Morzan, who had

Page 316

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

betrayed the Riders to Galbatorix. Even though Murtagh despised his father and was loyal to Eragon, the
Varden had not trusted him. But now, no one was willing to waste energy on a petty hate when so much
work remained. Eragon missed talking with Murtagh and looked forward to discussing all that had
happened, once he returned.
As Eragon and Saphira rounded Tronjheim, a small group became visi-ble in the pool of lantern light
before the timber gate. Among them were Orik—the dwarf shifting impatiently on his stout legs—and
Arya. The white bandage around her upper arm gleamed in the darkness, reflecting a faint highlight onto
the bottom of her hair. Eragon felt a strange thrill, as he always did when he saw the elf. She looked at
him and Saphira, green eyes flashing, then continued watching for Ajihad.
By breaking Isidar Mithrim—the great star sapphire that was sixty feet across and carved in the shape of
a rose—Arya had allowed Eragon to kill Durza and so win the battle. Still, the dwarves were furious with
her for destroying their most prized treasure. They refused to move the sap-phire’s remains, leaving them
in a massive circle inside Tronjheim’s cen-tral chamber. Eragon had walked through the splintered
wreckage and shared the dwarves’ sorrow for all the lost beauty.
He and Saphira stopped by Orik and looked out at the empty land that surrounded Tronjheim,
extending to Farthen Dûr’s base five miles away in each direction. “Where will Ajihad come from?”
asked Eragon.
Orik pointed at a cluster of lanterns staked around a large tunnel open-ing a couple of miles away. “He
should be here soon.”
Eragon waited patiently with the others, answering comments directed at him but preferring to speak
with Saphira in the peace of his mind. The quiet that filled Farthen Dûr suited him.
Half an hour passed before motion flickered in the distant tunnel. A group of ten men climbed out onto
the ground, then turned and helped up as many dwarves. One of the men—Eragon assumed it was
Ajihad— raised a hand, and the warriors assembled behind him in two straight lines. At a signal, the
formation marched proudly toward Tronjheim.
Before they went more than five yards, the tunnel behind them swarmed with a flurry of activity as more
figures jumped out. Eragon squinted, unable to see clearly from so far away.
Those are Urgals!exclaimed Saphira, her body tensing like a drawn bowstring.
Eragon did not question her. “Urgals!” he cried, and leaped onto Saphira, berating himself for leaving his
sword, Zar’roc, in his room. No one had expected an attack now that the Urgal army had been driven
away.
His wound twinged as Saphira lifted her azure wings, then drove them down and jumped forward,
gaining speed and altitude each second. Be-low them, Arya ran toward the tunnel, nearly keeping apace
with Saphira. Orik trailed her with several men, while Jörmundur sprinted back toward the barracks.
Eragon was forced to watch helplessly as the Urgals fell on the rear of Ajihad’s warriors; he could not
work magic over such a distance. The monsters had the advantage of surprise and quickly cut down four
men, forcing the rest of the warriors, men and dwarves alike, to cluster around Ajihad in an attempt to
protect him. Swords and axes clashed as the groups pressed together. Light flashed from one of the
Twins, and an Ur-gal fell, clutching the stump of his severed arm.

Page 317

For a minute, it seemed the defenders would be able to resist the Ur-gals, but then a swirl of motion
disturbed the air, like a faint band of mist wrapping itself around the combatants. When it cleared, only
four warri-ors were standing: Ajihad, the Twins, and Murtagh. The Urgals converged on them, blocking
Eragon’s view as he stared with rising horror and fear.
No! No! No!
Before Saphira could reach the fight, the knot of Urgals streamed back to the tunnel and scrambled
underground, leaving only prone forms be-hind.
The moment Saphira touched down, Eragon vaulted off, then faltered, overcome by grief and anger. I
can’t do this. It reminded him too much of when he had returned to the farm to find his uncle Garrow
dying. Fight-ing back his dread with every step, he began to search for survivors.
The site was eerily similar to the battlefield he had inspected earlier, except that here the blood was
fresh.
In the center of the massacre lay Ajihad, his breastplate rent with nu-merous gashes, surrounded by five
Urgals he had slain. His breath still came in ragged gasps. Eragon knelt by him and lowered his face so
his tears would not land on the leader’s ruined chest. No one could heal such wounds. Running up to
them, Arya paused and stopped, her face trans-formed with sorrow when she saw that Ajihad could not
be saved.
“Eragon.” The name slipped from Ajihad’s lips—no more than a whis-per.
“Yes, I am here.”
“Listen to me, Eragon.... I have one last command for you.” Eragon leaned closer to catch the dying
man’s words. “You must promise me something: promise that you... won’t let the Varden fall into chaos.
They are the only hope for resisting the Empire.... They must be kept strong. You must promise me.”
“I promise.”
“Then peace be with you, Eragon Shadeslayer....” With his last breath, Ajihad closed his eyes, setting his
noble face in repose, and died.
Eragon bowed his head. He had trouble breathing past the lump in his throat, which was so hard it hurt.
Arya blessed Ajihad in a ripple of the ancient language, then said in her musical voice, “Alas, his death
will cause much strife. He is right, you must do all you can to avert a struggle for power. I will assist
where possible.”
Unwilling to speak, Eragon gazed at the rest of the bodies. He would have given anything to be
elsewhere. Saphira nosed one of the Urgals and said, This should not have happened. It is an evil
doing, and all the worse for coming when we should be safe and victorious . She examined another
body, then swung her head around. Where are the Twins and Murtagh? They’re not among the
dead.
Eragon scanned the corpses. You’re right! Elation surged within him as he hurried to the tunnel’s mouth.
There pools of thickening blood filled the hollows in the worn marble steps like a series of black mirrors,
glossy and oval, as if several torn bodies had been dragged down them. The Ur-gals must have taken
them! But why? They don’t keep prisoners or hostages. Despair instantly returned. It doesn’t matter.

We can’t pursue them without reinforcements; you wouldn’t even fit through the opening.
They may still be alive. Would you abandon them?
What do you expect me to do? The dwarf tunnels are an endless maze! I would only get lost. And I
couldn’t catch Urgals on foot, though Arya might be able to.
Then ask her to.
Arya!Eragon hesitated, torn between his desire for action and his loath-ing to put her in danger. Still, if
any one person in the Varden could han-dle the Urgals, it was she. With a groan, he explained what they
had found.
Arya’s slanted eyebrows met in a frown. “It makes no sense.”
“Will you pursue them?”
She stared at him for a heavy moment. “Wiol ono.” For you. Then she bounded forward, sword flashing
in her hand as she dove into the earth’s belly.
Burning with frustration, Eragon settled cross-legged by Ajihad, keeping watch over the body. He could
barely assimilate the fact that Ajihad was dead and Murtagh missing. Murtagh . Son of one of the
Forsworn—the thirteen Riders who had helped Galbatorix destroy their order and anoint himself king of
Alagaësia—and Eragon’s friend. At times Eragon had wished Murtagh gone, but now that he had been
forcibly removed, the loss left an unexpected void. He sat motionless as Orik approached with the men.
When Orik saw Ajihad, he stamped his feet and swore in Dwarvish, swinging his ax into the body of an
Urgal. The men only stood in shock. Rubbing a pinch of dirt between his callused hands, the dwarf
growled, “Ah, now a hornet’s nest has broken; we’ll have no peace among the Varden after this.
Barzûln, but this makes things complicated. Were you in time to hear his last words?”
Eragon glanced at Saphira. “They must wait for the right person before I’ll repeat them.”
“I see. And where’d be Arya?”
Eragon pointed.
Orik swore again, then shook his head and sat on his heels.
Jörmundur soon arrived with twelve ranks of six warriors each. He mo-tioned for them to wait outside
the radius of bodies while he proceeded onward alone. He bent and touched Ajihad on the shoulder.
“How can fate be this cruel, my old friend? I would have been here sooner if not for the size of this
cursed mountain, and then you might have been saved. Instead, we are wounded at the height of our
triumph.”
Eragon softly told him about Arya and the disappearance of the Twins and Murtagh.
“She should not have gone,” said Jörmundur, straightening, “but we can do naught about it now. Guards
will be posted here, but it will be at least an hour before dwarf guides can be found for another
expedition into the tunnels.”

“I’d be willing to lead it,” offered Orik.
Jörmundur looked back at Tronjheim, his gaze distant. “No, Hrothgar will need you now; someone else
will have to go. I’m sorry, Eragon, but everyone important must stay here until Ajihad’s successor is
chosen. Arya will have to fend for herself.... We could not overtake her anyway.”
Eragon nodded, accepting the inevitable.
Jörmundur swept his gaze around before saying so all could hear, “Aji-had has died a warrior’s death!
Look, he slew five Urgals where a lesser man might have been overwhelmed by one. We will give him
every honor and hope his spirit pleases the gods. Bear him and our companions back to Tronjheim on
your shields... and do not be ashamed to let your tears be seen, for this is a day of sorrow that all will
remember. May we soon have the privilege of sheathing our blades in the monsters who have slain our
leader!”
As one, the warriors knelt, baring their heads in homage to Ajihad. Then they stood and reverently lifted
him on their shields so he lay be-tween their shoulders. Already many of the Varden wept, tears flowing
into beards, yet they did not disgrace their duty and allow Ajihad to fall. With solemn steps, they
marched back to Tronjheim, Saphira and Eragon in the middle of the procession.
THE COUNCIL OF ELDERS

Eragon roused himself and rolled to the edge of the bed, looking about the room, which was suffused
with the dim glow of a shuttered lantern. He sat and watched Saphira sleep. Her muscled sides expanded
and con-tracted as the great bellows of her lungs forced air through her scaled nostrils. Eragon thought of
the raging inferno that she could now sum-mon at will and send roaring out of her maw. It was an
awesome sight when flames hot enough to melt metal rushed past her tongue and ivory teeth without
harming them. Since she first breathed fire during his fight with Durza—while plunging toward them from
the top of Tronjheim— Saphira had been insufferably proud of her new talent. She was con-stantly
releasing little jets of flame, and she took every opportunity to light objects ablaze.
Because Isidar Mithrim was shattered, Eragon and Saphira had been un-able to remain in the
dragonhold above it. The dwarves had given them quarters in an old guardroom on Tronjheim’s bottom
level. It was a large room, but with a low ceiling and dark walls.
Anguish gripped Eragon as he remembered the events of the previous day. Tears filled his eyes, spilling
over, and he caught one on his hand. They had heard nothing from Arya until late that evening, when she
emerged from the tunnel, weary and footsore. Despite her best efforts— and all her magic—the Urgals
had escaped her. “I found these,” she said. Then she revealed one of the Twins’ purple robes, torn and
bloodied, and Murtagh’s tunic and both his leather gauntlets. “They were strewn along the edge of a
black chasm, the bottom of which no tunnel reaches. The Urgals must have stolen their armor and
weapons and thrown the bodies into the pit. I scryed both Murtagh and the Twins, and saw naught but
the shadows of the abyss.” Her eyes met Eragon’s. “I’m sorry; they are gone.”
Now, in the confines of his mind, Eragon mourned Murtagh. It was a dreadful, creeping feeling of loss
and horror made worse by the fact that he had grown ever more familiar with it in past months.
As he stared at the tear in his hand—a small, glistening dome—he de-cided to scry the three men
himself. He knew it was a desperate and fu-tile prospect, but he had to try in order to convince himself

Page 320

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

that Murtagh was really gone. Even so, he was uncertain if he wanted to succeed where Arya had failed,
if it would make him feel any better to catch a glimpse of Murtagh lying broken at the base of a cliff deep
below Farthen Dûr.
He whispered, “Draumr kópa.” Darkness enveloped the liquid, turning it into a small dot of night on his
silver palm. Movement flickered through it, like the swish of a bird across a clouded moon... then
nothing.
Another tear joined the first.
Eragon took a deep breath, leaned back, and let calm settle over him. Since recovering from Durza’s
wound, he had realized—humbling as it was—that he had prevailed only through sheer luck. If I ever
face another Shade, or the Ra’zac, or Galbatorix, I must be stronger if I expect to win. Brom could
have taught me more, I know he could have. But without him, I have but one choice: the elves.
Saphira’s breathing quickened, and she opened her eyes, yawning ex-pansively. Good morning, little
one.
Is it?He looked down and leaned on his hands, compressing the mat-tress. It’s terrible... Murtagh and
Ajihad... Why didn’t sentries in the tun-nels warn us of the Urgals? They shouldn’t have been able
to trail Ajihad’s group without being noticed.... Arya was right, it doesn’t make sense.
We may never know the truth,said Saphira gently. She stood, wings brushing the ceiling. You need to
eat, then we must discover what the Varden are planning. We can’t waste time; a new leader
could be chosen within hours.
Eragon agreed, thinking of how they had left everyone yesterday: Orik rushing off to give King Hrothgar
the tidings, Jörmundur taking Ajihad’s body to a place where it would rest until the funeral, and Arya,
who stood alone and watched the goings-on.
Eragon rose and strapped on Zar’roc and his bow, then bent and lifted Snowfire’s saddle. A line of pain
sheared through his torso, driving him to the floor, where he writhed, scrabbling at his back. It felt like he
was be-ing sawed in half. Saphira growled as the ripping sensation reached her. She tried to soothe him
with her own mind but was unable to alleviate his suffering. Her tail instinctually lifted, as if to fight.
It took minutes before the fit subsided and the last throb faded away, leaving Eragon gasping. Sweat
drenched his face, making his hair stick and his eyes sting. He reached back and gingerly fingered the top
of his scar. It was hot and inflamed and sensitive to touch. Saphira lowered her nose and touched him on
the arm. Oh, little one....
It was worse this time,he said, staggering upright. She let him lean against her as he wiped off the sweat
with a rag, then he tentatively stepped toward the door.
Are you strong enough to go?
We have to. We’re obliged as dragon and Rider to make a public choice regarding the next head of the
Varden, and perhaps even influence the selec-tion. I won’t ignore the strength of our position; we now
wield great authority within the Varden. At least the Twins aren’t here to grab the position for themselves.
That’s the only good in the situation.
Very well, but Durza should suffer a thousand years of torture for what he did to you.

Page 321

He grunted. Just stay close to me.
Together they made their way through Tronjheim, toward the nearest kitchen. In the corridors and
hallways, people stopped and bowed to them, murmuring “Argetlam” or “Shadeslayer.” Even dwarves
made the motions, though not as often. Eragon was struck by the somber, haunted expressions of the
humans and the dark clothing they wore to display their sadness. Many women were dressed entirely in
black, lace veils cov-ering their faces.
In the kitchen, Eragon brought a stone platter of food to a low table. Saphira watched him carefully in
case he should have another attack. Several people tried to approach him, but she lifted a lip and
growled, sending them scurrying away. Eragon picked at his food and pretended to ignore the
disturbances. Finally, trying to divert his thoughts from Murtagh, he asked, Who do you think has the
means to take control of the Varden now that Ajihad and the Twins are gone?
She hesitated. It’s possible you could, if Ajihad’s last words were inter-preted as a blessing to
secure the leadership. Almost no one would oppose you. However, that does not seem a wise path
to take. I see only trouble in that direction.
I agree. Besides, Arya wouldn’t approve, and she could be a dangerous enemy. Elves can’t lie in the
ancient language, but they have no such inhibi-tion in ours—she could deny that Ajihad ever uttered those
words if it served her purposes. No, I don’t want the position.... What about Jörmun-dur?
Ajihad called him his right-hand man. Unfortunately, we know little about him or the Varden’s other
leaders. Such a short time has passed since we came here. We will have to make our judgment on our
feelings and im-pressions, without the benefit of history.
Eragon pushed his fish around a lump of mashed tubers. Don’t forget Hrothgar and the dwarf clans;
they won’t be quiet in this. Except for Arya, the elves have no say in the succession—a decision
will be made before word of this even reaches them. But the dwarves can’t be—won’t be—
ignored. Hrothgar favors the Varden, but if enough clans oppose him, he might be maneuvered
into backing someone unsuited for the command.
And who might that be?
A person easily manipulated.He closed his eyes and leaned back. It could be anyone in Farthen Dûr,
anyone at all.
For a long while, they both considered the issues facing them. Then Saphira said, Eragon, there is
someone here to see you. I can’t scare him away.
Eh?He cracked his eyes open, squinting as they adjusted to the light. A pale-looking youth stood by the
table. The boy eyed Saphira like he was afraid she would try to eat him. “What is it?” asked Eragon, not
unkindly.
The boy started, flustered, then bowed. “You have been summoned, Argetlam, to speak before the
Council of Elders.”
“Who are they?”
The question confused the boy even more. “The—the council is... are... people we—that is, the

Page 322

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Varden—choose to speak on our behalf to Aji-had. They were his trusted advisers, and now they wish
to see you. It is a great honor!” He finished with a quick smile.
“Are you to lead me to them?”
“Yes, I am.”
Saphira looked at Eragon questioningly. He shrugged and left the un-eaten food, motioning for the boy
to show the way. As they walked, the boy admired Zar’roc with bright eyes, then looked down shyly.
“What are you called?” asked Eragon.
“Jarsha, sir.”
“That’s a good name. You carried your message well; you should be proud.” Jarsha beamed and
bounced forward.
They reached a convex stone door, which Jarsha pushed open. The room inside was circular, with a sky
blue dome decorated with constella-tions. A round marble table, inlaid with the crest of Dûrgrimst
Ingei-tum—an upright hammer ringed by twelve stars—stood in the center of the chamber. Seated there
were Jörmundur and two other men, one tall and one broad; a woman with pinched lips, close-set eyes,
and elaborately painted cheeks; and a second woman with an immense pile of gray hair above a matronly
face, belied by a dagger hilt peeking out of the vast hills of her bodice.
“You may go,” said Jörmundur to Jarsha, who quickly bowed and left.
Conscious that he was being watched, Eragon surveyed the room, then seated himself in the middle of a
swath of empty chairs, so that the council members were forced to turn in their seats in order to look at
him. Saphira hunkered directly behind him; he could feel her hot breath on the top of his head.
Jörmundur got halfway up to make a slight bow, then reseated himself. “Thank you for coming, Eragon,
even though you have suffered your own loss. This is Umérth,” the tall man; “Falberd,” the broad one;
“and Sabrae and Elessari,” the two women.
Eragon inclined his head, then asked, “And what of the Twins, were they part of this council?”
Sabrae shook her head sharply and tapped a long fingernail on the table. “They had naught to do with
us. They were slime—worse than slime— leeches that worked only for their own benefit. They had no
desire to serve the Varden. Thus, they had no place in this council.” Eragon could smell her perfume all
the way on the other side of the table; it was thick and oily, like a rotting flower. He hid a smile at the
thought.
“Enough. We’re not here to discuss the Twins,” said Jörmundur. “We face a crisis that must be dealt
with quickly and effectively. If we don’t choose Ajihad’s successor, someone else will. Hrothgar has
already con-tacted us to convey his condolences. While he was more than courteous, he is sure to be
forming his own plans even as we speak. We must also consider Du Vrangr Gata, the magic users. Most
of them are loyal to the Varden, but it’s difficult to predict their actions even in the best of times. They
might decide to oppose our authority for their own advantage. That is why we need your assistance,
Eragon, to provide the legitimacy re-quired by whoever is to take Ajihad’s place.”
Falberd heaved himself up, planting his meaty hands on the table. “The five of us have already decided

Page 323

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

whom to support. There is no doubt among us that it is the right person. But,” he raised a thick finger,
“before we reveal who it is, you must give us your word of honor that whether you agree or disagree with
us, nothing of our discussion will leave this room.”
Why would they want that?Eragon asked Saphira.
I don’t know,she said, snorting. It might be a trap.... It’s a gamble you’ll have to take. Remember,
though, they haven’t asked me to pledge anything. I can always tell Arya what they say, if needed.
Silly of them, forgetting that I’m as intelligent as any human.
Pleased with the thought, Eragon said, “Very well, you have my word. Now, who do you want to lead
the Varden?”
“Nasuada.”
Surprised, Eragon dropped his gaze, thinking quickly. He had not con-sidered Nasuada for the
succession because of her youth—she was just a few years older than Eragon. No real reason existed, of
course, for her not to lead, but why would the Council of Elders want her to? How would they benefit?
He remembered Brom’s advice and tried to examine the issue from every angle, knowing that he had to
decide swiftly.
Nasuada has steel in her,observed Saphira. She would be like her father.
Maybe, but what’s their reason for picking her?
To gain time, Eragon asked, “Why not you, Jörmundur? Ajihad called you his right-hand man. Doesn’t
that mean you should take his place now that he’s gone?”
A current of unease ran through the council: Sabrae sat even straighter, hands clasped before her;
Umérth and Falberd glanced at each other darkly, while Elessari just smiled, the dagger hilt jiggling on her
chest.
“Because,” said Jörmundur, selecting his words with care, “Ajihad was speaking of military matters then,
nothing more. Also, I am a member of this council, which only has power because we support one
another. It would be foolish and dangerous for one of us to raise himself above the rest.” The council
relaxed as he finished, and Elessari patted Jörmundur on the forearm.
Ha!exclaimed Saphira. He probably would have taken power if it were possible to force the others
to back him. Just look how they eye him. He’s like a wolf in their midst.
A wolf in a pack of jackals, perhaps.
“Does Nasuada have enough experience?” inquired Eragon.
Elessari pressed herself against the table’s edge as she leaned forward. “I had already been here for
seven years when Ajihad joined the Varden. I’ve watched Nasuada grow up from a darling girl to the
woman she is. A trifle light-headed occasionally, but a good figure to lead the Varden. The people will
love her. Now I,” she patted herself affectionately on the bosom, “and my friends will be here to guide
her through these troubled times. She will never be without someone to show her the way. Inexpe-rience
should be no barrier to her taking her rightful position.”

Page 324

Understanding flooded Eragon. They want a puppet!
“Ajihad’s funeral will be held in two days,” broke in Umérth. “Directly afterward, we plan to appoint
Nasuada as our new leader. We have yet to ask her, but she will surely agree. We want you to be
present at the appointing—no one, not even Hrothgar, can complain about it then— and to swear fealty
to the Varden. That will give back the confidence Ajihad’s death has stolen from the people, and prevent
anyone from try-ing to splinter this organization.”
Fealty!
Saphira quickly touched Eragon’s mind. Notice, they don’t want you to swear to Nasuada—just to
the Varden.
Yes, and they want to be the ones to appoint Nasuada, which would indi-cate that the council is more
powerful than she. They could have asked Arya or us to appoint her, but that would mean
acknowledging whoever did it as above everyone in the Varden. This way, they assert their superiority
over Nasuada, gain control over us through fealty, and also get the benefit of having a Rider endorse
Nasuada in public.
“What happens,” he asked, “if I decide not to accept your offer?”
“Offer?” Falberd asked, seeming puzzled. “Why, nothing, of course. Only it would be a terrible slight if
you’re not present when Nasuada is chosen. If the hero of the battle of Farthen Dûr ignores her, what
can she think but that a Rider has spited her and found the Varden unworthy to serve? Who could bear
such a shame?”
The message could have been no clearer. Eragon clenched Zar’roc’s pommel under the table, yearning
to scream that it was unnecessary to force him to support the Varden, that he would have done it
anyway. Now, however, he instinctively wanted to rebel, to elude the shackles they were trying to place
on him. “Since Riders are so highly thought of, I could decide that my efforts would be best spent guiding
the Varden myself.”
The mood in the room hardened. “That would be unwise,” stated Sa-brae.
Eragon combed his mind for a way to escape the situation. With Ajihad gone, said Saphira, it may be
impossible to remain independent of every group, as he wanted us to. We cannot anger the
Varden, and if this council is to control it once Nasuada is in place, then we must appease them.
Re-member, they act as much out of self-preservation as we do.
But what will they want us to do once we are in their grasp? Will they re-spect the Varden’s pact with
the elves and send us to Ellesméra for training, or command otherwise? Jörmundur strikes me as an
honorable man, but the rest of the council? I can’t tell.
Saphira brushed the top of his head with her jaw. Agree to be at this ceremony with Nasuada; that
much I think we must do. As for swearing fe-alty, see if you can avoid acquiescing. Perhaps
something will occur between now and then that will change our position... Arya may have a
solution.
Without warning, Eragon nodded and said, “As you wish; I shall attend Nasuada’s appointment.”
Jörmundur looked relieved. “Good, good. Then we have only one more matter to deal with before you

Page 325

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

go: Nasuada’s acceptance. There’s no rea-son to delay, with all of us here. I’ll send for her immediately.
And Arya too—we need the elves’ approval before making this decision public. It shouldn’t be difficult
to procure; Arya cannot go against our council and you, Eragon. She will have to agree with our
judgment.”
“Wait,” commanded Elessari, a steely glint in her eyes. “Your word, though, Rider. Will you give it in
fealty at the ceremony?”
“Yes, you must do that,” agreed Falberd. “The Varden would be dis-graced if we couldn’t provide you
every protection.”
A nice way to put it!
It was worth a try,said Saphira. I fear you have no choice now.
They wouldn’t dare harm us if I refused.
No, but they could cause us no end of grief. It is not for my own sake that I say accept, but for yours.
Many dangers exist that I cannot protect you from, Eragon. With Galbatorix set against us, you need
allies, not enemies, around you. We cannot afford to contend with both the Empire and the Varden.
Finally, “I’ll give it.” All around the table were signs of relaxation—even a poorly concealed sigh from
Umérth. They’re afraid of us!
As well they should be,sniped Saphira.
Jörmundur called for Jarsha, and with a few words sent the boy scam-pering off for Nasuada and Arya.
While he was gone, the conversation fell into an uncomfortable silence. Eragon ignored the council,
focusing instead on working a way out of his dilemma. None sprang to mind.
When the door opened again, everyone turned expectantly. First came Nasuada, chin held high and eyes
steady. Her embroidered gown was the deepest shade of black, deeper even than her skin, broken only
by a slash of royal purple that stretched from shoulder to hip. Behind her was Arya, her stride as lithe and
smooth as a cat’s, and an openly awestruck Jarsha.
The boy was dismissed, then Jörmundur helped Nasuada into a seat. Eragon hastened to do the same
for Arya, but she ignored the proffered chair and stood at a distance from the table. Saphira, he said, let
her know all that’s happened. I have a feeling the council won’t inform her that they’ve compelled
me to give the Varden my loyalty.
“Arya,” acknowledged Jörmundur with a nod, then concentrated on Nasuada. “Nasuada, Daughter of
Ajihad, the Council of Elders wishes to formally extend its deepest condolences for the loss you, more
than any-one else, have suffered....” In a lower voice, he added, “You have our per-sonal sympathies as
well. We all know what it is like to have a family member killed by the Empire.”
“Thank you,” murmured Nasuada, lowering her almond eyes. She sat, shy and demure, and with an air
of vulnerability that made Eragon want to comfort her. Her demeanor was tragically different from that of
the energetic young woman who had visited him and Saphira in the dragon-hold before the battle.
“Although this is your time of mourning, a quandary exists that you must resolve. This council cannot lead
the Varden. And someone must replace your father after the funeral. We ask that you receive the

Page 326

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

posi-tion. As his heir, it is rightfully yours—the Varden expect it of you.”
Nasuada bowed her head with shining eyes. Grief was plain in her voice when she said, “I never thought
I would be called upon to take my father’s place so young. Yet... if you insist it is my duty... I will
embrace the office.”
TRUTH AMONG FRIENDS

The Council of Elders beamed with triumph, pleased that Nasuada had done what they wanted. “We do
insist,” said Jörmundur, “for your own good and the good of the Varden.” The rest of the elders added
their ex-pressions of support, which Nasuada accepted with sad smiles. Sabrae threw an angry glance at
Eragon when he did not join in.
Throughout the exchange, Eragon watched Arya for any reaction to ei-ther his news or the council’s
announcement. Neither revelation caused her inscrutable expression to change. However, Saphira told
him, She wishes to talk with us afterward.
Before Eragon could reply, Falberd turned to Arya. “Will the elves find this agreeable?”
She stared at Falberd until the man fidgeted under her piercing gaze, then lifted an eyebrow. “I cannot
speak for my queen, but I find nothing objectionable to it. Nasuada has my blessing.”
How could she find it otherwise, knowing what we’ve told her?thought Eragon bitterly. We’re all
backed into corners.
Arya’s remark obviously pleased the council. Nasuada thanked her and asked Jörmundur, “Is there
anything else that must be discussed? For I am weary.”
Jörmundur shook his head. “We will make all the arrangements. I promise you won’t be troubled until
the funeral.”
“Again, thank you. Would you leave me now? I need time to consider how best to honor my father and
serve the Varden. You have given me much to ponder.” Nasuada splayed her delicate fingers on the
dark cloth on her lap.
Umérth looked like he was going to protest at the council being dis-missed, but Falberd waved a hand,
silencing him. “Of course, whatever will give you peace. If you need help, we are ready and willing to
serve.” Gesturing for the rest of them to follow, he swept past Arya to the door.
“Eragon, will you please stay?”
Startled, Eragon lowered himself back into his chair, ignoring alert looks from the councilors. Falberd
lingered by the door, suddenly reluctant to depart, then slowly went out. Arya was the last to go. Before
she closed the door, she looked at Eragon, her eyes revealing worry and apprehen-sion that had been
concealed before.
Nasuada sat partially turned away from Eragon and Saphira. “So we meet again, Rider. You haven’t
greeted me. Have I offended you?”

Page 327

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“No, Nasuada; I was reluctant to speak for fear of being rude or foolish. Current circumstances are
unkind to hasty statements.” Paranoia that they might be eavesdropped on gripped him. Reaching through
the bar-rier in his mind, he delved into the magic and intoned: “Atra nosu waíse vardo fra eld hórnya....
There, now we may speak without being over-heard by man, dwarf, or elf.”
Nasuada’s posture softened. “Thank you, Eragon. You don’t know what a gift that is.” Her words were
stronger and more self-assured than before.
Behind Eragon’s chair, Saphira stirred, then carefully made her way around the table to stand before
Nasuada. She lowered her great head un-til one sapphire eye met Nasuada’s black ones. The dragon
stared at her for a full minute before snorting softly and straightening. Tell her, said Saphira, that I grieve
for her and her loss. Also that her strength must be-come the Varden’s when she assumes Ajihad’s
mantle. They will need a sure guide.
Eragon repeated the words, adding, “Ajihad was a great man—his name will always be remembered....
There is something I must tell you. Before Ajihad died, he charged me, commanded me, to keep the
Varden from falling into chaos. Those were his last words. Arya heard them as well.
“I was going to keep what he said a secret because of the implications, but you have a right to know.
I’m not sure what Ajihad meant, nor ex-actly what he wanted, but I am certain of this: I will always
defend the Varden with my powers. I wanted you to understand that, and that I’ve no desire to usurp the
Varden’s leadership.”
Nasuada laughed brittlely. “But that leadership isn’t to be me, is it?” Her reserve had vanished, leaving
behind only composure and determination. “I know why you were here before me and what the council
is trying to do. Do you think that in the years I served my father, we never planned for this eventuality? I
expected the council to do exactly what it did. And now everything is in place for me to take command
of the Varden.”
“You have no intention of letting them rule you,” said Eragon with wonder.
“No. Continue to keep Ajihad’s instruction secret. It would be unwise to bandy it about, as people
might take it to mean that he wanted you to succeed him, and that would undermine my authority and
destabilize the Varden. He said what he thought he had to in order to protect the Varden. I would have
done the same. My father...” She faltered briefly. “My father’s work will not go unfinished, even if it
takes me to the grave. That is what I want you, as a Rider, to understand. All of Ajihad’s plans, all his
strategies and goals, they are mine now. I will not fail him by being weak. The Empire will be brought
down, Galbatorix will be dethroned, and the rightful government will be raised.”
By the time she finished, a tear ran down her cheek. Eragon stared, ap-preciating how difficult her
position was and recognizing a depth of char-acter he had not perceived before. “And what of me,
Nasuada? What shall I do in the Varden?”
She looked directly into his eyes. “You can do whatever you want. The council members are fools if
they think to control you. You are a hero to the Varden and the dwarves, and even the elves will hail
your victory over Durza when they hear of it. If you go against the council or me, we will be forced to
yield, for the people will support you wholeheartedly. Right now, you are the most powerful person in the
Varden. However, if you accept my leadership, I will continue the path laid down by Ajihad: you will go
with Arya to the elves, be instructed there, then return to the Varden.”
Why is she so honest with us?wondered Eragon. If she’s right, could we have refused the council’s

Page 328

demands?
Saphira took a moment to answer. Either way, it’s too late. You have al-ready agreed to their
requests. I think Nasuada is honest because your spell lets her be, and also because she hopes to
win our loyalty from the elders.
An idea suddenly came to Eragon, but before sharing it, he asked, Can we trust her to hold to what
she’s said? This is very important.
Yes,said Saphira. She spoke with her heart.
Then Eragon shared his proposal with Saphira. She consented, so he drew Zar’roc and walked to
Nasuada. He saw a flash of fear as he ap-proached; her gaze darted toward the door, and she slipped a
hand into a fold in her dress and grasped something. Eragon stopped before her, then knelt, Zar’roc flat
in his hands.
“Nasuada, Saphira and I have been here for only a short while. But in that time we came to respect
Ajihad, and now, in turn, you. You fought under Farthen Dûr when others fled, including the two women
of the council, and have treated us openly instead of with deception. Therefore, I offer you my blade...
and my fealty as a Rider.”
Eragon uttered the pronouncement with a sense of finality, knowing he would never have mouthed it
before the battle. Seeing so many men fall and die around him had altered his perspective. Resisting the
Empire was no longer something he did for himself, but for the Varden and all the people still trapped
under Galbatorix’s rule. However long it would take, he had dedicated himself to that task. For the time
being, the best thing he could do was serve.
Still, he and Saphira were taking a terrible risk in pledging themselves to Nasuada. The council could not
object because all Eragon had said was that he would swear fealty, but not to whom. Even so, he and
Saphira had no guarantee that Nasuada would make a good leader. It’s better to be sworn to an
honest fool than to a lying scholar, decided Eragon.
Surprise flitted across Nasuada’s face. She grasped Zar’roc’s hilt and lifted it—staring at its crimson
blade—then placed the tip on Eragon’s head. “I do accept your fealty with honor, Rider, as you accept
all the re-sponsibilities accompanying the station. Rise as my vassal and take your sword.”
Eragon did as he was bidden. He said, “Now I can tell you openly as my master, the council made me
agree to swear to the Varden once you were appointed. This was the only way Saphira and I could
circumvent them.”
Nasuada laughed with genuine delight. “Ah, I see you have already learned how to play our game. Very
well, as my newest and only vassal, will you agree to give your fealty to me again—in public, when the
coun-cil expects your vow?”
“Of course.”
“Good, that will take care of the council. Now, until then, leave me. I have much planning to do, and I
must prepare for the funeral.... Remem-ber, Eragon, the bond we have just created is equally binding; I
am as re-sponsible for your actions as you are required to serve me. Do not dis-honor me.”
“Nor you I.”

Page 329

Nasuada paused, then gazed into his eyes and added in a gentler tone: “You have my condolences,
Eragon. I realize that others beside myself have cause for sorrow; while I have lost my father, you have
also lost a friend. I liked Murtagh a great deal and it saddens me that he is gone.... Goodbye, Eragon.”
Eragon nodded, a bitter taste in his mouth, and left the room with Saphira. The hallway outside was
empty along its gray length. Eragon put his hands on his hips, tilted back his head, and exhaled. The day
had barely begun, yet he was already exhausted by all the emotions that had flooded through him.
Saphira nosed him and said, This way. Without further explanation, she headed down the right side of
the tunnel. Her polished claws clicked on the hard floor.
Eragon frowned, but followed her. Where are we going? No answer. Saphira, please. She just flicked
her tail. Resigned to wait, he said instead, Things have certainly changed for us. I never know what
to expect from one day to the next—except sorrow and bloodshed.
All is not bad,she reproached. We have won a great victory. It should be celebrated, not mourned.
It doesn’t help, having to deal with this other nonsense.
She snorted angrily. A thin line of fire shot from her nostrils, singeing Eragon’s shoulder. He jumped
back with a yelp, biting back a string of curses. Oops, said Saphira, shaking her head to clear the smoke.
Oops! You nearly roasted my side!
I didn’t expect it to happen. I keep forgetting that fire will come out if I’m not careful. Imagine that every
time you raised your arm, lightning struck the ground. It would be easy to make a careless motion and
destroy some-thing unintentionally.
You’re right.... Sorry I growled at you.
Her bony eyelid clicked as she winked at him. No matter. The point I was trying to make is that
even Nasuada can’t force you to do anything.
But I gave my word as a Rider!
Maybe so, but if I must break it to keep you safe, or to do the right thing, I will not hesitate. It is a
burden I could easily carry. Because I’m joined to you, my honor is inherent in your pledge, but as an
individual, I’m not bound by it. If I must, I will kidnap you. Any disobedience then would be no fault of
your own.
It should never come to that. If we have to use such tricks to do what’s right, then Nasuada and the
Varden will have lost all integrity.
Saphira stopped. They stood before the carved archway of Tronjheim’s library. The vast, silent room
seemed empty, though the ranks of back-to-back bookshelves interspersed with columns could conceal
many peo-ple. Lanterns poured soft light across the scroll-covered walls, illuminat-ing the reading
alcoves along their bases.
Weaving through the shelves, Saphira led him to one alcove, where Arya sat. Eragon paused as he
studied her. She seemed more agitated than he had ever seen her, though it manifested itself only in the

Page 330

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

tension of her movements. Unlike before, she wore her sword with the graceful cross-guard. One hand
rested on the hilt.
Eragon sat at the opposite side of the marble table. Saphira positioned herself between them, where
neither could escape her gaze.
“What have you done?” asked Arya with unexpected hostility.
“How so?”
She lifted her chin. “What have you promised the Varden? What have you done? ”
The last part even reached Eragon mentally. He realized just how close the elf was to losing control. A
bit of fear touched him. “We only did what we had to. I’m ignorant of elves’ customs, so if our actions
upset you, I apologize. There’s no cause to be angry.”
“Fool! You know nothing about me. I have spent seven decades repre-senting my queen here—fifteen
years of which I bore Saphira’s egg be-tween the Varden and the elves. In all that time, I struggled to
ensure the Varden had wise, strong leaders who could resist Galbatorix and respect our wishes. Brom
helped me by forging the agreement concerning the new Rider—you. Ajihad was committed to your
remaining independent so that the balance of power would not be upset. Now I see you siding with the
Council of Elders, willingly or not, to control Nasuada! You have overturned a lifetime of work! What
have you done? ”
Dismayed, Eragon dropped all pretenses. With short, clear words, he explained why he had agreed to
the council’s demands and how he and Saphira had attempted to undermine them.
When he finished, Arya stated, “So.”
“So.” Seventy years. Though he knew elves’ lives were extraordinarily long, he had never suspected
that Arya was that old, and older, for she appeared to be a woman in her early twenties. The only sign of
age on her unlined face was her emerald eyes—deep, knowing, and most often solemn.
Arya leaned back, studying him. “Your position is not what I would wish, but better than I had hoped. I
was impolite; Saphira... and you... understand more than I thought. Your compromise will be accepted
by the elves, though you must never forget your debt to us for Saphira. There would be no Riders
without our efforts.”
“The debt is burned into my blood and my palm,” said Eragon. In the si-lence that followed, he cast
about for a new topic, eager to prolong their conversation and perhaps learn more about her. “You have
been gone for such a long time; do you miss Ellesméra? Or did you live elsewhere?”
“Ellesméra was, and always shall be, my home,” she said, looking be-yond him. “I have not lived in my
family’s house since I left for the Varden, when the walls and windows were draped with spring’s first
flowers. The times I’ve returned were only fleeting stays, vanishing flecks of memory by our
measurement.”
He noticed, once again, that she smelled like crushed pine needles. It was a faint, spicy odor that opened
his senses and refreshed his mind. “It must be hard to live among all these dwarves and humans without
any of your kind.”

Page 331

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

She cocked her head. “You speak of humans as if you weren’t one.”
“Perhaps...,” he hesitated, “perhaps I am something else—a mixture of two races. Saphira lives inside
me as much as I live in her. We share feel-ings, senses, thoughts, even to the point where we are more
one mind than two.” Saphira dipped her head in agreement, nearly bumping the ta-ble with her snout.
“That is how it should be,” said Arya. “A pact more ancient and power-ful than you can imagine links
you. You won’t truly understand what it means to be a Rider until your training is completed. But that
must wait until after the funeral. In the meantime, may the stars watch over you.”
With that she departed, slipping into the library’s shadowed depths. Er-agon blinked. Is it me, or is
everyone on edge today? Like Arya—one mo-ment she’s angry, the next she’s giving me a
blessing!
No one will be comfortable until things return to normal.
Define normal.
RORAN

Roran trudged up the hill.
He stopped and squinted at the sun through his shaggy hair. Five hours till sunset. I won’t be able to
stay long. With a sigh, he continued along the row of elm trees, each of which stood in a pool of uncut
grass.
This was his first visit to the farm since he, Horst, and six other men from Carvahall had removed
everything worth salvaging from the de-stroyed house and burned barn. It had been nearly five months
before he could consider returning.
Once on the hilltop, Roran halted and crossed his arms. Before him lay the remains of his childhood
home. A corner of the house still stood— crumbling and charred—but the rest had been flattened and
was already covered with grass and weeds. Nothing could be seen of the barn. The few acres they had
managed to cultivate each year were now filled with dandelions, wild mustard, and more grass. Here and
there, stray beets or turnips had survived, but that was all. Just beyond the farm, a thick belt of trees
obscured the Anora River.
Roran clenched a fist, jaw muscles knotting painfully as he fought back a combination of rage and grief.
He stayed rooted to the spot for many long minutes, trembling whenever a pleasant memory rushed
through him. This place had been his entire life and more. It had been his past... and his future. His father,
Garrow, once said, “The land is a special thing. Care for it, and it’ll care for you. Not many things will do
that.” Roran had intended to do exactly that up until the moment his world was rup-tured by a quiet
message from Baldor.
With a groan, he spun away and stalked back toward the road. The shock of that moment still resonated
within him. Having everyone he loved torn away in an instant was a soul-changing event from which he
would never recover. It had seeped into every aspect of his behavior and outlook.
It also forced Roran to think more than ever before. It was as if bands had been cinched around his

Page 332

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

mind, and those bands had snapped, allow-ing him to ponder ideas that were previously unimaginable.
Such as the fact that he might not become a farmer, or that justice—the greatest standby in songs and
legends—had little hold in reality. At times these thoughts filled his consciousness to the point where he
could barely rise in the morning, feeling bloated with their heaviness.
Turning on the road, he headed north through Palancar Valley, back to Carvahall. The notched
mountains on either side were laden with snow, despite the spring greenery that had crept over the valley
floor in past weeks. Overhead, a single gray cloud drifted toward the peaks.
Roran ran a hand across his chin, feeling the stubble. Eragon caused all this—him and his blasted
curiosity—by bringing that stone out of the Spine. It had taken Roran weeks to reach that conclusion.
He had listened to everyone’s accounts. Several times he had Gertrude, the town healer, read aloud the
letter Brom had left him. And there was no other explana-tion. Whatever that stone was, it must have
attracted the strangers. For that alone, he blamed Garrow’s death on Eragon, though not in anger; he
knew that Eragon had intended no harm. No, what roused his fury was that Eragon had left Garrow
unburied and fled Palancar Valley, abandon-ing his responsibilities to gallop off with the old storyteller on
some hare-brained journey. How could Eragon have so little regard for those left be-hind? Did he
run because he felt guilty? Afraid? Did Brom mislead him with wild tales of adventure? And why
would Eragon listen to such things at a time like that?... I don’t even know if he’s dead or alive
right now.
Roran scowled and rolled his shoulders, trying to clear his mind. Brom’s letter... Bah! He had never
heard a more ridiculous collection of insinua-tions and ominous hints. The only thing it made clear was to
avoid the strangers, which was common sense to begin with. The old man was crazy, he decided.
A flicker of movement caused Roran to turn, and he saw twelve deer— including a young buck with
velvet horns—trotting back into the trees. He made sure to note their location so he could find them
tomorrow. He was proud that he could hunt well enough to support himself in Horst’s house, though he
had never been as skilled as Eragon.
As he walked, he continued to order his thoughts. After Garrow’s death, Roran had abandoned his job
at Dempton’s mill in Therinsford and returned to Carvahall. Horst had agreed to house him and, in the
follow-ing months, had provided him with work in the forge. Grief had delayed Roran’s decisions about
the future until two days ago, when he finally settled upon a course of action.
He wanted to marry Katrina, the butcher’s daughter. The reason he went to Therinsford in the first place
was to earn money to ensure a smooth beginning to their life together. But now, without a farm, a home,
or means to support her, Roran could not in good conscience ask for Katrina’s hand. His pride would
not allow it. Nor did Roran think Sloan, her father, would tolerate a suitor with such poor prospects.
Even under the best of circumstances, Roran had expected to have a hard time con-vincing Sloan to give
up Katrina; the two of them had never been friendly. And it was impossible for Roran to wed Katrina
without her fa-ther’s consent, not unless they wished to divide her family, anger the vil-lage by defying
tradition, and, most likely, start a blood feud with Sloan.
Considering the situation, it seemed to Roran that the only option available to him was to rebuild his
farm, even if he had to raise the house and barn himself. It would be hard, starting from nothing, but once
his position was secured, he could approach Sloan with his head held high. Next spring is the soonest
we might talk, thought Roran, grimacing.
He knew Katrina would wait—for a time, at least.

Page 333

He continued at a steady pace until evening, when the village came into view. Within the small huddle of
buildings, wash hung on lines strung from window to window. Men filed back toward the houses from
surrounding fields thick with winter wheat. Behind Carvahall, the half-mile-high Igualda Falls gleamed in
the sunset as it tumbled down the Spine into the Anora. The sight warmed Roran because it was so
ordi-nary. Nothing was more comforting than having everything where it should be.
Leaving the road, he made his way up the rise to where Horst’s house sat with a view of the Spine. The
door was already open. Roran tromped inside, following the sounds of conversation into the kitchen.
Horst was there, leaning on the rough table pushed into one corner of the room, his arms bare to the
elbow. Next to him was his wife, Elain, who was nearly five months pregnant and smiling with quiet
content-ment. Their sons, Albriech and Baldor, faced them.
As Roran entered, Albriech said, “... and I still hadn’t left the forge yet! Thane swears he saw me, but I
was on the other side of town.”
“What’s going on?” asked Roran, slipping off his pack.
Elain exchanged a glance with Horst. “Here, let me get you something to eat.” She set bread and a bowl
of cold stew before him. Then she looked him in the eye, as if searching for a particular expression.
“How was it?”
Roran shrugged. “All of the wood is either burnt or rotting—nothing worth using. The well is still intact,
and that’s something to be grateful for, I suppose. I’ll have to cut timber for the house as soon as
possible if I’m going to have a roof over my head by planting season. Now tell me, what’s happened?”
“Ha!” exclaimed Horst. “There’s been quite a row, there has. Thane is missing a scythe and he thinks
Albriech took it.”
“He probably dropped it in the grass and forgot where he left it,” snorted Albriech.
“Probably,” agreed Horst, smiling.
Roran bit into the bread. “It doesn’t make much sense, accusing you. If you needed a scythe, you could
just forge one.”
“I know,” said Albriech, dropping into a chair, “but instead of looking for his, he starts grousing that he
saw someone leaving his field and that it looked a bit like me... and since no one else looks like me, I
must have stolen the scythe.”
It was true that no one looked like him. Albriech had inherited both his father’s size and Elain’s
honey-blond hair, which made him an oddity in Carvahall, where brown was the predominant hair color.
In contrast, Baldor was both thinner and dark-haired.
“I’m sure it’ll turn up,” said Baldor quietly. “Try not to get too angry over it in the meantime.”
“Easy for you to say.”
As Roran finished the last of the bread and started on the stew, he asked Horst, “Do you need me for
anything tomorrow?”

Page 334

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“Not especially. I’ll just be working on Quimby’s wagon. The blasted frame still won’t sit square.”
Roran nodded, pleased. “Good. Then I’ll take the day and go hunting. There are a few deer farther
down the valley that don’t look too scrawny. Their ribs weren’t showing, at least.”
Baldor suddenly brightened. “Do you want some company?”
“Sure. We can leave at dawn.”
When he finished eating, Roran scrubbed his face and hands clean, then wandered outside to clear his
head. Stretching leisurely, he strolled to-ward the center of town.
Halfway there, the chatter of excited voices outside the Seven Sheaves caught his attention. He turned,
curious, and made his way to the tavern, where an odd sight met him. Sitting on the porch was a
middle-aged man draped in a patchwork leather coat. Beside him was a pack festooned with the steel
jaws of the trappers’ trade. Several dozen villagers listened as he gestured expansively and said, “So
when I arrived at Therinsford, I went to this man, Neil. Good, honest man; I help in his fields during the
spring and summer.”
Roran nodded. Trappers spent the winter squirreled away in the moun-tains, returning in the spring to
sell their skins to tanners like Gedric and then to take up work, usually as farmhands. Since Carvahall
was the northernmost village in the Spine, many trappers passed through it, which was one of the reasons
Carvahall had its own tavern, blacksmith, and tanner.
“After a few steins of ale—to lubricate my speaking, you understand, after a ’alf year with nary a word
uttered, except perhaps for blaspheming the world and all beyond when losing a bear-biter—I come to
Neil, the froth still fresh on my beard, and start exchanging gossip. As our transac-tion proceeds, I ask
him all gregarious-like, what news of the Empire or the king—may he rot with gangrene and trench
mouth. Was anyone born or died or banished that I should know of? And then guess what? Neil leaned
forward, going all serious ’bout the mouth, and said that word is going around, there is, from Dras-Leona
and Gil’ead of strange happen-ings here, there, and everywhere in Alagaësia. The Urgals have fair
disap-peared from civilized lands, and good riddance, but not one man can tell why or where. ’Alf the
trade in the Empire has dried up as a result of raids and attacks and, from what I heard, it isn’t the work
of mere brig-ands, for the attacks are too widespread, too calculated. No goods are sto-len, only burned
or soiled. But that’s not the end of it, oh no, not by the tip of your blessed grandmother’s whiskers.”
The trapper shook his head and took a sip from his wineskin before continuing: “There be mutterings of
a Shade haunting the northern territories. He’s been seen along the edge of Du Weldenvarden and near
Gil’ead. They say his teeth are filed to points, his eyes are as red as wine, and his hair is as red as the
blood he drinks. Worse, something seems to have gotten our fine, mad monarch’s dander up, so it has.
Five days past, a juggler from the south stopped in Therinsford on his lonesome way to Ceunon, and he
said that troops have been moving and gathering, though for what was beyond him.” He shrugged. “As
my pap taught me when I was a suckling babe, where there’s smoke, there’s fire. Perhaps it’s the
Varden. They’ve caused old Iron Bones enough pain in the arse over the years. Or perhaps Galbatorix
finally decided he’s had enough of tolerating Surda. At least he knows where to find it, unlike those
rebels. He’ll crush Surda like a bear crushes an ant, he will.”
Roran blinked as a babble of questions exploded around the trapper. He was inclined to doubt the
report of a Shade—it sounded too much like a story a drunk woodsman might invent—but the rest of it
all sounded bad enough to be true. Surda... Little information reached Car-vahall about that distant
country, but Roran at least knew that, although Surda and the Empire were ostensibly at peace, Surdans

Page 335

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

lived in constant fear that their more powerful neighbor to the north would invade them. For that reason,
it was said that Orrin, their king, supported the Varden.
If the trapper was right about Galbatorix, then it could mean ugly war crouched in the future,
accompanied by the hardships of increased taxes and forced conscription. I would rather live in an age
devoid of momentous events. Upheaval makes already difficult lives, such as ours, nigh
impossi-ble.
“What’s more, there have even been tales of...” Here the trapper paused and, with a knowing
expression, tapped the side of his nose with his fore-finger. “Tales of a new Rider in Alagaësia.” He
laughed then, a big, hearty laugh, slapping his belly as he rocked back on the porch.
Roran laughed as well. Stories of Riders appeared every few years. They had excited his interest the first
two or three times, but he soon learned not to trust such accounts, for they all came to naught. The
rumors were nothing more than wishful thinking on the part of those who longed for a brighter future.
He was about to head off when he noticed Katrina standing by the cor-ner of the tavern, garbed in a
long russet dress decorated with green rib-bon. She gazed at him with the same intensity with which he
gazed at her. Going over, he touched her on the shoulder and, together, they slipped away.
They walked to the edge of Carvahall, where they stood looking at the stars. The heavens were brilliant,
shimmering with thousands of celestial fires. And arching above them, from north to south, was the
glorious pearly band that streamed from horizon to horizon, like diamond dust tossed from a pitcher.
Without looking at him, Katrina rested her head on Roran’s shoulder and asked, “How was your day?”
“I returned home.” He felt her stiffen against him.
“What was it like?”
“Terrible.” His voice caught and he fell silent, holding her tightly. The scent of her copper hair on his
cheek was like an elixir of wine and spice and perfume. It seeped deep inside him, warm and comforting.
“The house, the barn, the fields, they’re all being overrun.... I wouldn’t have found them if I didn’t know
where to look.”
She finally turned to face him, stars flashing in her eyes, sorrow on her face. “Oh, Roran.” She kissed
him, lips brushing his for a brief moment. “You have endured so much loss, and yet your strength has
never failed you. Will you return to your farm now?”
“Aye. Farming is all I know.”
“And what shall become of me?”
He hesitated. From the moment he began to court her, an unspoken as-sumption that they would marry
had existed between them. There had been no need to discuss his intentions; they were as plain as the
day was long, and so her question unsettled him. It also felt improper to address the issue in such an open
manner when he was not ready to tender an of-fer. It was his place to make the overtures—first to Sloan
and then to Katrina—not hers. Still, he had to deal with her concern now that it had been expressed.
“Katrina... I cannot approach your father as I had planned. He would laugh at me, and rightly so. We
have to wait. Once I have a place for us to live and I’ve collected my first harvest, then he will listen to
me.”

Page 336

She faced the sky once more and whispered something so faint, he could not make it out. “What?”
“I said, are you afraid of him?”
“Of course not! I—”
“Then you must get his permission, tomorrow, and set the engagement. Make him understand that,
though you have nothing now, you will give me a good home and be a son-in-law he can be proud of.
There’s no rea-son we should waste our years living apart when we feel like this.”
“I can’t do that,” he said with a note of despair, willing her to under-stand. “I can’t provide for you, I
can’t—”
“Don’t you understand ?” She stepped away, her voice strained with ur-gency. “I love you, Roran, and
I want to be with you, but Father has other plans for me. There are far more eligible men than you, and
the longer you delay, the more he presses me to consent to a match of which he ap-proves. He fears I
will become an old maid, and I fear that too. I have only so much time or choice in Carvahall.... If I must
take another, I will.” Tears glistened in her eyes as she gave him a searching glance, waiting for his
response, then gathered up her dress and rushed back to the houses.
Roran stood there, motionless with shock. Her absence was as acute for him as losing the farm—the
world suddenly gone cold and unfriendly. It was as if part of himself had been torn away.
It was hours before he could return to Horst’s and slip into bed.
THE HUNTED HUNTERS

Dirt crunched under Roran’s boots as he led the way down the valley, which was cool and pale in the
early hours of the overcast morning. Bal-dor followed close behind, both of them carrying strung bows.
Neither spoke as they studied their surroundings for signs of the deer.
“There,” said Baldor in a low voice, pointing at a set of tracks leading toward a bramble on the edge of
the Anora.
Roran nodded and started after the spoor. It looked about a day old, so he risked speaking. “Could I
have your advice, Baldor? You seem to have a good understanding of people.”
“Of course. What is it?”
For a long time, the pad of their feet was the only noise. “Sloan wants to marry off Katrina, and not to
me. Every day that passes increases the chance he will arrange a union to his liking.”
“What does Katrina say of this?”
Roran shrugged. “He is her father. She cannot continue to defy his will when no one she does want has
stepped forward to claim her.”
“That is, you.”

Page 337

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“Aye.”
“And that’s why you were up so early.” It was no question.
In fact, Roran had been too worried to sleep at all. He had spent the entire night thinking about Katrina,
trying to find a solution to their pre-dicament. “I can’t bear to lose her. But I don’t think Sloan will give us
his blessing, what with my position and all.”
“No, I don’t think he would,” agreed Baldor. He glanced at Roran out of the corner of his eye. “What is
it you want my advice on, though?”
A snort of laughter escaped Roran. “How can I convince Sloan other-wise? How can I resolve this
dilemma without starting a blood feud?” He threw his hands up. “What should I do?”
“Have you no ideas?”
“I do, but not of a sort I find pleasing. It occurred to me that Katrina and I could simply announce we
were engaged—not that we are yet— and hang the consequences. That would force Sloan to accept our
be-trothal.”
A frown creased Baldor’s brow. He said carefully, “Maybe, but it would also create a slew of bad
feelings throughout Carvahall. Few would ap-prove of your actions. Nor would it be wise to force
Katrina to choose between you or her family; she might resent you for it in years to come.”
“I know, but what alternative do I have?”
“Before you take such a drastic step, I recommend you try to win Sloan over as an ally. There’s a
chance you might succeed, after all, if it’s made clear to him that no one else will want to marry an angry
Katrina. Espe-cially when you’re around to cuckold the husband.” Roran grimaced and kept his gaze on
the ground. Baldor laughed. “If you fail, well then, you can proceed with confidence, knowing that you
have indeed exhausted all other routes. And people will be less likely to spit upon you for break-ing
tradition and more likely to say Sloan’s bullheaded ways brought it upon himself.”
“Neither course is easy.”
“You knew that to begin with.” Baldor grew somber again. “No doubt there’ll be harsh words if you
challenge Sloan, but things will settle down in the end—perhaps not comfortably, but at least bearably.
Aside from Sloan, the only people you’ll really offend are prudes like Quimby, though how Quimby can
brew such a hale drink yet be so starched and bitter himself is beyond me.”
Roran nodded, understanding. Grudges could simmer for years in Car-vahall. “I’m glad we could talk.
It’s been...” He faltered, thinking of all the discussions he and Eragon used to share. They had been, as
Eragon once said, brothers in all but blood. It had been deeply comforting to know that someone existed
who would listen to him, no matter the time or circumstances. And to know that person would always
help him, no mat-ter the cost.
The absence of such a bond left Roran feeling empty.
Baldor did not press him to finish his sentence, but instead stopped to drink from his waterskin. Roran
continued for a few yards, then halted as a scent intruded on his thoughts.

It was the heavy odor of seared meat and charred pine boughs. Who would be here besides us?
Breathing deeply, he turned in a circle, trying to determine the source of the fire. A slight gust brushed
past him from far-ther down the road, carrying a hot, smoky wave. The aroma of food was intense
enough to make his mouth water.
He beckoned to Baldor, who hurried to his side. “Smell that?”
Baldor nodded. Together they returned to the road and followed it south. About a hundred feet away, it
bent around a copse of cotton-woods and curved out of view. As they approached the turn, the rise and
fall of voices reached them, muffled by the thick layer of morning fog over the valley.
At the copse’s fringe, Roran slowed to a stop. It was foolish to surprise people when they too might be
out hunting. Still, something bothered him. Perhaps it was the number of voices; the group seemed bigger
than any family in the valley. Without thinking, he stepped off the road and slipped behind the underbrush
lining the copse.
“What are you doing?” whispered Baldor.
Roran put a finger to his lips, then crept along, parallel to the road, keeping his footsteps as quiet as
possible. As they rounded the bend, he froze.
On the grass by the road was a camp of soldiers. Thirty helmets gleamed in a shaft of morning light as
their owners devoured fowl and stew cooked over several fires. The men were mud splattered and travel
stained, but Galbatorix’s symbol was still visible on their red tunics, a twisting flame outlined in gold
thread. Underneath the tunics, they wore leather brigandines—heavy with riveted squares of steel—mail
shirts, and then padded gambesons. Most of the soldiers bore broadswords, though half a dozen were
archers and another half-dozen carried wicked-looking halberds.
And hunched in their midst were two twisted black forms that Roran recognized from the numerous
descriptions the villagers provided upon his return from Therinsford: the strangers who had destroyed his
farm. His blood chilled. They’re servants of the Empire! He began to step for-ward, fingers already
reaching for an arrow, when Baldor grabbed his jer-kin and dragged him to the ground.
“Don’t. You’ll get us both killed.”
Roran glared at him, then snarled. “That’s... they’re the bastards...” He stopped, noticing that his hands
were shaking. “They’ve returned!”
“Roran,” whispered Baldor intently, “you can’t do anything. Look, they work for the king. Even if you
managed to escape, you’d be an outlaw everywhere, and you’d bring disaster on Carvahall.”
“What do they want? What can they want?” The king. Why did Galba-torix countenance my
father’s torture?
“If they didn’t get what they needed from Garrow, and Eragon fled with Brom, then they must want
you.” Baldor paused, letting the words sink in. “We have to get back and warn everyone. Then you have
to hide. The strangers are the only ones with horses. We can get there first if we run.”
Roran stared through the brush at the oblivious soldiers. His heart pounded fiercely for revenge,
clamoring to attack and fight, to see those two agents of misfortune pierced with arrows and brought to

their own justice. It mattered not that he would die as long as he could wash clean his pain and sorrow in
one fell moment. All he had to do was break cover. The rest would take care of itself.
Just one small step.
With a choked sob, he clenched his fist and dropped his head. I can’t leave Katrina . He remained
rigid—eyes squeezed shut—then with ago-nizing slowness dragged himself back. “Home then.”
Without waiting for Baldor’s reaction, Roran slipped through the trees as fast as he dared. Once the
camp was out of sight, he broke out onto the road and ran down the dirt track, channeling his frustration,
anger, and even fear into speed.
Baldor scrambled behind him, gaining on the open stretches. Roran slowed to a comfortable trot and
waited for him to draw level before saying, “You spread the word. I’ll talk with Horst.” Baldor nodded,
and they pushed on.
After two miles, they stopped to drink and rest briefly. When their panting subsided, they continued
through the low hills preceding Carva-hall. The rolling ground slowed them considerably, but even so, the
vil-lage soon burst into view.
Roran immediately broke for the forge, leaving Baldor to make his way to the center of town. As he
pounded past the houses, Roran wildly con-sidered schemes to evade or kill the strangers without
incurring the wrath of the Empire.
He burst into the forge to catch Horst tapping a peg into the side of Quimby’s wagon, singing:
... hey O!
And a ringing and a dinging
Rang from old iron! Wily old iron.
With a beat and a bang on the bones of the land,
I conquered wily old iron!
Horst stopped his mallet in midblow when he saw Roran. “What’s the matter, lad? Is Baldor hurt?”
Roran shook his head and leaned over, gasping for air. In short bursts, he reiterated all they had seen
and its possible implications, most impor-tantly that it was now clear the strangers were agents of the
Empire.
Horst fingered his beard. “You have to leave Carvahall. Fetch some food from the house, then take my
mare—Ivor’s pulling stumps with her—and ride into the foothills. Once we know what the soldiers want,
I’ll send Albriech or Baldor with word.”
“What will you say if they ask for me?”
“That you’re out hunting and we don’t know when you’ll return. It’s true enough, and I doubt they’ll
chance blundering around in the trees for fear of missing you. Assuming it’s you they’re really after.”

Page 340

Roran nodded, then turned and ran to Horst’s house. Inside, he grabbed the mare’s tack and bags from
the wall, quickly tied turnips, beets, jerky, and a loaf of bread in a knot of blankets, snatched up a tin pot,
and dashed out, pausing only long enough to explain the situation to Elain.
The supplies were an awkward bundle in his arms as he jogged east from Carvahall to Ivor’s farm. Ivor
himself stood behind the farmhouse, flicking the mare with a willow wand as she strained to tear the hairy
roots of an elm tree from the ground.
“Come on now!” shouted the farmer. “Put your back into it!” The horse shuddered with effort, her bit
lathered, then with a final surge tilted the stump on its side so the roots reached toward the sky like a
cluster of gnarled fingers. Ivor stopped her exertion with a twitch of the reins and patted her
good-naturedly. “All right.... There we go.”
Roran hailed him from a distance and, when they were close, pointed to the horse. “I need to borrow
her.” He gave his reasons.
Ivor swore and began unhitching the mare, grumbling, “Always the moment I get a bit of work done,
that’s when the interruption comes. Never before.” He crossed his arms and frowned as Roran cinched
the saddle, intent on his work.
When he was ready, Roran swung onto the horse, bow in hand. “I am sorry for the trouble, but it can’t
be helped.”
“Well, don’t worry about it. Just make sure you aren’t caught.”
“I’ll do that.”
As he set heels to the mare’s sides, Roran heard Ivor call, “And don’t be hiding up my creek!”
Roran grinned and shook his head, bending low over the horse’s neck. He soon reached the foothills of
the Spine and worked his way up to the mountains that formed the north end of Palancar Valley. From
there he climbed to a point on the mountainside where he could observe Carva-hall without being seen.
Then he picketed his steed and settled down to wait.
Roran shivered, eyeing the dark pines. He disliked being this close to the Spine. Hardly anyone from
Carvahall dared set foot in the mountain range, and those who did often failed to return.
Before long Roran saw the soldiers march up the road in a double line, two ominous black figures at
their head. They were stopped at the edge of Carvahall by a ragged group of men, some of them with
picks in hand. The two sides spoke, then simply faced each other, like growling dogs waiting to see who
would strike first. After a long moment, the men of Carvahall moved aside and let the intruders pass.
What happens now?wondered Roran, rocking back on his heels.
By evening the soldiers had set up camp in a field adjacent to the vil-lage. Their tents formed a low gray
block that flickered with weird shad-ows as sentries patrolled the perimeter. In the center of the block, a
large fire sent billows of smoke into the air.
Roran had made his own camp, and now he simply watched and thought. He always assumed that when
the strangers destroyed his home, they got what they wanted, which was the stone Eragon brought from
the Spine. They must not have found it, he decided. Perhaps Eragon man-aged to escape with the

Page 341

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

stone.... Perhaps he felt that he had to leave in order to protect it. He frowned. That would go a
long way toward explaining why Eragon fled, but it still seemed far-fetched to Roran. Whatever the
reason, that stone must be a fantastic treasure for the king to send so many men to retrieve it. I
can’t understand what would make it so valuable. Maybe it’s magic.
He breathed deeply of the cool air, listening to the hoot of an owl. A flicker of movement caught his
attention. Glancing down the mountain, he saw a man approaching in the forest below. Roran ducked
behind a boulder, bow drawn. He waited until he was sure it was Albriech, then whistled softly.
Albriech soon arrived at the boulder. On his back was an overfull pack, which he dropped to the ground
with a grunt. “I thought I’d never find you.”
“I’m surprised you did.”
“Can’t say I enjoyed wandering through the forest after sundown. I kept expecting to walk into a bear,
or worse. The Spine isn’t a fit place for men, if you ask me.”
Roran looked back out at Carvahall. “So why are they here?”
“To take you into custody. They’re willing to wait as long as they have to for you to return from
‘hunting.’ ”
Roran sat with a hard thump, his gut clenched with cold anticipation. “Did they give a reason? Did they
mention the stone?”
Albriech shook his head. “All they would say is that it’s the king’s busi-ness. The whole day they’ve
been asking questions about you and Er-agon—it’s all they’re interested in.” He hesitated. “I’d stay, but
they’ll no-tice if I am missing tomorrow. I brought plenty of food and blankets, plus some of Gertrude’s
salves in case you injure yourself. You should be fine up here.”
Summoning his energy, Roran smiled. “Thanks for the help.”
“Anyone would do it,” said Albriech with an embarrassed shrug. He started to leave, then tossed over
his shoulder, “By the way, the two strangers... they’re called the Ra’zac.”
SAPHIRA’S PROMISE

The morning after meeting with the Council of Elders, Eragon was cleaning and oiling Saphira’s
saddle—careful not to overexert himself— when Orik came to visit. The dwarf waited until Eragon
finished with a strap, then asked, “Are you better today?”
“A little.”
“Good, we all need our strength. I came partly to see to your health and also because Hrothgar wishes
to speak with you, if you are free.”
Eragon gave the dwarf a wry smile. “I’m always free for him. He must know that.”
Orik laughed. “Ah, but it’s polite to ask nicely.” As Eragon put down the saddle, Saphira uncoiled from

Page 342

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

her padded corner and greeted Orik with a friendly growl. “Morning to you as well,” he said with a bow.
Orik led them through one of Tronjheim’s four main corridors, toward its central chamber and the two
mirroring staircases that curved under-ground to the dwarf king’s throne room. Before they reached the
cham-ber, however, he turned down a small flight of stairs. It took Eragon a moment to realize that Orik
had taken a side passageway to avoid seeing the wreckage of Isidar Mithrim.
They came to a stop before the granite doors engraved with a seven-pointed crown. Seven armored
dwarves on each side of the entrance pounded the floor simultaneously with the hafts of their mattocks.
With the echoing thud of wood on stone, the doors swung inward.
Eragon nodded to Orik, then entered the dim room with Saphira. They advanced toward the distant
throne, passing the rigid statues, hírna, of past dwarf kings. At the foot of the heavy black throne, Eragon
bowed. The dwarf king inclined his silver-maned head in return, the rubies wrought into his golden helm
glowing dully in the light like flecks of hot iron. Volund, the war hammer, lay across his mail-sheathed
legs.
Hrothgar spoke: “Shadeslayer, welcome to my hall. You have done much since last we met. And, so it
seems, I have been proved wrong about Zar’roc. Morzan’s blade will be welcome in Tronjheim so long
as you bear it.”
“Thank you,” said Eragon, rising.
“Also,” rumbled the dwarf, “we wish you to keep the armor you wore in the battle of Farthen Dûr. Even
now our most skilled smiths are re-pairing it. The dragon armor is being treated likewise, and when it is
re-stored, Saphira may use it as long as she wishes, or until she outgrows it. This is the least we can do to
show our gratitude. If it weren’t for the war with Galbatorix, there would be feasts and celebrations in
your name... but those must wait until a more appropriate time.”
Voicing both his and Saphira’s sentiment, Eragon said, “You are gener-ous beyond all expectations. We
will cherish such noble gifts.”
Clearly pleased, Hrothgar nevertheless scowled, bringing his snarled eyebrows together. “We cannot
linger on pleasantries, though. I am be-sieged by the clans with demands that I do one thing or another
about Ajihad’s successor. When the Council of Elders proclaimed yesterday that they would support
Nasuada, it created an uproar the likes of which I haven’t seen since I ascended to the throne. The chiefs
had to decide whether to accept Nasuada or look for another candidate. Most have concluded that
Nasuada should lead the Varden, but I wish to know where you stand on this, Eragon, before I lend my
word to either side. The worst thing a king can do is look foolish.”
How much can we tell him?Eragon asked Saphira, thinking quickly.
He’s always treated us fairly, but we can’t know what he may have prom-ised other people. We’d best
be cautious until Nasuada actually takes power.
Very well.
“Saphira and I have agreed to help her. We won’t oppose her ascension. And”—Eragon wondered if
he was going too far—“I plead that you do the same; the Varden can’t afford to fight among themselves.
They need unity.”

Page 343

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“Oeí,” said Hrothgar, leaning back, “you speak with new authority. Your suggestion is a good one, but it
will cost a question: Do you think Nasuada will be a wise leader, or are there other motives in choosing
her?”
It’s a test,warned Saphira. He wants to know why we’ve backed her.
Eragon felt his lips twitch in a half-smile. “I think her wise and canny beyond her years. She will be good
for the Varden.”
“And that is why you support her?”
“Yes.”
Hrothgar nodded, dipping his long, snowy beard. “That relieves me. There has been too little concern
lately with what is right and good, and more about what will bring individual power. It is hard to watch
such idiocy and not be angry.”
An uncomfortable silence fell between them, stifling in the long throne room. To break it, Eragon asked,
“What will be done with the dragon-hold? Will a new floor be laid down?”
For the first time, the king’s eyes grew mournful, deepening the sur-rounding lines that splayed like
spokes on a wagon wheel. It was the closest Eragon had ever seen a dwarf come to weeping. “Much
talk is needed before that step can be taken. It was a terrible deed, what Saphira and Arya did. Maybe
necessary, but terrible. Ah, it might have been bet-ter if the Urgals had overrun us before Isidar Mithrim
was ever broken. The heart of Tronjheim has been shattered, and so has ours.” Hrothgar placed his fist
over his breast, then slowly unclenched his hand and reached down to grasp Volund’s leather-wrapped
handle.
Saphira touched Eragon’s mind. He sensed several emotions in her, but what surprised him the most
was her remorse and guilt. She truly regret-ted the Star Rose’s demise, despite the fact that it had been
required. Lit-tle one, she said, help me. I need to speak with Hrothgar. Ask him: Do the dwarves
have the ability to reconstruct Isidar Mithrim out of the shards?
As he repeated the words, Hrothgar muttered something in his own language, then said, “The skill we
have, but what of it? The task would take months or years, and the end result would be a ruined
mockery of the beauty that once graced Tronjheim! It is an abomination I will not sanction.”
Saphira continued to stare unblinkingly at the king. Now tell him: If Isi-dar Mithrim were put together
again, with not one piece missing, I believe I could make it whole once more.
Eragon gaped at her, forgetting Hrothgar in his astonishment. Saphira! The energy that would require!
You told me yourself that you can’t use magic at will, so what makes you sure you can do this?
I can do it if the need is great enough. It will be my gift to the dwarves. Remember Brom’s tomb; let that
wash your doubt away. And close your mouth—it’s unbecoming and the king is watching.
When Eragon conveyed Saphira’s offer, Hrothgar straightened with an exclamation. “Is it possible? Not
even the elves might attempt such a feat.”
“She is confident in her abilities.”

Page 344

“Then we will rebuild Isidar Mithrim, no matter if it takes a hundred years. We will assemble a frame for
the gem and set each piece into its original place. Not a single chip will be forgotten. Even if we must
break the larger pieces to move them, it will be done with all our skill in work-ing stone, so that no dust
or flecks are lost. You will come then, when we are finished, and heal the Star Rose.”
“We will come,” agreed Eragon, bowing.
Hrothgar smiled, and it was like the cracking of a granite wall. “Such joy you have given me, Saphira. I
feel once more a reason to rule and live. If you do this, dwarves everywhere will honor your name for
uncounted generations. Go now with my blessings while I spread the tidings among the clans. And do not
feel bound to wait upon my announcement, for no dwarf should be denied this news; convey it to all
whom you meet. May the halls echo with the jubilation of our race.”
With one more bow, Eragon and Saphira departed, leaving the dwarf king still smiling on his throne. Out
of the hall, Eragon told Orik what had transpired. The dwarf immediately bent and kissed the floor before
Saphira. He rose with a grin and clasped Eragon’s arm, saying, “A wonder indeed. You have given us
exactly the hope we needed to combat recent events. There will be drinking tonight, I wager!”
“And tomorrow is the funeral.”
Orik sobered for a moment. “Tomorrow, yes. But until then we shall not let unhappy thoughts disturb us!
Come!”
Taking Eragon’s hand, the dwarf pulled him through Tronjheim to a great feast hall where many dwarves
sat at stone tables. Orik leaped onto one, scattering dishes across the floor, and in a booming voice
proclaimed the news of Isidar Mithrim. Eragon was nearly deafened by the cheers and shouts that
followed. Each of the dwarves insisted on coming to Saphira and kissing the floor as Orik had. When
that was finished, they abandoned their food and filled their stone tankards with beer and mead.
Eragon joined the revelry with an abandon that surprised him. It helped to ease the melancholy gathered
in his heart. However, he did try to resist complete debauchery, for he was conscious of the duties that
awaited them the following day and he wanted to have a clear head.
Even Saphira took a sip of mead, and finding that she liked it, the dwarves rolled out a whole barrel for
her. Delicately lowering her mighty jaws through the cask’s open end, she drained it with three long
draughts, then tilted her head toward the ceiling and belched a giant tongue of flame. It took several
minutes for Eragon to convince the dwarves that it was safe to approach her again, but once he did, they
brought her another barrel—overriding the cook’s protests—and watched with amazement as she
emptied it as well.
As Saphira became increasingly inebriated, her emotions and thoughts washed through Eragon with
more and more force. It became difficult for him to rely upon the input of his own senses: her vision
began to slip over his own, blurring movement and changing colors. Even the odors he smelled shifted at
times, becoming sharper, more pungent.
The dwarves began to sing together. Weaving as she stood, Saphira hummed along, punctuating each
line with a roar. Eragon opened his mouth to join in and was shocked when, instead of words, out came
the snarling rasp of a dragon’s voice. That, he thought, shaking his head, is go-ing too far.... Or am I
just drunk? He decided it did not matter and pro-ceeded to sing boisterously, dragon’s voice or not.
Dwarves continued to stream into the hall as word of Isidar Mithrim spread. Hundreds soon packed the

Page 345

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

tables, with a thick ring around Eragon and Saphira. Orik called in musicians who arranged themselves in
a cor-ner, where they pulled slipcovers of green velvet off their instruments. Soon harps, lutes, and silver
flutes floated their gilded melodies over the throng.
Many hours passed before the noise and excitement began to calm. When it did, Orik once more
climbed onto the table. He stood there, legs spread wide for balance, tankard in hand, iron-bound cap
awry, and cried, “Hear, hear! At last we have celebrated as is proper. The Urgals are gone, the Shade is
dead, and we have won!” The dwarves all pounded their tables in approval. It was a good
speech—short and to the point. But Orik was not finished. “To Eragon and Saphira!” he roared, lifting
the tankard. This too was well received.
Eragon stood and bowed, which brought more cheers. Beside him, Saphira reared and swung a foreleg
across her chest, attempting to dupli-cate his move. She tottered, and the dwarves, realizing their danger,
scrambled away from her. They were barely in time. With a loud whoosh, Saphira fell backward, landing
flat on a banquet table.
Pain shot through Eragon’s back and he collapsed insensate by her tail.
REQUIEM

“Wake, Knurlhiem! You cannot sleep now. We are needed at the gate—they won’t start without us.”
Eragon forced his eyes open, conscious of an aching head and sore body. He was lying on a cold stone
table. “What?” He grimaced at the sick taste on his tongue.
Orik tugged on his brown beard. “Ajihad’s procession. We must be pre-sent for it!”
“No, what did you call me?” They were still in the banquet hall, but it was empty except for him, Orik,
and Saphira, who lay on her side be-tween two tables. She stirred and lifted her head, looking around
with bleary eyes.
“Stonehead! I called you Stonehead because I’ve been trying to wake you for almost an hour.”
Eragon pushed himself upright and slid off the table. Flashes of memory from the night before jumped
through his mind. Saphira, how are you? he asked, stumbling to her.
She swiveled her head, running her crimson tongue in and out over her teeth, like a cat that ate
something unpleasant. Whole... I think. My left wing feels a bit strange; I think it’s the one I landed
on. And my head is filled with a thousand hot arrows.
“Was anyone hurt when she fell?” asked Eragon, concerned.
A hearty chuckle exploded from the dwarf’s thick chest. “Only those who dropped off their seats from
laughing so hard. A dragon getting drunk and bowing at that! I’m sure lays will be sung about it for
decades.” Saphira shuffled her wings and looked away primly. “We thought it best to leave you here,
since we couldn’t move you, Saphira. It upset the head cook terribly—he feared you would drink more
of his best stock than the four barrels you already did.”
And you chastisedme once for drinking! If I consumed four barrels, it would kill me!

Page 346

That’s why you’re not a dragon.
Orik thrust a bundle of clothes into Eragon’s arms. “Here, put these on. They are more appropriate for a
funeral than your own attire. But hurry, we have little time.” Eragon struggled into the items—a billowy
white shirt with ties at the cuffs, a red vest decorated with gold braiding and embroidery, dark pants,
shiny black boots that clacked on the floor, and a swirling cape that fastened under his throat with a
studded brooch. In place of the usual plain leather band, Zar’roc was fastened to an ornate belt.
Eragon splashed his face with water and tried to arrange his hair neatly. Then Orik rushed him and
Saphira out of the hall and toward Tron-jheim’s south gate. “We must start from there,” he explained,
moving with surprising speed on his stocky legs, “because that is where the pro-cession with Ajihad’s
body stopped three days ago. His journey to the grave cannot be interrupted, or else his spirit will find no
rest.”
An odd custom,remarked Saphira.
Eragon agreed, noting a slight unsteadiness in her gait. In Carvahall, people were usually buried on their
farm, or if they lived in the village, in a small graveyard. The only rituals that accompanied the process
were lines recited from certain ballads and a death feast held afterward for rela-tives and friends. Can
you make it through the whole funeral? he asked as Saphira staggered again.
She grimaced briefly. That and Nasuada’s appointment, but then I’ll need to sleep. A pox on all
mead!
Returning to his conversation with Orik, Eragon asked, “Where will Ajihad be buried?”
Orik slowed and glanced at Eragon with caution. “That has been a mat-ter of contention among the
clans. When a dwarf dies, we believe he must be sealed in stone or else he will never join his ancestors....
It is complex and I cannot say more to an outsider... but we go to great lengths to assure such a burial.
Shame falls on a family or clan if they al-low any of their own to lie in a lesser element.
“Under Farthen Dûr exists a chamber that is the home of all knurlan, all dwarves, who have died here. It
is there Ajihad will be taken. He can-not be entombed with us, as he is human, but a hallowed alcove has
been set aside for him. There the Varden may visit him without disturbing our sacred grottos, and Ajihad
will receive the respect he is due.”
“Your king has done much for the Varden,” commented Eragon.
“Some think too much.”
Before the thick gate—drawn up on its hidden chains to reveal faint daylight drifting into Farthen
Dûr—they found a carefully arranged col-umn. Ajihad lay at the front, cold and pale on a white marble
bier borne by six men in black armor. Upon his head was a helm strewn with pre-cious stones. His hands
were clasped beneath his collarbone, over the ivory hilt of his bare sword, which extended from
underneath the shield covering his chest and legs. Silver mail, like circlets of moonbeams, weighed down
his limbs and fell onto the bier.
Close behind the body stood Nasuada—grave, sable-cloaked, and strong in stature, though tears
adorned her countenance. To the side was Hroth-gar in dark robes; then Arya; the Council of Elders, all
with suitably re-morseful expressions; and finally a stream of mourners that extended a mile from

Page 347

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Tronjheim.
Every door and archway of the four-story-high hall that led to the cen-tral chamber of Tronjheim, half a
mile away, was thrown open and crowded with humans and dwarves alike. Between the gray bands of
faces, the long tapestries swayed as they were brushed with hundreds of sighs and whispers when
Saphira and Eragon came into view.
Jörmundur beckoned for them to join him. Trying not to disturb the formation, Eragon and Saphira
picked through the column to the space by his side, earning a disapproving glare from Sabrae. Orik went
to stand behind Hrothgar.
Together they waited, though for what, Eragon knew not.
All the lanterns were shuttered halfway so that a cool twilight suffused the air, lending an ethereal feel to
the event. No one seemed to move or breathe: for a brief moment, Eragon fancied that they were all
statues frozen for eternity. A single plume of incense drifted from the bier, wind-ing toward the hazy
ceiling as it spread the scent of cedar and juniper. It was the only motion in the hall, a whiplash line
undulating sinuously from side to side.
Deep in Tronjheim, a drum gonged. Boom. The sonorous bass note resonated through their bones,
vibrating the city-mountain and causing it to echo like a great stone bell.
They stepped forward.
Boom.On the second note, another, lower drum melded with the first, each beat rolling inexorably
through the hall. The force of the sound propelled them along at a majestic pace. It gave each step
significance, a purpose and gravity suited to the occasion. No thought could exist in the throbbing that
surrounded them, only an upwelling of emotion that the drums expertly beguiled, summoning tears and
bittersweet joy at the same time.
Boom.
When the tunnel ended, Ajihad’s bearers paused between the onyx pil-lars before gliding into the central
chamber. There Eragon saw the dwarves grow even more solemn upon beholding Isidar Mithrim.
Boom.
They walked through a crystal graveyard. A circle of towering shards lay in the center of the great
chamber, surrounding the inlaid hammer and pentacles. Many pieces were larger than Saphira. The rays
of the star sapphire still shimmered in the fragments, and on some, petals of the carved rose were visible.
Boom.
The bearers continued forward, between the countless razor edges. Then the procession turned and
descended broad flights of stairs to the tunnels below. Through many caverns they marched, passing
stone huts where dwarven children clutched their mothers and stared with wide eyes.
Boom.
And with that final crescendo, they halted under ribbed stalactites that branched over a great catacomb
lined with alcoves. In each alcove lay a tomb carved with a name and clan crest. Thousands—hundreds

of thou-sands—were buried here. The only light came from sparsely placed red lanterns, pale in the
shadows.
After a moment, the bearers strode to a small room annexed to the main chamber. In the center, on a
raised platform, was a great crypt open to waiting darkness. On the top was carved in runes:
May all, Knurlan, Humans, and Elves,
Remember
This Man.
For he was Noble, Strong, and Wise.
Gûntera Arûna
When the mourners were gathered around, Ajihad was lowered into the crypt, and those who had
known him personally were allowed to ap-proach. Eragon and Saphira were fifth in line, behind Arya. As
they as-cended the marble steps to view the body, Eragon was gripped by an overwhelming sense of
sorrow, his anguish compounded by the fact that he considered this as much Murtagh’s funeral as
Ajihad’s.
Stopping alongside the tomb, Eragon gazed down at Ajihad. He ap-peared far more calm and tranquil
than he ever did in life, as if death had recognized his greatness and honored him by removing all traces of
his worldly cares. Eragon had known Ajihad only a short while, but in that time he had come to respect
him both as a person and for what he repre-sented: freedom from tyranny. Also, Ajihad was the first
person to grant safe haven to Eragon and Saphira since they left Palancar Valley.
Stricken, Eragon tried to think of the greatest praise he could give. In the end, he whispered past the
lump in his throat, “You will be remem-bered, Ajihad. I swear it. Rest easy knowing that Nasuada shall
continue your work and the Empire will be overthrown because of what you ac-complished.” Conscious
of Saphira’s touch on his arm, Eragon stepped off the platform with her and allowed Jörmundur to take
his place.
When at last everyone had paid their respects, Nasuada bowed over Ajihad and touched her father’s
hand, holding it with gentle urgency. Ut-tering a pained groan, she began to sing in a strange, wailing
language, filling the cavern with her lamentations.
Then came twelve dwarves, who slid a marble slab over Ajihad’s up-turned face. And he was no more.
FEALTY

Eragon yawned and covered his mouth as people filed into the under-ground amphitheater. The spacious
arena echoed with a babble of voices discussing the funeral that had just concluded.
Eragon sat on the lowest tier, level with the podium. With him were Orik, Arya, Hrothgar, Nasuada, and
the Council of Elders. Saphira stood on the row of stairs that cut upward through the tiers. Leaning over,
Orik said, “Ever since Korgan, each of our kings has been chosen here. It’s fitting that the Varden should
do likewise.”

It’s yet to be seen,thought Eragon, if this transfer of power will remain peaceful. He rubbed an eye,
brushing away fresh tears; the funeral ceremony had left him shaken.
Lathered over the remnants of his grief, anxiety now twisted his gut. He worried about his own role in
the upcoming events. Even if all went well, he and Saphira were about to make potent enemies. His hand
dropped to Zar’roc and tightened on the pommel.
It took several minutes for the amphitheater to fill. Then Jörmundur stepped up to the podium. “People
of the Varden, we last stood here fif-teen years ago, at Deynor’s death. His successor, Ajihad, did more
to op-pose the Empire and Galbatorix than any before. He won countless bat-tles against superior
forces. He nearly killed Durza, putting a scratch on the Shade’s blade. And greatest of all, he welcomed
Rider Eragon and Saphira into Tronjheim. However, a new leader must be chosen, one who will win us
even more glory.”
Someone high above shouted, “Shadeslayer!”
Eragon tried not to react—he was pleased to see that Jörmundur did not even blink. He said, “Perhaps
in years to come, but he has other du-ties and responsibilities now. No, the Council of Elders has thought
long on this: we need one who understands our needs and wants, one who has lived and suffered
alongside us. One who refused to flee, even when bat-tle was imminent.”
At that moment, Eragon sensed comprehension rush through the lis-teners. The name came as a whisper
from a thousand throats and was ut-tered by Jörmundur himself: “Nasuada.” With a bow, Jörmundur
stepped aside.
Next was Arya. She surveyed the waiting audience, then said, “The elves honor Ajihad tonight.... And
on behalf of Queen Islanzadí, I recog-nize Nasuada’s ascension and offer her the same support and
friendship we extended to her father. May the stars watch over her.”
Hrothgar took the podium and stated gruffly, “I too support Nasuada, as do the clans.” He moved
aside.
Then it was Eragon’s turn. Standing before the crowd, with all eyes upon him and Saphira, he said, “We
support Nasuada as well.” Saphira growled in affirmation.
Pledges spoken, the Council of Elders lined themselves on either side of the podium, Jörmundur at their
head. Bearing herself proudly, Nasuada approached and knelt before him, her dress splayed in raven
billows. Raising his voice, Jörmundur said, “By the right of inheritance and succes-sion, we have chosen
Nasuada. By merit of her father’s achievements and the blessings of her peers, we have chosen
Nasuada. I now ask you: Have we chosen well?”
The roar was overwhelming. “Yes!”
Jörmundur nodded. “Then by the power granted to this council, we pass the privileges and
responsibilities accorded to Ajihad to his only de-scendant, Nasuada.” He gently placed a circlet of silver
on Nasuada’s brow. Taking her hand, he lifted her upright and pronounced, “I give you our new leader!”
For ten minutes, the Varden and dwarves cheered, thundering their approbation until the hall rang with
the clamor. Once their cries sub-sided, Sabrae motioned to Eragon, whispering, “Now is the time to fulfill
your promise.”

At that moment, all noise seemed to cease for Eragon. His nervousness disappeared too, swallowed in
the tide of the moment. Steeling himself with a breath, he and Saphira started toward Jörmundur and
Nasuada, each step an eternity. As they walked, he stared at Sabrae, Elessari, Umérth, and
Falberd—noting their half-smiles, smugness, and on Sabrae’s part, outright disdain. Behind the council
members stood Arya. She nod-ded in support.
We are about to change history,said Saphira.
We’re throwing ourselves off a cliff without knowing how deep the water below is.
Ah, but what a glorious flight!
With a brief look at Nasuada’s serene face, Eragon bowed and kneeled. Slipping Zar’roc from its
sheath, he placed the sword flat on his palms, then lifted it, as if to proffer it to Jörmundur. For a moment,
the sword hovered between Jörmundur and Nasuada, teetering on the wire edge of two different
destinies. Eragon felt his breath catch—such a simple choice to balance a life on. And more than a life—a
dragon, a king, an Empire!
Then his breath rushed in, filling his lungs with time once again, and he swung to face Nasuada. “Out of
deep respect... and appreciation of the difficulties facing you... I, Eragon, first Rider of the Varden,
Shadeslayer and Argetlam, give you my blade and my fealty, Nasuada.”
The Varden and dwarves stared, dumbstruck. In that same instant, the Council of Elders flashed from
triumphant gloating to enraged impo-tence. Their glares burned with the strength and venom of those
be-trayed. Even Elessari let outrage burst through her pleasant demeanor. Only Jörmundur—after a brief
jolt of surprise—seemed to accept the announcement with equanimity.
Nasuada smiled and grasped Zar’roc, placing the sword’s tip on Eragon’s forehead, just as before. “I
am honored that you choose to serve me, Rider Eragon. I accept, as you accept all the responsibilities
accompany-ing the station. Rise as my vassal and take your sword.”
Eragon did so, then stepped back with Saphira. With shouts of ap-proval, the crowd rose to their feet,
the dwarves stamping in rhythm with their hobnail boots while human warriors banged swords across
shields.
Turning to the podium, Nasuada gripped it on either side and looked up at all the people in the
amphitheater. She beamed at them, pure joy shining from her face. “People of the Varden!”
Silence.
“As my father did before me, I give my life to you and our cause. I will never cease fighting until the
Urgals are vanquished, Galbatorix is dead, and Alagaësia is free once more!”
More cheering and applause.
“Therefore, I say to you, now is the time to prepare. Here in Farthen Dûr—after endless
skirmishes—we won our greatest battle. It is our turn to strike back. Galbatorix is weak after losing so
many forces, and there will never again be such an opportunity.
“Therefore, I say again, now is the time to prepare so that we may once more stand victorious!”

Page 351

After more speeches by various personages—including a still-glowering Falberd—the amphitheater
began to empty. As Eragon stood to leave, Orik grasped his arm, stopping him. The dwarf was
wide-eyed. “Eragon, did you plan all that beforehand?”
Eragon briefly considered the wisdom of telling him, then nodded. “Yes.”
Orik exhaled, shaking his head. “That was a bold stroke, it was. You’ve given Nasuada a strong
position to begin with. It was dangerous, though, if the reactions of the Council of Elders are anything to
judge by. Did Arya approve of this?”
“She agreed it was necessary.”
The dwarf studied him thoughtfully. “I’m sure it was. You just altered the balance of power, Eragon. No
one will underestimate you again be-cause of it.... Beware the rotten stone. You have earned some
powerful enemies today.” He slapped Eragon on the side and continued past.
Saphira watched him go, then said, We should prepare to leave Farthen Dûr. The council will be
thirsty for revenge. The sooner we’re out of their reach, the better.
A SORCERESS, A SNAKE, AND A SCROLL

That evening, as Eragon returned to his quarters from bathing, he was surprised to find a tall woman
waiting for him in the hall. She had dark hair, startling blue eyes, and a wry mouth. Wound around her
wrist was a gold bracelet shaped like a hissing snake. Eragon hoped that she wasn’t there to ask him for
advice, like so many of the Varden.
“Argetlam.” She curtsied gracefully.
He inclined his head in return. “Can I help you?”
“I hope so. I’m Trianna, sorceress of Du Vrangr Gata.”
“Really? A sorceress?” he asked, intrigued.
“And battle mage and spy and anything else the Varden deem neces-sary. There aren’t enough magic
users, so we each end up with a half-dozen tasks.” She smiled, displaying even, white teeth. “That’s why
I came today. We would be honored to have you take charge of our group. You’re the only one who
can replace the Twins.”
Almost without realizing it, he smiled back. She was so friendly and charming, he hated to say no. “I’m
afraid I can’t; Saphira and I are leaving Tronjheim soon. Besides, I’d have to consult with Nasuada first
anyway.”
And I don’t want to be entangled in any more politics... especially not where the Twins used to lead.
Trianna bit her lip. “I’m sorry to hear that.” She moved a step closer. “Perhaps we can spend some time
together before you have to go. I could show you how to summon and control spirits.... It would be
educational for both of us.”

Page 352

Eragon felt a hot flush warm his face. “I appreciate the offer, but I’m really too busy at the moment.”
A spark of anger flared within Trianna’s eyes, then vanished so quickly, he wondered whether he had
seen it at all. She sighed delicately. “I un-derstand.”
She sounded so disappointed—and looked so forlorn—Eragon felt guilty for rebuffing her. It can’t hurt
to talk with her for a few minutes, he told himself. “I’m curious; how did you learn magic?”
Trianna brightened. “My mother was a healer in Surda. She had a bit of power and was able to instruct
me in the old ways. Of course, I’m no-where near as powerful as a Rider. None of Du Vrangr Gata
could have defeated Durza alone, like you did. That was a heroic deed.”
Embarrassed, Eragon scuffed his boots against the ground. “I wouldn’t have survived if not for Arya.”
“You are too modest, Argetlam,” she admonished. “It was you who struck the final blow. You should
be proud of your accomplishment. It’s a feat worthy of Vrael himself.” She leaned toward him. His heart
quick-ened as he smelled her perfume, which was rich and musky, with a hint of an exotic spice. “Have
you heard the songs composed about you? The Varden sing them every night around their fires. They say
you’ve come to take the throne from Galbatorix!”
“No,” said Eragon, quick and sharp. That was one rumor he would not tolerate. “They might, but I
don’t. Whatever my fate may be, I don’t as-pire to rule.”
“And it’s wise of you not to. What is a king, after all, but a man impris-oned by his duties? That would
be a poor reward indeed for the last free Rider and his dragon. No, for you the ability to go and do what
you will and, by extension, to shape the future of Alagaësia.” She paused. “Do you have any family left in
the Empire?”
What?“ Only a cousin.”
“Then you’re not betrothed?”
The question caught him off guard. He had never been asked that be-fore. “No, I’m not betrothed.”
“Surely there must be someone you care about.” She came another step closer, and her ribboned sleeve
brushed his arm.
“I wasn’t close to anyone in Carvahall,” he faltered, “and I’ve been trav-eling since then.”
Trianna drew back slightly, then lifted her wrist so the serpent bracelet was at eye level. “Do you like
him?” she inquired. Eragon blinked and nodded, though it was actually rather disconcerting. “I call him
Lorga. He’s my familiar and protector.” Bending forward, she blew upon the bracelet, then murmured,
“Sé orúm thornessa hávr sharjalví lífs.”
With a dry rustle, the snake stirred to life. Eragon watched, fascinated, as the creature writhed around
Trianna’s pale arm, then lifted itself and fixed its whirling ruby eyes upon him, wire tongue whipping in
and out. Its eyes seemed to expand until they were each as large as Eragon’s fist. He felt as if he were
tumbling into their fiery depths; he could not look away no matter how hard he tried.
Then at a short command, the serpent stiffened and resumed its former position. With a tired sigh,

Page 353

Trianna leaned against the wall. “Not many people understand what we magic users do. But I wanted
you to know that there are others like you, and we will help if we can.”
Impulsively, Eragon put his hand on hers. He had never attempted to approach a woman this way
before, but instinct urged him onward, dar-ing him to take the chance. It was frightening, exhilarating. “If
you want, we could go and eat. There’s a kitchen not far from here.”
She slipped her other hand over his, fingers smooth and cool, so differ-ent from the rough grips he was
accustomed to. “I’d like that. Shall we—” Trianna stumbled forward as the door burst open behind her.
The sor-ceress whirled around, only to yelp as she found herself face to face with Saphira.
Saphira remained motionless, except for one lip that slowly lifted to reveal a line of jagged teeth. Then
she growled. It was a marvelous growl—richly layered with scorn and menace—that rose and fell
through the hall for more than a minute. Listening to it was like enduring a blis-tering, hackle-raising
tirade.
Eragon glared at her the whole time.
When it was over, Trianna was clenching her dress with both fists, twisting the fabric. Her face was
white and scared. She quickly curtsied to Saphira, then, with a barely controlled motion, turned and fled.
Acting as if nothing had happened, Saphira lifted a leg and licked a claw. It was nearly impossible to
get the door open, she sniffed.
Eragon could not contain himself any longer. Why did you do that? he exploded. You had no reason
to interfere!
You needed my help,she continued, unperturbed.
If I’d needed your help, I would have called!
Don’t yell at me, she snapped, letting her jaws click together. He could sense her emotions boiling with
as much turmoil as his. I’ll not have you run around with a slattern who cares more for Eragon as
Rider than you as a person.
She wasn’t a slattern,roared Eragon. He pounded the wall in frustra-tion. I’m a man now, Saphira, not
a hermit. You can’t expect me to ignore... ignore women just because of who I am. And it’s
certainly not your decision to make. At the very least, I might have enjoyed a conversation with
her, anything other than the tragedies we’ve dealt with lately. You’re in my head enough to know
how I feel. Why couldn’t you leave me alone? Where was the harm?
You don’t understand.She refused to meet his eyes.
Don’t understand! Will you prevent me from ever having a wife and chil-dren? What of a family?
Eragon.She finally fixed one great eye on him. We are intimately linked.
Obviously!
And if you pursue a relationship, with or without my blessing, and be-come... attached... to someone,
my feelings will become engaged as well. You should know that. Therefore—and I warn you only
once—be careful who you choose, because it will involve both of us.

Page 354

He briefly considered her words. Our bond works both ways, however. If you hate someone, I will
be influenced likewise.... I understand your con-cern. So you weren’t just jealous?
She licked the claw once more. Perhaps a little.
Eragon was the one who growled this time. He brushed past her into the room, grabbed Zar’roc, then
stalked away, belting on the sword.
He wandered through Tronjheim for hours, avoiding contact with eve-ryone. What had occurred pained
him, though he could not deny the truth of Saphira’s words. Of all the matters they shared, this was the
most delicate and the one they agreed upon least. That night—for the first time since he was captured at
Gil’ead—he slept away from Saphira, in one of the dwarves’ barracks.
Eragon returned to their quarters the following morning. By unspoken consent, he and Saphira avoided
discussing what had transpired; further argument was pointless when neither party was willing to yield
ground. Besides, they were both so relieved to be reunited, they did not want to risk endangering their
friendship again.
They were eating lunch—Saphira tearing at a bloody haunch—when Jarsha trotted up. Like before, he
stared wide-eyed at Saphira, following her movements as she nibbled off the end of a leg bone. “Yes?”
asked Er-agon, wiping his chin and wondering if the Council of Elders had sent for them. He had heard
nothing from them since the funeral.
Jarsha turned away from Saphira long enough to say, “Nasuada would like to see you, sir. She’s waiting
in her father’s study.”
Sir!Eragon almost laughed. Only a little while ago, he would have been calling people sir, not the other
way around. He glanced at Saphira. “Are you done, or should we wait a few minutes?”
Rolling her eyes, she fit the rest of the meat into her mouth and split the bone with a loud crack. I’m
done.
“All right,” said Eragon, standing, “you can go, Jarsha. We know the way.”
It took almost half an hour to reach the study because of the city-mountain’s size. As during Ajihad’s
rule, the door was guarded, but in-stead of two men, an entire squad of battle-hardened warriors now
stood before it, alert for the slightest hint of danger. They would clearly sacri-fice themselves to protect
their new leader from ambush or attack. Though the men could not have failed to recognize Eragon and
Saphira, they barred the way while Nasuada was alerted of her visitors. Only then were the two allowed
to enter.
Eragon immediately noticed a change: a vase of flowers in the study. The small purple blossoms were
unobtrusive, but they suffused the air with a warm fragrance that—for Eragon—evoked summers of
fresh-picked raspberries and scythed fields turning bronze under the sun. He inhaled, appreciating the
skill with which Nasuada had asserted her indi-viduality without obliterating Ajihad’s memory.
She sat behind the broad desk, still cloaked in the black of mourning.
As Eragon seated himself, Saphira beside him, she said, “Eragon.” It was a simple statement, neither
friendly nor hostile. She turned away briefly, then focused on him, her gaze steely and intent. “I have

Page 355

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

spent the last few days reviewing the Varden’s affairs, such as they are. It was a dismal exer-cise. We
are poor, overextended, and low on supplies, and few recruits are joining us from the Empire. I mean to
change that.
“The dwarves cannot support us much longer, as it’s been a lean year for farming and they’ve suffered
losses of their own. Considering this, I have decided to move the Varden to Surda. It’s a difficult
proposition, but one I believe necessary to keep us safe. Once in Surda, we will finally be close enough
to engage the Empire directly.”
Even Saphira stirred with surprise. The work that would involve! said Er-agon. It could take months
to get everyone’s belongings to Surda, not to men-tion all the people. And they’d probably be
attacked along the way. “I thought King Orrin didn’t dare openly oppose Galbatorix,” he protested.
Nasuada smiled grimly. “His stance has changed since we defeated the Urgals. He will shelter and feed
us and fight by our side. Many Varden are already in Surda, mainly women and children who couldn’t or
wouldn’t fight. They will also support us, else I will strip our name from them.”
“How,” asked Eragon, “did you communicate with King Orrin so quickly?”
“The dwarves use a system of mirrors and lanterns to relay messages through their tunnels. They can
send a dispatch from here to the western edge of the Beor Mountains in less than a day. Couriers then
transport it to Aberon, capital of Surda. Fast as it is, that method is still too slow when Galbatorix can
surprise us with an Urgal army and give us less than a day’s notice. I intend to arrange something far
more expedient between Du Vrangr Gata and Hrothgar’s magicians before we go.”
Opening the desk drawer, Nasuada removed a thick scroll. “The Varden will depart Farthen Dûr within
the month. Hrothgar has agreed to provide us with safe passage through the tunnels. Moreover, he sent a
force to Orthíad to remove the last vestiges of Urgals and seal the tunnels so no one can invade the
dwarves by that route again. As this may not be enough to guarantee the Varden’s survival, I have a
favor to ask of you.”
Eragon nodded. He had expected a request or order. That was the only reason for her to have
summoned them. “I am yours to command.”
“Perhaps.” Her eyes flicked to Saphira for a second. “In any case, this is not a command, and I want
you to think carefully before replying. To help rally support for the Varden, I wish to spread word
throughout the Empire that a new Rider—named Eragon Shadeslayer—and his dragon, Saphira, have
joined our cause. I would like your permission before doing so, however.”
It’s too dangerous,objected Saphira.
Word of our presence here will reach the Empire anyway,pointed out Er-agon. The Varden will want
to brag about their victory and Durza’s death. Since it’ll happen with or without our approval, we
should agree to help.
She snorted softly. I’m worried about Galbatorix. Until now we haven’t made it public where our
sympathies lie.
Our actions have been clear enough.
Yes, but even when Durza fought you in Tronjheim, he wasn’t trying to kill you. If we become

Page 356

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

outspoken in our opposition to the Empire, Galbatorix won’t be so lenient again. Who knows what
forces or plots he may have kept in abeyance while he tried to gain hold of us? As long as we remain
am-biguous, he won’t know what to do.
The time for ambiguity has passed,asserted Eragon. We fought the Ur-gals, killed Durza, and I have
sworn fealty to the leader of the Varden. No ambiguity exists. No, with your permission, I will
agree to her proposal.
She was silent for a long while, then dipped her head. As you wish.
He put a hand on her side before returning his attention to Nasuada and saying, “Do what you see fit. If
this is how we can best assist the Varden, so be it.”
“Thank you. I know it is a lot to ask. Now, as we discussed before the funeral, I expect you to travel to
Ellesméra and complete your training.”
“With Arya?”
“Of course. The elves have refused contact with both humans and dwarves ever since she was captured.
Arya is the only being who can convince them to emerge from seclusion.”
“Couldn’t she use magic to tell them of her rescue?”
“Unfortunately not. When the elves retreated into Du Weldenvarden after the fall of the Riders, they
placed wards around the forest that pre-vent any thought, item, or being from entering it through arcane
means, though not from exiting it, if I understood Arya’s explanation. Thus, Arya must physically visit Du
Weldenvarden before Queen Islanzadí will know that she is alive, that you and Saphira exist, and of the
numerous events that have befallen the Varden these past months.” Nasuada handed him the scroll. It
was stamped with a wax sigil. “This is a missive for Queen Islanzadí, telling her about the Varden’s
situation and my own plans. Guard it with your life; it would cause a great deal of harm in the wrong
hands. I hope that after all that’s happened, Islanzadí will feel kindly enough toward us to reinitiate
diplomatic ties. Her assistance could mean the difference between victory and defeat. Arya knows this
and has agreed to press our case, but I wanted you aware of the situation too, so you could take
advantage of any opportunities that might arise.”
Eragon tucked the scroll into his jerkin. “When will we leave?”
“Tomorrow morning... unless you have something already planned?”
“No.”
“Good.” She clasped her hands. “You should know, one other person will be traveling with you.” He
looked at her quizzically. “King Hrothgar insisted that in the interest of fairness there should be a dwarf
representa-tive present at your training, since it affects their race as well. So he’s sending Orik along.”
Eragon’s first reaction was irritation. Saphira could have flown Arya and him to Du Weldenvarden,
thereby eliminating weeks of unnecessary travel. Three passengers, however, were too many to fit on
Saphira’s shoulders. Orik’s presence would confine them to the ground.
Upon further reflection, Eragon acknowledged the wisdom of Hroth-gar’s request. It was important for
Eragon and Saphira to maintain a sem-blance of equality in their dealings with the different races. He

Page 357

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

smiled. “Ah, well, it’ll slow us down, but I suppose we have to placate Hrothgar. To tell the truth, I’m
glad Orik is coming. Crossing Alagaësia with only Arya was a rather daunting prospect. She’s...”
Nasuada smiled too. “She’s different.”
“Aye.” He grew serious again. “Do you really mean to attack the Em-pire? You said yourself that the
Varden are weak. It doesn’t seem like the wisest course. If we wait—”
“If we wait,” she said sternly, “Galbatorix will only get stronger. This is the first time since Morzan was
slain that we have even the slightest op-portunity of catching him unprepared. He had no reason to
suspect we could defeat the Urgals—which we did thanks to you—so he won’t have readied the Empire
for invasion.”
Invasion!exclaimed Saphira. And how does she plan to kill Galbatorix when he flies out to
obliterate their army with magic?
Nasuada shook her head in response when Eragon restated the objec-tion. “From what we know of
him, he won’t fight until Urû’baen itself is threatened. It doesn’t matter to Galbatorix if we destroy half the
Empire, so long as we come to him, not the other way around. Why should he bother anyway? If we do
manage to reach him, our troops will be bat-tered and depleted, making it all the easier for him to destroy
us.”
“You still haven’t answered Saphira,” protested Eragon.
“That’s because I can’t yet. This will be a long campaign. By its end you might be powerful enough to
defeat Galbatorix, or the elves may have joined us... and their spellcasters are the strongest in Alagaësia.
No matter what happens, we cannot afford to delay. Now is the time to gamble and dare what no one
thinks we can accomplish. The Varden have lived in the shadows for too long—we must either challenge
Galbatorix or sub-mit and pass away.”
The scope of what Nasuada was suggesting disturbed Eragon. So many risks and unknown dangers
were involved, it was almost absurd to con-sider such a venture. However, it was not his place to make
the decision, and he accepted that. Nor would he dispute it further. We have to trust in her judgment
now.
“But what of you, Nasuada? Will you be safe while we’re gone? I must think of my vow. It’s become
my responsibility to ensure that you won’t have your own funeral soon.”
Her jaw tightened as she gestured at the door and the warriors beyond. “You needn’t fear, I am well
defended.” She looked down. “I will admit... one reason for going to Surda is that Orrin knows me of
old and will offer his protection. I cannot tarry here with you and Arya gone and the Council of Elders
still with power. They won’t accept me as their leader until I prove beyond doubt that the Varden are
under my control, not theirs.”
Then she seemed to draw on some inner strength, squaring her shoul-ders and lifting her chin so she was
distant and aloof. “Go now, Eragon. Ready your horse, gather supplies, and be at the north gate by
dawn.”
He bowed low, respecting her return to formality, then left with Saphira.
After dinner, Eragon and Saphira flew together. They sailed high above Tronjheim, where crenulated

icicles hung from the sides of Farthen Dûr, forming a great white band around them. Though it was still
hours until night, it was already nearly dark within the mountain.
Eragon threw back his head, savoring the air on his face. He missed the wind—wind that would rush
through the grass and stir the clouds until everything was tousled and fresh. Wind that would bring rain
and storms and lash the trees so they bent. For that matter, I miss trees as well, he thought. Farthen
Dûr is an incredible place, but it’s as empty of plants and animals as Ajihad’s tomb.
Saphira agreed. The dwarves seem to think that gems take the place of flowers. She was silent as
the light continued to fade. When it was too dark for Eragon to see comfortably, she said, It’s late. We
should return.
All right.
She drifted toward the ground in great, lazy spirals, drawing nearer to Tronjheim—which glowed like a
beacon in the center of Farthen Dûr. They were still far from the city-mountain when she swung her head,
saying, Look.
He followed her gaze, but all he could see was the gray, featureless plain below them. What?
Instead of answering, she tilted her wings and glided to their left, slip-ping down to one of the four roads
that radiated from Tronjheim along the cardinal compass points. As they landed, he noticed a patch of
white on a small hill nearby. The patch wavered strangely in the dusk, like a floating candle, then resolved
into Angela, who was wearing a pale wool tunic.
The witch carried a wicker basket nearly four feet across and filled with a wild assortment of
mushrooms, most of which Eragon did not recognize. As she approached, he gestured at them and said,
“You’ve been gathering toadstools?”
“Hello,” laughed Angela, putting her load down. “Oh no, toadstool is far too general a term. And
anyway, they really ought to be called frogstools, not toadstools.” She spread them with her hand. “ This
one is sulphur tuft, and this is an inkcap, and here’s navelcap, and dwarf shield, russet tough-shank,
blood ring, and that is a spotted deceiver. Delightful, isn’t it!” She pointed to each in turn, ending on a
mushroom with pink, lavender, and yellow splashed in rivulets across its cap.
“And that one?” he asked, indicating a mushroom with a lightning-blue stem, molten-orange gills, and a
glossy black two-tiered cap.
She looked at it fondly. “Fricai Andlát, as the elves might say. The stalk is instant death, while the cap
can cure most poisons. It’s what Tunivor’s Nectar is extracted from. Fricai Andlát only grows in caves in
Du Wel-denvarden and Farthen Dûr, and it would die out here if the dwarves started carting their dung
elsewhere.”
Eragon looked back at the hill and realized that was exactly what it was, a dung heap.
“Hello, Saphira,” said Angela, reaching past him to pat Saphira on the nose. Saphira blinked and looked
pleased, tail twitching. At the same time, Solembum padded into sight, his mouth clamped firmly around a
limp rat. Without so much as a flick of his whiskers, the werecat settled on the ground and began to
nibble on the rodent, studiously ignoring the three of them.
“So,” said Angela, tucking back a curl of her enormous hair, “off to Ellesméra?” Eragon nodded. He did

not bother asking how she had found out; she always seemed to know what was going on. When he
remained silent, she scowled. “Well, don’t act so morose. It’s not as if it’s your exe-cution!”
“I know.”
“Then smile, because if it’s not your execution, you should be happy! You’re as flaccid as Solembum’s
rat. Flaccid. What a wonderful word, don’t you think?”
That wrung a grin out of him, and Saphira chortled with amusement deep in her throat. “I’m not sure it’s
quite as wonderful as you think, but yes, I understand your point.”
“I’m glad you understand. Understanding is good.” With arched eye-brows, she hooked a fingernail
underneath a mushroom and flipped it over, inspecting its gills as she said, “It’s fortuitous we met tonight,
as you are about to leave and I... I will accompany the Varden to Surda. As I told you before, I like to
be where things are happening, and that’s the place.”
Eragon grinned even more. “Well then, that must mean we’ll have a safe journey, else you’d be with us.”
Angela shrugged, then said seriously, “Be careful in Du Weldenvarden. Just because elves do not display
their emotions doesn’t mean they aren’t subject to rage and passion like the rest of us mortals. What can
make them so deadly, though, is how they conceal it, sometimes for years.”
“You’ve been there?”
“Once upon a time.”
After a pause, he asked, “What do you think of Nasuada’s plans?”
“Mmm... she’s doomed! You’re doomed! They’re all doomed!” She cackled, doubling over, then
straightened abruptly. “Notice I didn’t spec-ify what kind of doom, so no matter what happens, I
predicted it. How very wise of me.” She lifted the basket again, setting it on one hip. “I sup-pose I won’t
see you for a while, so farewell, best of luck, avoid roasted cabbage, don’t eat earwax, and look on the
bright side of life!” And with a cheery wink, she strolled off, leaving Eragon blinking and nonplussed.
After an appropriate pause, Solembum picked up his dinner and fol-lowed, ever so dignified.
HROTHGAR’S GIFT

Dawn was a half hour away when Eragon and Saphira arrived at Tron-jheim’s north gate. The gate was
raised just enough to let Saphira pass, so they hurried underneath it, then waited in the recessed area
beyond, where red jasper pillars loomed above and carved beasts snarled between the bloody piers.
Past those, at the very edge of Tronjheim, sat two thirty-foot-high gold griffins. Identical pairs guarded
each of the city-mountain’s gates. No one was in sight.
Eragon held Snowfire’s reins. The stallion was brushed, reshoed, and saddled, his saddlebags bulging
with goods. He pawed the floor impa-tiently; Eragon had not ridden him for over a week.
Before long Orik ambled up, bearing a large pack on his back and a bundle in his arms. “No horse?”
asked Eragon, somewhat surprised. Are we supposed to walk all the way to Du Weldenvarden?

Page 360

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Orik grunted. “We’ll be stopping at Tarnag, just north of here. From there we take rafts along the Az
Ragni to Hedarth, an outpost for trading with the elves. We won’t need steeds before Hedarth, so I’ll use
my own feet till then.”
He set the bundle down with a clang, then unwrapped it, revealing Er-agon’s armor. The shield had been
repainted—so the oak tree stood clearly in the center—and all the dings and scrapes removed. Beneath
it was the long mail shirt, burnished and oiled until the steel gleamed bril-liantly. No sign existed of where
it had been rent when Durza cut Er-agon’s back. The coif, gloves, bracers, greaves, and helmet were
likewise repaired.
“Our greatest smiths worked on these,” said Orik, “as well as your ar-mor, Saphira. However, since we
can’t take dragon armor with us, it was given to the Varden, who will guard it against our return.”
Please thank him for me,said Saphira.
Eragon obliged, then laced on the greaves and bracers, storing the other items in his bags. Last of all, he
reached for his helm, only to find Orik holding it. The dwarf rolled the piece between his hands, then said,
“Do not be so quick to don this, Eragon. There is a choice you must make first.”
“What choice is that?”
Raising the helmet, Orik uncovered its polished brow, which, Eragon now saw, had been altered: etched
in the steel were the hammer and stars of Hrothgar and Orik’s clan, the Ingeitum. Orik scowled, looking
both pleased and troubled, and said in a formal voice, “Mine king, Hroth-gar, desires that I present this
helm as a symbol of the friendship he bears for you. And with it Hrothgar extends an offer to adopt you
as one of Dûrgrimst Ingeitum, as a member of his own family.”
Eragon stared at the helm, amazed that Hrothgar would make such a gesture. Does this mean I’d be
subjected to his rule?... If I continue to accrue loyalties and allegiances at this pace, I’ll be
incapacitated before long— unable to do anything without breaking some oath!
You don’t have to put it on,pointed out Saphira.
And risk insulting Hrothgar? Once again, we’re trapped.
It may be intended as a gift, though, another sign of otho, not a trap. I would guess he’s thanking us for
my offer to repair Isidar Mithrim.
That had not occurred to Eragon, for he had been too busy trying to figure out how the dwarf king might
gain advantage over them. True. But I think it’s also an attempt to correct the imbalance of power
created when I swore fealty to Nasuada. The dwarves couldn’t have been pleased with that turn
of events. He looked back at Orik, who was waiting anxiously. “How often has this been done?”
“For a human? Never. Hrothgar argued with the Ingeitum families for a day and a night before they
agreed to accept you. If you consent to bear our crest, you will have full rights as clan member. You may
attend our councils and give voice on every issue. And,” he grew very somber, “if you so wish, you will
have the right to be buried with our dead.”
For the first time, the enormity of Hrothgar’s action struck Eragon. The dwarves could offer no higher
honor. With a swift motion, he took the helm from Orik and pressed it down upon his head. “I am

Page 361

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

privileged to join Dûrgrimst Ingeitum.”
Orik nodded with approval and said, “Then take this Knurlnien, this Heart of Stone, and cup it between
your hands—yes, like so. You must steel yourself now and prick open a vein to wet the stone. A few
drops will suffice.... To finish, repeat after me: Os il dom qirânû carn dûr thargen, zeitmen, oen grimst vor
formv edaris rak skilfz. Narho is belgond...” It was a lengthy recitation and all the longer because Orik
stopped to translate every few sentences. Afterward, Eragon healed his wrist with a quick spell.
“Whatever else the clans may say about this business,” observed Orik, “you have behaved with integrity
and respect. They cannot ignore that.” He grinned. “We are of the same clan now, eh? You are my foster
brother! Under more normal circumstances, Hrothgar would have pre-sented your helm himself and we
would have held a lengthy ceremony to commemorate your induction into Dûrgrimst Ingeitum, but events
move too swiftly for us to tarry. Fear not that you are being slighted, though! Your adoption shall be
celebrated with the proper rituals when you and Saphira next return to Farthen Dûr. You shall feast and
dance and have many pieces of paper to sign in order to formalize your new position.”
“I look forward to the day,” said Eragon. He was still preoccupied with sifting through the numerous
possible ramifications of belonging to Dûr-grimst Ingeitum.
Sitting against a pillar, Orik shrugged off his pack and drew his ax, which he proceeded to twirl between
his palms. After several minutes, he leaned forward, glaring back into Tronjheim. “Barzûl knurlar! Where
are they? Arya said she would be right here. Ha! Elves’ only concept of time is late and even later.”
“Have you dealt with them much?” asked Eragon, crouching. Saphira watched with interest.
The dwarf laughed suddenly. “Eta. Only Arya, and then sporadically be-cause she traveled so often. In
seven decades, I’ve learned but one thing about her: You can’t rush an elf. Trying is like hammering a
file—it might break, but it’ll never bend.”
“Aren’t dwarves the same?”
“Ah, but stone will shift, given enough time.” Orik sighed and shook his head. “Of all the races, elves
change the least, which is one reason I’m re-luctant to go.”
“But we’ll get to meet Queen Islanzadí and see Ellesméra and who knows what else? When was the last
time a dwarf was invited into Du Weldenvarden?”
Orik frowned at him. “Scenery means nothing. Urgent tasks remain in Tronjheim and our other cities, yet
I must tramp across Alagaësia to ex-change pleasantries and sit and grow fat as you are tutored. It could
take years!”
Years!... Still, if that’s what is required to defeat Shades and the Ra’zac, I’ll do it.
Saphira touched his mind: I doubt Nasuada will let us stay in Ellesméra for more than a few
months. With what she told us, we’ll be needed fairly soon.
“At last!” said Orik, pushing himself upright.
Approaching were Nasuada—slippers flashing beneath her dress, like mice darting from a
hole—Jörmundur, and Arya, who bore a pack like Orik’s. She wore the same black leather outfit
Eragon had first seen her in, as well as her sword.

Page 362

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

At that moment, it struck Eragon that Arya and Nasuada might not approve of him joining the Ingeitum.
Guilt and trepidation shot through him as he realized that it had been his duty to consult Nasuada first.
And Arya! He cringed, remembering how angry she had been after his first meeting with the Council of
Elders.
Thus, when Nasuada stopped before him, he averted his eyes, ashamed. But she only said, “You
accepted.” Her voice was gentle, restrained.
He nodded, still looking down.
“I wondered if you would. Now once again, all three races have a hold on you. The dwarves can claim
your allegiance as a member of Dûrgrimst Ingeitum, the elves will train and shape you—and their
influence may be the strongest, for you and Saphira are bound by their magic—and you have sworn
fealty to me, a human.... Perhaps it is best that we share your loyalty.” She met his surprise with an odd
smile, then pressed a small bag of coins into his palm and stepped away.
Jörmundur extended a hand, which Eragon shook, feeling a bit dazed. “Have a good trip, Eragon. Guard
yourself well.”
“Come,” said Arya, gliding past them into the darkness of Farthen Dûr. “It is time to leave. Aiedail has
set, and we have far to go.”
“Aye,” Orik agreed. He pulled out a red lantern from the side of his pack.
Nasuada looked them over once more. “Very well. Eragon and Saphira, you have the Varden’s
blessings, as well as mine. May your journey be safe. Remember, you carry the weight of our hopes and
expectations, so acquit yourselves honorably.”
“We will do our best,” promised Eragon.
Gripping Snowfire’s reins firmly, he started after Arya, who was already several yards away. Orik
followed, then Saphira. As Saphira passed Nasuada, Eragon saw her pause and lightly lick Nasuada on
the cheek. Then she lengthened her stride, catching up with him.
As they continued north along the road, the gate behind them shrank smaller and smaller until it was
reduced to a pinprick of light—with two lonely silhouettes where Nasuada and Jörmundur remained
watching.
When they finally reached Farthen Dûr’s base, they found a pair of gi-gantic doors—thirty feet
tall—open and waiting. Three dwarf guards bowed and moved away from the aperture. Through the
doors was a tunnel of matching proportions, lined with columns and lanterns for the first fifty feet. After
that it was as empty and silent as a mausoleum.
It looked exactly like Farthen Dûr’s western entrance, but Eragon knew that this tunnel was different.
Instead of burrowing through the mile-thick base to emerge outside, it proceeded underneath mountain
after mountain, all the way to the dwarf city Tarnag.
“Here is our path,” said Orik, lifting the lantern.
He and Arya crossed over the threshold, but Eragon held back, sud-denly uncertain. While he did not

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

fear the dark, neither did he welcome being surrounded by eternal night until they arrived at Tarnag. And
once he entered the barren tunnel, he would again be hurling himself into the unknown, abandoning the
few things he had grown accustomed to among the Varden in exchange for an uncertain destiny.
What is it?asked Saphira.
Nothing.
He took a breath, then strode forward, allowing the mountain to swallow him in its depths.
HAMMER AND TONGS

Three days after the Ra’zac’s arrival, Roran found himself pacing uncontrollably along the edge of his
camp in the Spine. He had heard nothing since Albriech’s visit, nor was it possible to glean information
by observing Carvahall. He glared at the distant tents where the soldiers slept, then continued pacing.
At midday Roran had a small, dry lunch. Wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, he wondered,
How long are the Ra’zac willing to wait? If it was a test of patience, he was determined to win.
To pass the time, he practiced his archery on a rotting log, stopping only when an arrow shattered on a
rock embedded in the trunk. After that nothing else remained to do, except to resume striding back and
forth along the bare track that stretched from a boulder to where he slept.
He was still pacing when footsteps sounded in the forest below. Grab-bing his bow, Roran hid and
waited. Relief rushed through him when Baldor’s face bobbed into view. Roran waved him over.
As they sat, Roran asked, “Why hasn’t anyone come?”
“We couldn’t,” said Baldor, wiping sweat off his brow. “The soldiers have been watching us too closely.
This was the first opportunity we had to get away. I can’t stay long either.” He turned his face toward the
peak above them and shuddered. “You’re braver than I, staying here. Have you had any trouble with
wolves, bears, mountain cats?”
“No, no, I’m fine. Did the soldiers say anything new?”
“One of them bragged to Morn last night that their squad was hand-picked for this mission.” Roran
frowned. “They haven’t been too quiet.... At least two or three of them get drunk each night. A group of
them tore up Morn’s common room the first day.”
“Did they pay for the damage?”
“’Course not.”
Roran shifted, staring down at the village. “I still have trouble believing that the Empire would go to these
lengths to capture me. What could I give them? What do they think I can give them?”
Baldor followed his gaze. “The Ra’zac questioned Katrina today. Some-one mentioned that the two of
you are close, and the Ra’zac were curious if she knew where you’d gone.”

Page 364

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Roran refocused on Baldor’s open face. “Is she all right?”
“It would take more than those two to scare her,” reassured Baldor. His next sentence was cautious and
probing. “Perhaps you should consider turning yourself in.”
“I’d sooner hang myself and them with me!” Roran started up and stalked over his usual route, still
tapping his leg. “How can you say that, knowing how they tortured my father?”
Catching his arm, Baldor said, “What happens if you remain in hiding and the soldiers don’t give up and
leave? They’ll assume we lied to help you escape. The Empire doesn’t forgive traitors.”
Roran shrugged off Baldor. He spun around, tapping his leg, then abruptly sat. If don’t show myself,
the Ra’zac will blame the people at hand. If I attempt to lead the Ra’zac away... Roran was not a
skilled enough woodsman to evade thirty men and the Ra’zac. Eragon could do it, but not me. Still,
unless the situation changed, it might be the only choice available to him.
He looked at Baldor. “I don’t want anyone to be hurt on my behalf. I’ll wait for now, and if the Ra’zac
grow impatient and threaten someone... Well then, I’ll think of something else to do.”
“It’s a nasty situation all around,” offered Baldor.
“One I intend to survive.”
Baldor departed soon afterward, leaving Roran alone with his thoughts on his endless path. He covered
mile after mile, grinding a rut into the earth under the weight of his ruminations. When chill dusk arrived,
he removed his boots—for fear of wearing them out—and proceeded to pad barefoot.
Just as the waxing moon rose and subsumed the night shadows in beams of marble light, Roran noticed a
disturbance in Carvahall. Scores of lanterns bobbed through the darkened village, winking in and out as
they floated behind houses. The yellow specks clustered in the center of Car-vahall, like a cloud of
fireflies, then streamed haphazardly toward the edge of town, where they were met by a hard line of
torches from the soldiers’ camp.
For two hours, Roran watched the opposing sides face each other—the agitated lanterns milling
helplessly against the stolid torches. Finally, the lambent groups dispersed and filtered back into the tents
and houses.
When nothing else of interest occurred, Roran untied his bedroll and slipped under the blankets.
Throughout the next day, Carvahall was consumed with unusual activ-ity. Figures strode between houses
and even, Roran was surprised to see, rode out into Palancar Valley toward various farms. At noon he
saw two men enter the soldiers’ camp and disappear into the Ra’zac’s tent for al-most an hour.
So involved was he with the proceedings, Roran barely moved the en-tire day.
He was in the middle of dinner when, as he had hoped, Baldor reap-peared. “Hungry?” asked Roran,
gesturing.
Baldor shook his head and sat with an air of exhaustion. Dark lines un-der his eyes made his skin look
thin and bruised. “Quimby’s dead.”

Page 365

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Roran’s bowl clattered as it struck the ground. He cursed, wiping cold stew off his leg, then asked,
“How?”
“A couple of soldiers started bothering Tara last night.” Tara was Morn’s wife. “She didn’t really mind,
except the men got in a fight over who she was supposed to serve next. Quimby was there—checking a
cask Morn said had turned—and he tried to break them up.” Roran nod-ded. That was Quimby, always
interfering to make sure others behaved properly. “Only thing is, a soldier threw a pitcher and hit him on
the temple. Killed him instantly.”
Roran stared at the ground with his hands on his hips, struggling to re-gain control over his ragged
breathing. He felt as if Baldor had knocked the wind out of him. It doesn’t seem possible.... Quimby,
gone? The farmer and part-time brewer was as much a part of the landscape as the moun-tains
surrounding Carvahall, an unquestioned presence that shaped the fabric of the village. “Will the men be
punished?”
Baldor held up his hand. “Right after Quimby died, the Ra’zac stole his body from the tavern and hauled
it out to their tents. We tried to get it back last night, but they wouldn’t talk with us.”
“I saw.”
Baldor grunted, rubbing his face. “Dad and Loring met with the Ra’zac today and managed to convince
them to release the body. The soldiers, however, won’t face any consequences.” He paused. “I was
about to leave when Quimby was handed over. You know what his wife got? Bones.”
“Bones!”
“Every one of them was nibbled clean—you could see the bite marks— and most had been cracked
open for the marrow.”
Disgust gripped Roran, as well as profound horror for Quimby’s fate. It was well known that a person’s
spirit could never rest until his body was given a proper burial. Revolted by the desecration, he asked,
“What, who, ate him then?”
“The soldiers were just as appalled. It must have been the Ra’zac.”
“Why? To what end?”
“I don’t think,” said Baldor, “that the Ra’zac are human. You’ve never seen them up close, but their
breath is foul, and they always cover their faces with black scarves. Their backs are humped and twisted,
and they speak to each other with clicks. Even their men seem to fear them.”
“If they aren’t human, then what kind of creatures can they be?” de-manded Roran. “They’re not
Urgals.”
“Who knows?”
Fear now joined Roran’s revulsion—fear of the supernatural. He saw it echoed on Baldor’s face as the
young man clasped his hands. For all the stories of Galbatorix’s misdeeds, it was still a shock to have the
king’s evil roosted among their homes. A sense of history settled on Roran as he re-alized he was
involved with forces he had previously been acquainted with only through songs and stories. “Something
should be done,” he muttered.

Page 366

The air grew warmer through the night, until by afternoon Palancar Valley shimmered and sweltered with
the unexpected spring heat. Car-vahall looked peaceful under the bald blue sky, yet Roran could feel the
sour resentment that clenched its inhabitants with malicious intensity. The calm was like a sheet stretched
taut in the wind.
Despite the aura of expectation, the day proved to be utterly boring; Roran spent most of his time
brushing Horst’s mare. At last he lay to sleep, looking up past the towering pines at the haze of stars that
adorned the night sky. They seemed so close, it felt as if he hurtled among them, falling toward the
blackest void.
The moon was setting when Roran woke, his throat raw from smoke. He coughed and rolled upright,
blinking as his eyes burned and watered. The noxious fumes made it difficult to breathe.
Roran grabbed his blankets and saddled the frightened mare, then spurred her farther up the mountain,
hoping to find clear air. It quickly became apparent that the smoke was ascending with him, so he turned
and cut sideways through the forest.
After several minutes spent maneuvering in the dark, they finally broke free and rode onto a ledge swept
clean by a breeze. Purging his lungs with long breaths, Roran scanned the valley for the fire. He spotted it
in an in-stant.
Carvahall’s hay barn glowed white in a cyclone of flames, transforming its precious contents into a
fountain of amber motes. Roran trembled as he watched the destruction of the town’s feed. He wanted
to scream and run through the forest to help with the bucket brigade, yet he could not force himself to
abandon his own safety.
Now a molten spark landed on Delwin’s house. Within seconds, the thatched roof exploded in a wave
of fire.
Roran cursed and tore his hair, tears streaming down his face. This was why mishandling fire was a
hanging offense in Carvahall. Was it an acci-dent? Was it the soldiers? Are the Ra’zac punishing the
villagers for shielding me?... Am I somehow responsible for this?
Fisk’s house joined the conflagration next. Aghast, Roran could only avert his face, hating himself for his
cowardice.
By dawn all the fires had been extinguished or burned out on their own. Only sheer luck and a calm night
saved the rest of Carvahall from being consumed.
Roran waited until he was sure of the outcome, then retreated to his old camp and threw himself down
to rest. From morning through eve-ning, he was oblivious to the world, except through the lens of his
trou-bled dreams.
Upon his return to awareness, Roran simply waited for the visitor he was sure would appear. This time it
was Albriech. He arrived at dusk with a grim, worn expression. “Come with me,” he said.
Roran tensed. “Why?” Have they decided to give me up? If he was the cause of the fire, he could
understand the villagers wanting him gone. He might even agree it was necessary. It was unreasonable to

Page 367

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

expect every-one in Carvahall to sacrifice themselves for him. Still, that did not mean he would allow
them to just hand him over to the Ra’zac. After what the two monsters had done to Quimby, Roran
would fight to the death to avoid being their prisoner.
“Because,” said Albriech, clenching his jaw muscles, “it was the soldiers who started the fire. Morn
banned them from the Seven Sheaves, but they still got drunk on their own beer. One of them dropped a
torch against the hay barn on his way to bed.”
“Was anyone hurt?” asked Roran.
“A few burns. Gertrude was able to handle them. We tried to negotiate with the Ra’zac. They spat on
our requests that the Empire replace our losses and the guilty face justice. They even refused to confine
the sol-diers to the tents.”
“So why should I return?”
Albriech chuckled hollowly. “For hammer and tongs. We need your help to... removethe Ra’zac.”
“You would do that for me?”
“We’re not risking ourselves for your sake alone. This concerns the en-tire village now. At least come
talk to Father and the others and hear their thoughts... I’d think you would be glad to get out of these
cursed mountains.”
Roran considered Albriech’s proposition long and hard before deciding to accompany him. It’s this or
run for it, and I can always run later . He fetched the mare, tied his bags to the saddle, then followed
Albriech to-ward the valley floor.
Their progress slowed as they neared Carvahall, using trees and brush for cover. Slipping behind a rain
barrel, Albriech checked to see if the streets were clear, then signaled to Roran. Together they crept
from shadow to shade, constantly on guard for the Empire’s servants. At Horst’s forge, Albriech opened
one of the double doors just far enough for Roran and the mare to quietly enter.
Inside, the workshop was lit by a single candle, which cast a trembling glow over the ring of faces that
hovered about it in the surrounding darkness. Horst was there—his thick beard protruded like a shelf into
the light—flanked by the hard visages of Delwin, Gedric, and then Loring. The rest of the group was
composed of younger men: Baldor, Loring’s three sons, Parr, and Quimby’s boy, Nolfavrell, who was
only thirteen.
They all turned to look as Roran entered the assembly. Horst said, “Ah, you made it. You escaped
misfortune while in the Spine?”
“I was lucky.”
“Then we can proceed.”
“With what, exactly?” Roran hitched the mare to an anvil as he spoke.
Loring answered, the shoemaker’s parchment face a mass of contorting lines and grooves. “We have
attempted reason with these Ra’zac... these invaders. ” He stopped, his thin frame racked with an
unpleasant, metal-lic wheeze deep in his chest. “They have refused reason. They have en-dangered us all

with no sign of remorse or contrition. ” He made a noise in his throat, then said with pronounced
deliberation, “They... must... go. Such creatures—”
“No,” said Roran. “Not creatures. Desecrators.”
The faces scowled and bobbed in agreement. Delwin picked up the thread of conversation: “The point
is, everyone’s life is at stake. If that fire had spread any farther, dozens of people would have been killed
and those who escaped would have lost everything they own. As a result, we’ve agreed to drive the
Ra’zac away from Carvahall. Will you join us?”
Roran hesitated. “What if they return or send for reinforcements? We can’t defeat the entire Empire.”
“No,” said Horst, grave and solemn, “but neither can we stand silent and allow the soldiers to kill us and
to destroy our property. A man can en-dure only so much abuse before he must strike back.”
Loring laughed, throwing back his head so the flame gilded the stumps of his teeth. “First we fortify,” he
whispered with glee, “then we fight. We’ll make them regret they ever clapped their festering eyes on
Carva-hall! Ha ha!”
RETALIATION

After Roran agreed to their plan, Horst began distributing shovels, pitchforks, flails—anything that could
be used to beat the soldiers and the Ra’zac away.
Roran hefted a pick, then set it aside. Though he had never cared for Brom’s stories, one of them, the
“Song of Gerand,” resonated with him whenever he heard it. It told of Gerand, the greatest warrior of his
time, who relinquished his sword for a wife and farm. He found no peace, however, as a jealous lord
initiated a blood feud against Gerand’s family, which forced Gerand to kill once more. Yet he did not
fight with his blade, but with a simple hammer.
Going to the wall, Roran removed a medium-sized hammer with a long handle and a rounded blade on
one side of the head. He tossed it from hand to hand, then went to Horst and asked, “May I have this?”
Horst eyed the tool and Roran. “Use it wisely.” Then he said to the rest of the group, “Listen. We want
to scare, not kill. Break a few bones if you want, but don’t get carried away. And whatever you do,
don’t stand and fight. No matter how brave or heroic you feel, remember that they are trained soldiers.”
When everyone was equipped, they left the forge and wound their way through Carvahall to the edge of
the Ra’zac’s camp. The soldiers had al-ready gone to bed, except for four sentries who patrolled the
perimeter of the gray tents. The Ra’zac’s two horses were picketed by a smoldering fire.
Horst quietly issued orders, sending Albriech and Delwin to ambush two of the sentries, and Parr and
Roran to ambush the other two.
Roran held his breath as he stalked the oblivious soldier. His heart be-gan to shudder as energy spiked
through his limbs. He hid behind the corner of a house, quivering, and waited for Horst’s signal. Wait.
Wait.

Page 369

With a roar, Horst burst from hiding, leading the charge into the tents. Roran darted forward and swung
his hammer, catching the sentry on the shoulder with a grisly crunch.
The man howled and dropped his halberd. He staggered as Roran struck his ribs and back. Roran
raised the hammer again and the man re-treated, screaming for help.
Roran ran after him, shouting incoherently. He knocked in the side of a wool tent, trampling whatever
was inside, then smashed the top of a helmet he saw emerging from another tent. The metal rang like a
bell. Roran barely noticed as Loring danced past—the old man cackled and hooted in the night as he
jabbed the soldiers with a pitchfork. Every-where was a confusion of struggling bodies.
Whirling around, Roran saw a soldier attempting to string his bow. He rushed forward and hit the back
of the bow with his steel mallet, break-ing the wood in two. The soldier fled.
The Ra’zac scrambled free of their tent with terrible screeches, swords in hand. Before they could
attack, Baldor untethered the horses and sent them galloping toward the two scarecrow figures. The
Ra’zac separated, then regrouped, only to be swept away as the soldiers’ morale broke and they ran.
Then it was over.
Roran panted in the silence, his hand cramped around the hammer’s handle. After a moment, he picked
his way through the crumpled mounds of tents and blankets to Horst. The smith was grinning under his
beard. “That’s the best brawl I’ve had in years.”
Behind them, Carvahall jumped to life as people tried to discover the source of the commotion. Roran
watched lamps flare up behind shut-tered windows, then turned as he heard soft sobbing.
The boy, Nolfavrell, was kneeling by the body of a soldier, methodi-cally stabbing him in the chest as
tears slid down his chin. Gedric and Al-briech hurried over and pulled Nolfavrell away from the corpse.
“He shouldn’t have come,” said Roran.
Horst shrugged. “It was his right.”
All the same, killing one of the Ra’zac’s men will only make it harder to rid ourselves of the desecrators.
“ We should barricade the road and be-tween the houses so they won’t catch us by surprise.” Studying
the men for any injuries, Roran saw that Delwin had received a long cut on his forearm, which the farmer
bandaged with a strip torn from his ruined shirt.
With a few shouts, Horst organized their group. He dispatched Al-briech and Baldor to retrieve
Quimby’s wagon from the forge and had Loring’s sons and Parr scour Carvahall for items that could be
used to se-cure the village.
Even as he spoke, people congregated on the edge of the field, staring at what was left of the Ra’zac’s
camp and the dead soldier. “What hap-pened?” cried Fisk.
Loring scuttled forward and stared the carpenter in the eye. “What happened? I’ll tell you what
happened. We routed the dung-beardlings... caught them with their boots off and whipped them like
dogs!”
“I am glad.” The strong voice came from Birgit, an auburn-haired woman who clasped Nolfavrell against

Page 370

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

her bosom, ignoring the blood smeared across his face. “They deserve to die like cowards for my
hus-band’s death.”
The villagers murmured in agreement, but then Thane spoke: “Have you gone mad, Horst? Even if you
frightened off the Ra’zac and their sol-diers, Galbatorix will just send more men. The Empire will never
give up until they get Roran.”
“We should hand him over,” snarled Sloan.
Horst raised his hands. “I agree; no one is worth more than all of Carva-hall. But if we surrender Roran,
do you really think Galbatorix will let us escape punishment for our resistance? In his eyes, we’re no
better than the Varden.”
“Then why did you attack?” demanded Thane. “Who gave you the au-thority to make this decision?
You’ve doomed us all!”
This time Birgit answered. “Would you let them kill your wife?” She pressed her hands on either side of
her son’s face, then showed Thane her bloody palms, like an accusation. “Would you let them burn us?...
Where is your manhood, loam breaker?”
He lowered his gaze, unable to face her stark expression.
“They burned my farm,” said Roran, “devoured Quimby, and nearly destroyed Carvahall. Such crimes
cannot go unpunished. Are we frightened rabbits to cower down and accept our fate? No! We have a
right to de-fend ourselves.” He stopped as Albriech and Baldor trudged up the street, dragging the
wagon. “We can debate later. Now we have to prepare. Who will help us?”
Forty or more men volunteered. Together they set about the difficult task of making Carvahall
impenetrable. Roran worked incessantly, nailing fence slats between houses, piling barrels full of rocks
for makeshift walls, and dragging logs across the main road, which they blocked with two wagons tipped
on their sides.
As Roran hurried from one chore to another, Katrina waylaid him in an alley. She hugged him, then said,
“I’m glad you’re back, and that you’re safe.”
He kissed her lightly. “Katrina... I have to speak with you as soon as we’re finished.” She smiled
uncertainly, but with a spark of hope. “You were right; it was foolish of me to delay. Every moment we
spend to-gether is precious, and I have no desire to squander what time we have when a whim of fate
could tear us apart.”
Roran was tossing water on the thatching of Kiselt’s house—so it could not catch fire—when Parr
shouted, “Ra’zac!”
Dropping the bucket, Roran ran to the wagons, where he had left his hammer. As he grabbed the
weapon, he saw a single Ra’zac sitting on a horse far down the road, almost out of bowshot. The
creature was illu-minated by a torch in its left hand, while its right was drawn back, as if to throw
something.
Roran laughed. “Is he going to toss rocks at us? He’s too far away to even hit—” He was cut off as the
Ra’zac whipped down its arm and a glass vial arched across the distance between them and shattered
against the wagon to his right. An instant later, a fireball launched the wagon into the air while a fist of

Page 371

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

burning air flung Roran against a wall.
Dazed, he fell to his hands and knees, gasping for breath. Through the roaring in his ears came the tattoo
of galloping horses. He forced himself upright and faced the sound, only to dive aside as the Ra’zac
raced into Carvahall through the burning gap in the wagons.
The Ra’zac reined in their steeds, blades flashing as they hacked at the people strewn around them.
Roran saw three men die, then Horst and Loring reached the Ra’zac and began pressing them back with
pitchforks. Before the villagers could rally, soldiers poured through the breach, kill-ing indiscriminately in
the darkness.
Roran knew they had to be stopped, else Carvahall would be taken. He jumped at a soldier, catching
him by surprise, and hit him in the face with the hammer’s blade. The soldier crumpled without a sound.
As the man’s compatriots rushed toward him, Roran wrestled the corpse’s shield off his limp arm. He
barely managed to get it free in time to block the first strike.
Backstepping toward the Ra’zac, Roran parried a sword thrust, then swung his hammer up under the
man’s chin, sending him to the ground. “To me!” shouted Roran. “Defend your homes!” He sidestepped
a jab as five men attempted to encircle him. “To me!”
Baldor answered his call first, then Albriech. A few seconds later, Lor-ing’s sons joined him, followed
by a score of others. From the side streets, women and children pelted the soldiers with rocks. “Stay
together,” or-dered Roran, standing his ground. “There are more of us.”
The soldiers halted as the line of villagers before them continued to thicken. With more than a hundred
men at his back, Roran slowly ad-vanced.
“Attack, you foolsss,” screamed a Ra’zac, dodging Loring’s pitchfork.
A single arrow whizzed toward Roran. He caught it on his shield and laughed. The Ra’zac were level
with the soldiers now, hissing with frus-tration. They glared at the villagers from under their inky cowls.
Sud-denly Roran felt himself become lethargic and powerless to move; it was hard to even think. Fatigue
seemed to chain his arms and legs in place.
Then from farther in Carvahall, Roran heard a raw shout from Birgit. A second later, a rock hurtled over
his head and bored toward the lead Ra’zac, who twitched with supernatural speed to avoid the missile.
The distraction, slight though it was, freed Roran’s mind from the soporific influence. Was that magic?
he wondered.
He dropped the shield, grasped his hammer with both hands, and raised it far above his head—just like
Horst did when spreading metal. Roran went up on tiptoe, his entire body bowed backward, then
whipped his arms down with a huh! The hammer cartwheeled through the air and bounced off the
Ra’zac’s shield, leaving a formidable dent.
The two attacks were enough to disrupt the last of the Ra’zac’s strange power. They clicked rapidly to
each other as the villagers roared and marched forward, then the Ra’zac yanked on their reins, wheeling
around.
“Retreat,” they growled, riding past the soldiers. The crimson-clad war-riors sullenly backed out of
Carvahall, stabbing at anyone who came too close. Only when they were a good distance from the
burning wagons did they dare turn their backs.

Page 372

Roran sighed and retrieved his hammer, feeling the bruises on his side and back where he had hit the
wall. He bowed his head as he saw that the explosion had killed Parr. Nine other men had died. Already
wives and mothers rent the night with their wails of grief.
How could this happen here?
“Everyone, come!” called Baldor.
Roran blinked and stumbled to the middle of the road, where Baldor stood. A Ra’zac sat beetle-like on
a horse only twenty yards away. The creature crooked a finger at Roran and said, “You... you sssmell
like your cousin. We never forget a sssmell.”
“What do you want?” he shouted. “Why are you here?”
The Ra’zac chuckled in a horrible, insectile way. “We want... information.” It glanced over its shoulder,
where its companions had disappeared, then cried, “Release Roran and you ssshall be sold as ssslaves.
Protect him, and we will eat you all. We ssshall have your an-swer when next we come. Be sssure it is
the right one.”
AZ SWELDN RAK ANHÛIN

Light burst into the tunnel as the doors dragged open. Eragon winced, his eyes sorely unaccustomed to
daylight after so long underground. Be-side him, Saphira hissed and arched her neck to get a better view
of their surroundings.
It had taken them two days to traverse the subterranean passage from Farthen Dûr, though it felt longer
to Eragon, due to the never-ending dusk that surrounded them and the silence it had imposed upon their
group. In all, he could recall only a handful of words being exchanged during their journey.
Eragon had hoped to learn more about Arya while they traveled to-gether, but the only information he
had gleaned came simply as a result of observation. He had not supped with her before and was startled
to see that she brought her own food and ate no meat. When he asked her why, she said, “You will
never again consume an animal’s flesh after you have been trained, or if you do, it will be only on the
rarest of occasions.”
“Why should I give up meat?” he scoffed.
“I cannot explain with words, but you will understand once we reach Ellesméra.”
All that was forgotten now as he hurried to the threshold, eager to see their destination. He found himself
standing on a granite outcropping, more than a hundred feet above a purple-hued lake, brilliant under the
eastern sun. Like Kóstha-mérna, the water reached from mountain to mountain, filling the valley’s end.
From the lake’s far side, the Az Ragni flowed north, winding between the peaks until—in the far
distance—it rushed out onto the eastern plains.
To his right, the mountains were bare, save for a few trails, but to his left... to his left was the dwarf city
Tarnag. Here the dwarves had re-worked the seemingly immutable Beors into a series of terraces. The
lower terraces were mainly farms—dark curves of land waiting to be planted—dotted with squat halls,

Page 373

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

which as best he could tell were built entirely of stone. Above those empty levels rose tier upon tier of
inter-locking buildings until they culminated in a giant dome of gold and white. It was as if the entire city
was nothing more than a line of steps leading to the dome. The cupola glistened like polished moonstone,
a milky bead floating atop a pyramid of gray slate.
Orik anticipated Eragon’s question, saying, “That is Celbedeil, the great-est temple of dwarfdom and
home of Dûrgrimst Quan—the Quan clan— who act as servants and messengers to the gods.”
Do they rule Tarnag?asked Saphira. Eragon repeated the query.
“Nay,” said Arya, stepping past them. “Though the Quan are strong, they are small in numbers, despite
their power over the afterlife... and gold. It is the Ragni Hefthyn—the River Guard—who control Tarnag.
We will stay with their clan chief, Ûndin, while here.”
As they followed the elf off the outcropping and through the gnarled forest that blanketed the mountain,
Orik whispered to Eragon, “Mind her not. She has been arguing with the Quan for many a year. Every
time she visits Tarnag and speaks with a priest, it produces a quarrel fierce enough to scare a Kull.”
“Arya?”
Orik nodded grimly. “I know little of it, but I’ve heard she disagrees strongly with much that the Quan
practice. It seems that elves do not hold with ‘muttering into the air for help.’ ”
Eragon stared at Arya’s back as they descended, wondering if Orik’s words were true, and if so, what
Arya herself believed. He took a deep breath, pushing the matter from his mind. It felt wonderful to be
back in the open, where he could smell the moss and ferns and trees of the forest, where the sun was
warm on his face and bees and other insects swarmed pleasantly.
The path took them down to the edge of the lake before rising back toward Tarnag and its open gates.
“How have you hidden Tarnag from Galbatorix?” asked Eragon. “Farthen Dûr I understand, but this...
I’ve never seen anything like it.”
Orik laughed softly. “Hide it? That would be impossible. No, after the Riders fell, we were forced to
abandon all our cities aboveground and re-treat into our tunnels in order to escape Galbatorix and the
Forsworn. They would often fly through the Beors, killing anyone who they en-countered.”
“I thought that dwarves always lived underground.”
Orik’s thick eyebrows met in a frown. “Why should we? We may have an affinity for stone, but we like
the open air as much as elves or humans. However, it has only been in the last decade and a half, ever
since Mor-zan died, that we have dared return to Tarnag and other of our ancient dwellings. Galbatorix
may be unnaturally powerful, but even he would not attack an entire city alone. Of course, he and his
dragon could cause us no end of trouble if they wanted, but these days they rarely leave Urû’baen, even
for short trips. Nor could Galbatorix bring an army here without first defeating Buragh or Farthen Dûr.”
Which he nearly did,commented Saphira.
Cresting a small mound, Eragon jolted with surprise as an animal crashed through the underbrush and
onto the path. The scraggly creature looked like a mountain goat from the Spine, except that it was a
third larger and had giant ribbed horns that curled around its cheeks, making an Urgal’s seem no bigger
than a swallow nest. Odder still was the saddle lashed across the goat’s back and the dwarf seated firmly

Page 374

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

on it, aiming a half-drawn bow into the air.
“Hert dûrgrimst? Fild rastn?” shouted the strange dwarf.
“Orik Thrifkz menthiv oen Hrethcarach Eragon rak Dûrgrimst Ingei-tum,” answered Orik. “Wharn, az
vanyali-carharûg Arya. Né oc Ûndinz grimstbelardn.” The goat stared warily at Saphira. Eragon noted
how bright and intelligent its eyes were, though its face was rather droll with its frosty beard and somber
expression. It reminded him of Hrothgar, and he almost laughed, thinking how very dwarfish the animal
was.
“Azt jok jordn rast,” came the reply.
With no discernible command on the dwarf’s part, the goat leaped forward, covering such an
extraordinary distance it seemed to take flight for a moment. Then rider and steed vanished between the
trees.
“What was that?” asked Eragon, amazed.
Orik resumed walking. “A Feldûnost, one of the five animals unique to these mountains. A clan is named
after each one. However, Dûrgrimst Feldûnost is perhaps the bravest and most revered of the clans.”
“Why so?”
“We depend upon Feldûnost for milk, wool, and meat. Without their sustenance, we could not live in the
Beors. When Galbatorix and his trai-torous Riders were terrorizing us, it was Dûrgrimst Feldûnost who
risked themselves—and still do—to tend the herds and fields. As such, we are all in their debt.”
“Do all dwarves ride Feldûnost?” He stumbled slightly over the unusual word.
“Only in the mountains. Feldûnost are hardy and sure-footed, but they are better suited for cliffs than
open plains.”
Saphira nudged Eragon with her nose, causing Snowfire to shy away. Now those would be good
hunting, better than any I had in the Spine or hence! If I have time in Tarnag—
No,he said. We can’t afford to offend the dwarves.
She snorted, irritated. I could ask permission first.
Now the path that had concealed them for so long under dark boughs entered the great clearing that
surrounded Tarnag. Groups of observers had already begun to gather in the fields when seven Feldûnost
with jew-eled harnesses bounded out from the city. Their riders bore lances tipped with pennants that
snapped like whips in the air. Reining in his strange beast, the lead dwarf said, “Thou art well-come to
this city of Tarnag. By otho of Ûndin and Gannel, I, Thorv, son of Brokk, offer in peace the shelter of our
halls.” His accent grumbled and rasped with a rough burr quite unlike Orik’s.
“And by Hrothgar’s otho, we of the Ingeitum accept your hospitality,” responded Orik.
“As do I, in Islanzadí’s stead,” added Arya.
Appearing satisfied, Thorv motioned to his fellow riders, who spurred their Feldûnost into formation

Page 375

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

around the four of them. With a flourish, the dwarves rode off, guiding them to Tarnag and through the
city gates.
The outer wall was forty feet thick and formed a shadowed tunnel to the first of the many farms that
belted Tarnag. Five more tiers—each of which was defended by a fortified gate—carried them past the
fields and into the city proper.
In contrast to Tarnag’s thickly built ramparts, the buildings within, though of stone, were shaped with
such cunning as to give the impres-sion of grace and lightness. Strong, bold carvings, usually of animals,
adorned the houses and shops. But even more striking was the stone it-self: vibrant hues, from bright
scarlet to the subtlest of greens, glazed the rock in translucent layers.
And hung throughout the city were the dwarves’ flameless lanterns, their multicolored sparks harbingers
of the Beors’ long dusk and night.
Unlike Tronjheim, Tarnag had been constructed in proportion to the dwarves, with no concession for
human, elf, or dragon visitors. At the most, doorways were five feet high, and they were often only four
and a half. Eragon was of middling height, but now he felt like a giant trans-ported onto a puppet stage.
The streets were wide and crammed. Dwarves of various clans hurried about their business or stood
haggling in and around shops. Many were garbed in strange, exotic costumes, such as a block of fierce
black-haired dwarves who wore silver helmets forged in the likeness of wolf heads.
Eragon stared at the dwarf women the most, as he had only caught brief glimpses of them while in
Tronjheim. They were broader than the men, and their faces were heavyset, yet their eyes sparkled and
their hair was lustrous and their hands were gentle on their diminutive children. They eschewed frippery,
except for small, intricate brooches of iron and stone.
At the Feldûnost’s piercing footsteps, the dwarves turned to look at the new arrivals. They did not cheer
as Eragon had expected, but rather bowed and murmured, “Shadeslayer.” As they saw the hammer and
stars upon Eragon’s helm, admiration was replaced by shock and, in many cases, outrage. A number of
the angrier dwarves contracted around the Feldûnost, glaring between the animals at Eragon and shouting
impreca-tions.
The back of Eragon’s neck prickled. It seems that adopting me wasn’t the most popular decision
Hrothgar could make.
Aye,agreed Saphira. He may have strengthened his hold on you, but at the cost of alienating many
of the dwarves.... We’d better get out of sight be-fore blood is shed.
Thorv and the other guards rode forward as if the crowd was nonexis-tent, clearing the way through
seven additional tiers until only a single gate separated them from the mass of Celbedeil. Then Thorv
turned left, toward a great hall pressed against the side of the mountain and pro-tected in fore by a
barbican with two machicolated towers.
As they neared the hall, a group of armed dwarves streamed out from between the houses and formed a
thick line, blocking the street. Long purple veils covered their faces and draped over their shoulders, like
mail coifs.
The guards immediately reined in their Feldûnost, faces hard. “What is it?” Eragon asked Orik, but the
dwarf only shook his head and strode forward, a hand on his ax.

Page 376

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“Etzil nithgech!” cried a veiled dwarf, raising a fist. “Formv Hrethca-rach... formv Jurgencarmeitder nos
eta goroth bahst Tarnag, dûr encesti rak kythn! Jok is warrev az barzûlegûr dûr dûrgrimst, Az Sweldn
rak An-hûin, môgh tor rak Jurgenvren? Né ûdim etal os rast knurlag. Knurlag ana...” For a long minute,
he continued to rant with growing spleen.
“Vrron!” barked Thorv, cutting him off, then the two dwarves began arguing. Despite the harsh
exchange, Eragon saw that Thorv seemed to respect the other dwarf.
Eragon shifted to the side—trying to get a better view past Thorv’s Feldûnost—and the veiled dwarf
abruptly fell silent, jabbing at Eragon’s helm with an expression of horror.
“Knurlag qana qirânû Dûrgrimst Ingeitum!” he screamed. “Qarzûl ana Hrothgar oen volfild—”
“Jok is frekk dûrgrimstvren?” interrupted Orik quietly, drawing his ax. Worried, Eragon glanced at Arya,
but she was too intent on the confron-tation to notice him. He surreptitiously slid his hand down and
around Zar’roc’s wire-wrapped hilt.
The strange dwarf stared hard at Orik, then removed an iron ring from his pocket, plucked three hairs
from his beard, twined them around the ring, and threw it onto the street with an impervious clink, spitting
after it. Without a word, the purple-shrouded dwarves filed away.
Thorv, Orik, and the other warriors flinched as the ring bounced across the granite pavement. Even Arya
seemed taken aback. Two of the younger dwarves blanched and reached for their blades, then dropped
their hands as Thorv barked, “Eta!”
Their reactions unsettled Eragon far more than the raucous exchange had. As Orik strode forward alone
and deposited the ring in a pouch, Er-agon asked, “What does it mean?”
“It means,” said Thorv, “that you have enemies.”
They hurried through the barbican to a wide courtyard arrayed with three banquet tables, decorated with
lanterns and banners. Before the ta-bles stood a group of dwarves, foremost among them a
gray-bearded dwarf swathed in wolfskin. He spread his arms, saying, “Welcome to Tarnag, home of
Dûrgrimst Ragni Hefthyn. We have heard much praise of you, Eragon Shadeslayer. I am Ûndin, son of
Derûnd and clan chief.”
Another dwarf stepped forward. He had the shoulders and chest of a warrior, topped with hooded
black eyes that never left Eragon’s face. “And I, Gannel, son of Orm Blood-ax and clan chief of
Dûrgrimst Quan.”
“It is an honor to be your guests,” said Eragon, inclining his head. He felt Saphira’s irritation at being
ignored. Patience, he murmured, forcing a smile.
She snorted.
The clan chiefs greeted Arya and Orik in turn, but their hospitality was lost on Orik, whose only
response was to extend his hand, the iron ring on his palm.
Ûndin’s eyes widened, and he gingerly lifted the ring, pinching it be-tween his thumb and forefinger as if
it were a venomous snake. “Who gave this to you?”

Page 377

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“It was Az Sweldn rak Anhûin. And not to me, but to Eragon.”
As alarm spread across their faces, Eragon’s earlier apprehension re-turned. He had seen lone dwarves
face an entire group of Kull without shirking. The ring must symbolize something dreadful indeed if it
could undermine their courage.
Ûndin frowned as he listened to the muttering of his advisers, then said, “We must consult on this issue.
Shadeslayer, a feast is prepared in your honor. If you would allow my servants to guide you to your
quarters, you can refresh yourself, and then we might begin.”
“Of course.” Eragon handed Snowfire’s reins to a waiting dwarf and fol-lowed a guide into the hall. As
he passed through the doorway, he glanced back and saw Arya and Orik bustling away with the clan
chiefs, their heads pressed close together. I won’t be long, he promised Saphira.
After crouching through dwarf-sized corridors, he was relieved that the room assigned to him was
spacious enough to stand freely. The servant bowed and said, “I will return when Grimstborith Ûndin is
ready.”
Once the dwarf was gone, Eragon paused and took a deep breath, grate-ful for the silence. The
encounter with the veiled dwarves hovered in his mind, making it difficult for him to relax. At least we
won’t be in Tarnag long. That should prevent them from hindering us.
Peeling off his gloves, Eragon went to a marble basin set on the floor next to the low bed. He put his
hands in the water, then jerked them out with an involuntary yelp. The water was almost boiling. It
mustbea dwarf custom, he realized. He waited until it cooled a bit, then doused his face and neck,
rubbing them clean as steam swirled off his skin.
Rejuvenated, he stripped out of his breeches and tunic and outfitted himself in the clothes he had worn to
Ajihad’s funeral. He touched Zar’roc, but decided it would only insult Ûndin’s table and instead belted
on his hunting knife.
Then, from his pack, he took the scroll Nasuada had charged him with delivering to Islanzadí and
weighed it in his hand, wondering where to hide it. The missive was too important to leave out in the
open, where it could be read or stolen. Unable to think of a better place, he slipped the scroll up his
sleeve. It’ll be safe there unless I get into a fight, in which case I’ll have bigger problems to worry
about.
When at last the servant returned for Eragon, it was only an hour or so past noon, but the sun had
already vanished behind the looming moun-tains, plunging Tarnag into dusk. Exiting the hall, Eragon was
struck by the city’s transformation. With the premature advent of night, the dwarves’ lanterns revealed
their true strength, flooding the streets with pure, unwavering light that made the entire valley glow.
Ûndin and the other dwarves were gathered in the courtyard, along with Saphira, who had situated
herself at the head of a table. No one ap-peared interested in disputing her choice.
Has anything happened?asked Eragon, hurrying toward her.
Ûndin summoned extra warriors, then had the gates barred.
Does he expect an attack?

At the very least, he’s concerned about the possibility.
“Eragon, please join me,” said Ûndin, gesturing at the chair to his right. The clan chief seated himself as
Eragon did, and the rest of the company hurriedly followed suit.
Eragon was happy when Orik ended up beside him with Arya directly across the table, although both
looked grim. Before he could ask Orik about the ring, Ûndin slapped the table and roared, “Ignh az
voth!”
Servants streamed out of the hall, bearing platters of beaten gold piled high with meats, pies, and fruit.
They divided into three columns—one for each table—and deposited the dishes with a flourish.
Before them were soups and stews filled with various tubers, roasted venison, long hot loaves of
sourdough bread, and rows of honeycakes dripped with raspberry preserve. In a bed of greens lay
filleted trout gar-nished with parsley, and on the side, pickled eel stared forlornly at an urn of cheese, as if
hoping to somehow escape back into a river. A swan sat on each table, surrounded by a flock of stuffed
partridges, geese, and ducks.
Mushrooms were everywhere: broiled in juicy strips, placed atop a bird’s head like a bonnet, or carved
in the shape of castles amid moats of gravy. An incredible variety was on display, from puffy white
mushrooms the size of Eragon’s fist, to ones he could have mistaken for gnarled bark, to delicate
toadstools sliced neatly in half to showcase their blue flesh.
Then the centerpiece of the feast was revealed: a gigantic roasted boar, glistening with sauce. At least
Eragon thought it was a boar, for the car-cass was as large as Snowfire and took six dwarves to carry.
The tusks were longer than his forearms, the snout as wide as his head. And the smell, it overwhelmed all
others in pungent waves that made his eyes water from their strength.
“Nagra,” whispered Orik. “Giant boar. Ûndin truly honors you tonight, Eragon. Only the bravest
dwarves dare hunt Nagran, and it is only served to those who have great valor. Also, I think he makes a
gesture that he will support you over Dûrgrimst Nagra.”
Eragon leaned toward him so no one else could hear. “Then this is an-other animal native to the Beors?
What are the rest?”
“Forest wolves big enough to prey on a Nagra and nimble enough to catch Feldûnost. Cave bears,
which we call Urzhadn and the elves call Beorn and for which they dubbed these peaks, though we do
not call them such ourselves. The mountains’ name is a secret that we share with no race. And—”
“Smer voth,” commanded Ûndin, smiling at his guests. The servants immediately drew small curved
knives and cut portions of the Nagra, which they set on everyone’s plates—except for Arya’s—
including a weighty piece for Saphira. Ûndin smiled again, took a dagger, and sliced off a bit of his meat.
Eragon reached for his own knife, but Orik grabbed his arm. “Wait.”
Ûndin chewed slowly, rolling his eyes and nodding in an exaggerated fashion, then swallowed and
proclaimed, “Ilf gauhnith!”
“Now,” said Orik, turning to the meal as conversation erupted along the tables.

Eragon had never tasted anything like the boar. It was juicy, soft, and oddly spicy—as if the meat had
been soaked in honey and cider—which was enhanced by the mint used to flavor the pork. I wonder
how they managed to cook something so large.
Very slowly,commented Saphira, nibbling on her Nagra.
Between bites, Orik explained, “It is custom, from days when poisoning was rampant among clans, for
the host to taste the food first and declare it safe for his guests.”
During the banquet, Eragon divided his time between sampling the multitude of dishes and conversing
with Orik, Arya, and dwarves farther down the table. In that manner, the hours hastened by, for the feast
was so large, it was late afternoon before the last course had been served, the last bite consumed, and
the last chalice drained. As servants removed the tableware, Ûndin turned to Eragon and said, “The meal
pleased you, yes?”
“It was delicious.”
Ûndin nodded. “I’m glad you enjoyed it. I had the tables moved outside yesterday so the dragon might
dine with us.” He remained intently fo-cused on Eragon all the while he spoke.
Eragon went cold inside. Intentionally or not, Ûndin had treated Saphira as no more than a beast.
Eragon had intended to ask about the veiled dwarves in private, but now—out of a desire to unsettle
Ûndin— he said, “Saphira and I thank you.” Then, “Sir, why was the ring thrown at us?”
A painful silence crept over the courtyard. Out of the corner of his eye, Eragon saw Orik wince. Arya,
however, smiled as if she understood what he was doing.
Ûndin put down his dagger, scowling thickly. “The knurlagn you met are of a tragic clan. Before the
Riders’ fall, they were among the oldest, richest families of our kingdom. Their doom was sealed, though,
by two mistakes: they lived on the western edge of the Beor Mountains, and they volunteered their
greatest warriors in Vrael’s service.”
Anger broke through his voice with sharp cracks. “Galbatorix and his ever-cursed Forsworn slaughtered
them in your city of Urû’baen. Then they flew on us, killing many. Of that clan, only Grimstcarvlorss
Anhûin and her guards survived. Anhûin soon died of grief, and her men took the name Az Sweldn rak
Anhûin, The Tears of Anhûin, covering their faces to remind themselves of their loss and their desire for
revenge.”
Eragon’s cheeks stung with shame as he fought to keep his face expres-sionless. “So,” said Ûndin,
glowering at a pastry, “they rebuilt the clan over the decades, waiting and hunting for recompense. And
now you come, bearing Hrothgar’s mark. It is the ultimate insult to them, no matter your service in
Farthen Dûr. Thus the ring, the ultimate challenge. It means Dûrgrimst Az Sweldn rak Anhûin will oppose
you with all their re-sources, in every matter, big or small. They have set themselves against you utterly,
declared themselves blood enemies.”
“Do they mean me bodily harm?” asked Eragon stiffly.
Ûndin’s gaze faltered for a moment as he cast a look at Gannel, then he shook his head and uttered a
gruff laugh that was, perhaps, louder than the occasion warranted. “No, Shadeslayer! Not even they
would dare hurt a guest. It is forbidden. They only want you gone, gone, gone.” Yet Eragon still
wondered. Then Ûndin said, “Please, let us talk no more of these un-pleasant matters. Gannel and I have

Page 380

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

offered our food and mead in friend-ship; is that not what matters?” The priest murmured in
concordance.
“It is appreciated,” Eragon finally relented.
Saphira looked at him with solemn eyes and said, They are afraid, Er-agon. Afraid and resentful
because they have been forced to accept a Rider’s assistance.
Aye. They may fight with us, but they don’t fight for us.
CELBEDEIL

The dawnless morning found Eragon in Ûndin’s main hall, listening as the clan chief spoke to Orik in
Dwarvish. Ûndin broke off as Eragon ap-proached, then said, “Ah, Shadeslayer. You slept well?”
“Yes.”
“Good.” He gestured at Orik. “We have been considering your depar-ture. I had hoped you’d be able
to spend some time with us. But under the circumstances, it seems best if you resume your journey early
tomor-row morning, when few are in the streets who might trouble you. Sup-plies and transportation are
being readied even as I speak. It was Hroth-gar’s orders that guards should accompany you as far as
Ceris. I have in-creased their numbers from three to seven.”
“And in the meantime?”
Ûndin shrugged his fur-bound shoulders. “I had intended to show you the wonders of Tarnag, but it
would be foolish now for you to wander mine city. However, Grimstborith Gannel has invited you to
Celbedeil for the day. Accept if you wish. You’ll be safe with him.” The clan chief seemed to have
forgotten his earlier assertion that Az Sweldn rak Anhûin would not harm a guest.
“Thank you, I might at that.” As Eragon left the hall, he pulled Orik aside and asked, “How serious is
this feud, really? I need to know the truth.”
Orik answered with obvious reluctance: “In the past, it was not un-common for blood feuds to endure
for generations. Entire families were driven extinct because of them. It was rash of Az Sweldn rak Anhûin
to invoke the old ways; such a thing has not been done since the last of the clan wars.... Until they rescind
their oath, you must guard against their treachery, whether it be for a year or a century. I’m sorry that
your friendship with Hrothgar has brought this upon you, Eragon. But you are not alone. Dûrgrimst
Ingeitum stands with you in this.”
Once outside, Eragon hurried to Saphira, who had spent the night coiled in the courtyard. Do you mind
if I visit Celbedeil?
Go if you must. But take Zar’roc.He followed her advice, also tucking Nasuada’s scroll into his tunic.
When Eragon approached the gates to the hall’s enclosure, five dwarves pushed the rough-hewn timbers
aside, then closed in around him, hands on their axes and swords as they inspected the street. The guards
re-mained as Eragon retraced yesterday’s path to the barred entrance of Tar-nag’s foremost tier.

Page 381

Eragon shivered. The city seemed unnaturally empty. Doors were closed, windows were shuttered, and
the few pedestrians in evidence averted their faces and turned down alleys to avoid walking past him.
They’re scared to be seen near me, he realized. Perhaps because they know Az Sweldn rak Anhûin
will retaliate against anyone who helps me. Eager to escape the open street, Eragon raised his hand to
knock, but before he could, one door grated outward, and a black-robed dwarf beckoned from within.
Tightening his sword belt, Eragon entered, leaving his guards out-side.
His first impression was of color. A burning-green sward splayed around the pillared mass of Celbedeil,
like a mantle dropped over the symmetrical hill that upheld the temple. Ivy strangled the building’s
an-cient walls in foot after foot of hairy ropes, dew still glittering on the pointed leaves. And curving
above all but the mountains was the great white cupola ribbed with chiseled gold.
His next impression was of smell. Flowers and incense mixed their per-fumes into an aroma so ethereal,
Eragon felt as if he could live on the scent alone.
Last was sound, for despite clumps of priests strolling along mosaic pathways and spacious grounds, the
only noise Eragon could discern was the soft thump of a rook flying overhead.
The dwarf beckoned again and strode down the main avenue toward Celbedeil. As they passed under
its eaves, Eragon could only marvel at the wealth and craftsmanship displayed around him. The walls
were spotted with gems of every color and cut—though all flawless—and red gold had been hammered
into the veins lacing the stone ceilings, walls, and floor. Pearls and silver provided accents. Occasionally,
they passed a screen partition carved entirely of jade.
The temple was devoid of cloth decorations. In their absence, the dwarves had carved a profusion of
statues, many depicting monsters and deities locked in epic battles.
After climbing several floors, they passed through a copper door waxy with verdigris and embossed with
intricate, patterned knots into a bare room floored with wood. Armor hung thickly on the walls, along
with racks of staff-swords identical to the one Angela had fought with in Far-then Dûr.
Gannel was there, sparring with three younger dwarves. The clan chief’s robe was rucked up over his
thighs so he could move freely, his face a fierce scowl as the wood shaft spun in his hands, unsharpened
blades darting like riled hornets.
Two dwarves lunged at Gannel, only to be stymied in a clatter of wood and metal as he spun past them,
rapping their knees and heads and send-ing them to the floor. Eragon grinned as he watched Gannel
disarm his last opponent in a brilliant flurry of blows.
At last the clan chief noticed Eragon and dismissed the other dwarves. As Gannel set his weapon on a
rack, Eragon said, “Are all Quan so profi-cient with the blade? It seems an odd skill for priests.”
Gannel faced him. “We must be able to defend ourselves, no? Many enemies stalk this land.”
Eragon nodded. “Those are unique swords. I’ve never seen their like, except for one an herbalist used in
the battle of Farthen Dûr.”
The dwarf sucked in his breath, then let it hiss out between his teeth. “Angela.” His expression soured.
“She won her staff from a priest in a game of riddles. It was a nasty trick, as we are the only ones
allowed to use hûthvírn. She and Arya...” He shrugged and went to a small table, where he filled two
mugs with ale. Handing one to Eragon, he said, “I in-vited you here today at Hrothgar’s request. He told

Page 382

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

me that if you ac-cepted his offer to become Ingeitum, I was to acquaint you with dwarf traditions.”
Eragon sipped the ale and kept silent, eyeing how Gannel’s thick brow caught the light, shadows
dripping down his cheeks from the bony ridge.
The clan chief continued: “Never before has an outsider been taught our secret beliefs, nor may you
speak of them to human or elf. Yet with-out this knowledge, you cannot uphold what it means to be
knurla. You are Ingeitum now: our blood, our flesh, our honor. You understand?”
“I do.”
“Come.” Keeping his ale in hand, Gannel took Eragon from the sparring room and conveyed him
through five grand corridors, stopping in the archway to a dim chamber hazy with incense. Facing them,
the squat outline of a statue swelled ponderously from floor to ceiling, a faint light cast across the
brooding dwarf face hacked with uncharacteristic crude-ness from brown granite.
“Who is he?” asked Eragon, intimidated.
“Gûntera, King of the Gods. He is a warrior and a scholar, though fickle in his moods, so we burn
offerings to assure his affection at the solstices, before sowing, and at deaths and births.” Gannel twisted
his hand in a strange gesture and bowed to the statue. “It is to him we pray before bat-tles, for he molded
this land from the bones of a giant and gives the world its order. All realms are Gûntera’s.”
Then Gannel instructed Eragon how to properly venerate the god, ex-plaining the signs and words that
were used for homage. He elucidated the meaning of the incense—how it symbolized life and
happiness—and spent long minutes recounting legends about Gûntera, how the god was born fully
formed to a she-wolf at the dawn of stars, how he had battled monsters and giants to win a place for his
kin in Alagaësia, and how he had taken Kílf, the goddess of rivers and the sea, as his mate.
Next they went to Kílf’s statue, which was carved with exquisite deli-cacy out of pale blue stone. Her
hair flew back in liquid ripples, rolling down her neck and framing merry amethyst eyes. In her hands, she
cupped a water lily and a chunk of porous red rock that Eragon did not recognize.
“What is that?” he asked, pointing.
“Coral taken from deep within the sea that borders the Beors.”
“Coral?”
Gannel took a draught of ale, then said, “Our divers found it while searching for pearls. It seems that, in
brine, certain stones grow like plants.”
Eragon stared with wonder. He had never thought of pebbles or boulders as alive, yet here was proof
that all they needed was water and salt to flourish. It finally explained how rocks had continued to appear
in their fields in Palancar Valley, even after the soil had been combed clean each spring. They grew!
They proceeded to Urûr, master of the air and heavens, and his brother Morgothal, god of fire. At the
carmine statue of Morgothal, the priest told how the brothers loved each other so much, neither could
exist in-dependently. Thus, Morgothal’s burning palace in the sky during the day, and the sparks from his
forge that appeared overhead every night. And also thus, how Urûr constantly fed his sibling so he would
not die.

Page 383

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Only two more gods were left after that: Sindri—mother of the earth— and Helzvog.
Helzvog’s statue was different from the rest. The nude god was bowed in half over a dwarf-sized lump
of gray flint, caressing it with the tip of his forefinger. The muscles of his back bunched and knotted with
inhu-man strain, yet his expression was incredibly tender, as if a newborn child lay before him.
Gannel’s voice dropped to a low rasp: “Gûntera may be King of the Gods, but it is Helzvog who holds
our hearts. It was he who felt that the land should be peopled after the giants were vanquished. The other
gods disagreed, but Helzvog ignored them and, in secret, formed the first dwarf from the roots of a
mountain.
“When his deed was discovered, jealousy swept the gods and Gûntera created elves to control
Alagaësia for himself. Then Sindri brought forth humans from the soil, and Urûr and Morgothal combined
their knowl-edge and released dragons into the land. Only Kílf restrained herself. So the first races
entered this world.”
Eragon absorbed Gannel’s words, accepting the clan chief’s sincerity but unable to quell a simple
question: How does he know? Eragon sensed that it would be an awkward query, however, and merely
nodded as he lis-tened.
“This,” said Gannel, finishing the last of his ale, “leads to our most im-portant rite, which I know Orik has
discussed with you.... All dwarves must be buried in stone, else our spirits will never join Helzvog in his
hall. We are not of earth, air, or fire, but of stone. And as Ingeitum, it is your responsibility to assure a
proper resting place for any dwarf who may die in your company. If you fail—in the absence of injury or
ene-mies—Hrothgar will exile you, and no dwarf will acknowledge your presence until after your death.”
He straightened his shoulders, staring hard at Eragon. “You have much more to learn, yet uphold the
customs I outlined today and you will do well.”
“I won’t forget,” said Eragon.
Satisfied, Gannel led him away from the statues and up a winding stair-case. As they climbed, the clan
chief dipped a hand into his robe and withdrew a simple necklace, a chain threaded through the pommel
of a miniature silver hammer. He gave it to Eragon.
“This is another favor Hrothgar asked of me,” Gannel explained. “He worries that Galbatorix may have
gleaned an image of you from the minds of Durza, the Ra’zac, or any number of soldiers who saw you
throughout the Empire.”
“Why should I fear that?”
“Because then Galbatorix could scry you. Perhaps he already has.”
A shiver of apprehension wormed down Eragon’s side, like an icy snake. I should have thought of
that, he berated himself.
“The necklace will prevent anyone from scrying you or your dragon, as long as you wear it. I placed the
spell myself, so it should hold before even the strongest mind. But be forewarned, when activated, the
neck-lace will draw upon your strength until you either take it off or the dan-ger has passed.”
“What if I’m asleep? Could the necklace consume all my energy before I was aware of it?”

Page 384

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“Nay. It will wake you.”
Eragon rolled the hammer between his fingers. It was difficult to avert another’s spells, least of all
Galbatorix’s. If Gannel is so accomplished, what other enchantments might be hidden in his gift?
He noticed a line of runes cut along the hammer’s haft. They spelled Astim Hefthyn. The stairs ended as
he asked, “Why do dwarves write with the same runes as humans?”
For the first time since they met, Gannel laughed, his voice booming through the temple as his large
shoulders shook. “It is the other way around; humans write with our runes. When your ancestors landed
in Alagaësia, they were as illiterate as rabbits. However, they soon adopted our alphabet and matched it
to this language. Some of your words even come from us, like father, which was originally farthen. ”
“So then Farthen Dûr means... ?” Eragon slipped the necklace over his head and tucked it under his
tunic.
“Our Father.”
Stopping at a door, Gannel ushered Eragon through to a curved gallery located directly below the
cupola. The passageway banded Celbedeil, providing a view through the open archways of the
mountains behind Tarnag, as well as the terraced city far below.
Eragon barely glanced at the landscape, for the gallery’s inner wall was covered with a single continuous
painting, a gigantic narrative band that began with a depiction of the dwarves’ creation under Helzvog’s
hand. The figures and objects stood in relief from the surface, giving the pano-rama a feeling of
hyperrealism with its saturated, glowing colors and minute detail.
Captivated, Eragon asked, “How was this made?”
“Each scene is carved out of small plates of marble, which are fired with enamel, then fitted into a single
piece.”
“Wouldn’t it be easier to use regular paint?”
“It would,” said Gannel, “but not if we wanted it to endure centuries— millennia—without change.
Enamel never fades or loses its brilliancy, unlike oil paint. This first section was carved only a decade
after the dis-covery of Farthen Dûr, well before elves set foot on Alagaësia.”
The priest took Eragon by the arm and guided him along the tableau. Each step carried them through
uncounted years of history.
Eragon saw how the dwarves were once nomads on a seemingly endless plain, until the land grew so hot
and desolate they were forced to migrate south to the Beor Mountains. That was how the Hadarac
Desert was formed, he realized, amazed.
As they proceeded down the mural, heading toward the back of Cel-bedeil, Eragon witnessed
everything from the domestication of Feldûnost to the carving of Isidar Mithrim, the first meeting between
dwarves and elves, and the coronation of each new dwarf king. Dragons frequently ap-peared, burning
and slaughtering. Eragon had difficulty restraining com-ment during those sections.
His steps slowed as the painting shifted to the event he had hoped to find: the war between elves and

Page 385

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

dragons. Here the dwarves had devoted a vast amount of space to the destruction wreaked upon
Alagaësia by the two races. Eragon shuddered with horror at the sight of elves and dragons killing each
other. The battles continued for yards, each image more bloody than the last, until the darkness lifted and
a young elf was shown kneeling on the edge of a cliff, holding a white dragon egg.
“Is that... ?” whispered Eragon.
“Aye, it’s Eragon, the First Rider. It’s a good likeness too, as he agreed to sit for our artisans.”
Drawn forward by his fascination, Eragon studied the face of his name-sake. I always imagined him
older. The elf had angled eyes that peered down a hooked nose and narrow chin, giving him a fierce
appearance. It was an alien face, completely different from his own... and yet the set of his shoulders,
high and tense, reminded Eragon of how he had felt upon finding Saphira’s egg. We’re not so different,
you and I, he thought, touch-ing the cool enamel. And once my ears match yours, we shall truly be
brothers through time.... I wonder, would you approve of my actions? He knew they had made at
least one identical choice; they had both kept the egg.
He heard a door open and close and turned to see Arya approaching from the far end of the gallery. She
scanned the wall with the same blank expression Eragon had seen her use when confronting the Council
of Eld-ers. Whatever her specific emotions, he sensed that she found the situa-tion distasteful.
Arya inclined her head. “Grimstborith.”
“Arya.”
“You have been educating Eragon in your mythology?”
Gannel smiled flatly. “One should always understand the faith of the society that one belongs to.”
“Yet comprehension does not imply belief.” She fingered the pillar of an archway. “Nor does it mean
that those who purvey such beliefs do so for more than... material gain.”
“You would deny the sacrifices my clan makes to bring comfort to our brethren?”
“I deny nothing, only ask what good might be accomplished if your wealth were spread among the
needy, the starving, the homeless, or even to buy supplies for the Varden. Instead, you’ve piled it into a
monument to your own wishful thinking.”
“Enough!” The dwarf clenched his fists, his face mottled. “Without us, the crops would wither in drought.
Rivers and lakes would flood. Our flocks would give birth to one-eyed beasts. The very heavens would
shat-ter under the gods’ rage!” Arya smiled. “Only our prayers and service pre-vent that from
happening. If not for Helzvog, where—”
Eragon soon lost track of the argument. He did not understand Arya’s vague criticisms of Dûrgrimst
Quan, but he gathered from Gannel’s re-sponses that, in some indirect way, she had implied that the
dwarf gods did not exist, questioned the mental capacity of every dwarf who entered a temple, and
pointed out what she took to be flaws in their reasoning— all in a pleasant and polite voice.
After a few minutes, Arya raised her hand, stopping Gannel, and said, “That is the difference between
us, Grimstborith. You devote yourself to that which you believe to be true but cannot prove. There, we
must agree to disagree.” She turned to Eragon then. “Az Sweldn rak Anhûin has inflamed Tarnag’s

Page 386

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

citizens against you. Ûndin believes, as do I, that it would be best for you to remain behind his walls until
we leave.”
Eragon hesitated. He wanted to see more of Celbedeil, but if there was to be trouble, then his place was
by Saphira’s side. He bowed to Gannel and begged to be excused. “You need not apologize,
Shadeslayer,” said the clan chief. He glared at Arya. “Do what you must, and may the blessings of
Gûntera be upon you.”
Together Eragon and Arya departed the temple and, surrounded by a dozen warriors, trotted through
the city. As they did, Eragon heard shouts from an angry mob on a lower tier. A stone skipped over a
nearby roof. The motion drew his eye to a dark plume of smoke rising from the city’s edge.
Once in the hall, Eragon hurried to his room. There he slipped on his mail hauberk; strapped the greaves
to his shins and the bracers to his forearms; jammed the leather cap, coif, and then helm over his head;
and grabbed his shield. Scooping up his pack and saddlebags, he ran back to the courtyard, where he
sat against Saphira’s right foreleg.
Tarnag is like an overturned anthill,she observed.
Let’s hope we don’t get bitten.
Arya joined them before long, as did a group of fifty heavily armed dwarves who settled in the middle of
the courtyard. The dwarves waited impassively, talking in low grunts as they eyed the barred gate and the
mountain that rose up behind them.
“They fear,” said Arya, seating herself by Eragon, “that the crowds may prevent us from reaching the
rafts.”
“Saphira can always fly us out.”
“Snowfire as well? And Ûndin’s guards? No, if we are stopped, we shall have to wait until the dwarves’
outrage subsides.” She studied the darken-ing sky. “It’s unfortunate that you managed to offend so many
dwarves, but perhaps inevitable. The clans have ever been contentious; what pleases one infuriates
another.”
He fingered the edge of his mail. “I wish now I hadn’t accepted Hroth-gar’s offer.”
“Ah, yes. As with Nasuada, I think you made the only viable choice. You are not to blame. The fault, if
any, lies with Hrothgar for making the offer in the first place. He must have been well aware of the
repercus-sions.”
Silence reigned for several minutes. A half-dozen dwarves marched around the courtyard, stretching
their legs. Finally, Eragon asked, “Do you have any family in Du Weldenvarden?”
It was a long time before Arya answered. “None that I’m close to.”
“Why... why is that?”
She hesitated again. “They disliked my choice to become the Queen’s envoy and ambassador; it seemed
inappropriate. When I ignored their objections and still had the yawë tattooed on my shoulder—which
indicates that I have devoted myself to the greater good of our race, as is the case with your ring from

Page 387

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Brom—my family refused to see me again.”
“But that was over seventy years ago,” he protested.
Arya looked away, concealing her face behind a veil of hair. Eragon tried to imagine what it must have
been like for her—ostracized from her family and sent to live among two completely different races. No
wonder she’s so withdrawn, he realized. “Are there any other elves outside of Du Weldenvarden?”
Still keeping her face covered, she said, “Three of us were sent forth from Ellesméra. Fäolin and
Glenwing always traveled with me when we transported Saphira’s egg between Du Weldenvarden and
Tronjheim. Only I survived Durza’s ambush.”
“What were they like?”
“Proud warriors. Glenwing loved speaking to birds with his mind. He would stand in the forest
surrounded by a flock of songbirds and listen to their music for hours. Afterward, he might sing us the
prettiest melodies.”
“And Fäolin?” This time Arya refused to answer, though her hands tightened on her bow. Undaunted,
Eragon cast around for another sub-ject. “Why do you dislike Gannel so much?”
She faced him suddenly and touched his cheek with soft fingers. Eragon flinched with surprise. “That,”
she said, “is a discussion for another time.” Then she stood and calmly relocated herself across the
courtyard.
Confused, Eragon stared at her back. I don’t understand, he said, leaning against Saphira’s belly. She
snorted, amused, then curled her neck and tail around him and promptly fell asleep.
As the valley darkened, Eragon struggled to stay alert. He pulled out Gannel’s necklace and examined it
several times with magic, but found only the priest’s guarding spell. Giving up, he replaced the necklace
under his tunic, pulled his shield over him, and settled down to wait through the night.
At the first hint of light in the sky overhead—though the valley itself was still in shadow and would remain
so until almost midday—Eragon roused Saphira. The dwarves were already up, busy muffling their
weap-ons so they could creep through Tarnag with utter secrecy. Ûndin even had Eragon tie rags around
Saphira’s claws and Snowfire’s hooves.
When all was ready, Ûndin and his warriors assembled in a large block around Eragon, Saphira, and
Arya. The gates were carefully opened—no sound came from the oiled hinges—and then they set out for
the lake.
Tarnag seemed deserted, the vacant streets lined with houses where its inhabitants lay oblivious and
dreaming. The few dwarves they encoun-tered gazed at them silently, then padded away like ghosts in
the twilight.
At the gate to each tier, a guard waved them through without com-ment. They soon left the buildings and
found themselves crossing the barren fields at Tarnag’s base. Beyond those, they reached the stone quay
that edged the still, gray water.
Waiting for them were two wide rafts tied alongside a pier. Three dwarves squatted on the first raft, four
on the second. They stood as Ûndin came into view.

Eragon helped the dwarves hobble and blindfold Snowfire, then coax the reluctant horse onto the
second raft, where he was forced to his knees and tied down. Meanwhile, Saphira slipped off the pier
into the lake. Only her head remained above the surface as she paddled through the water.
Ûndin grasped Eragon’s arm. “Here is where we part. You have my best men; they will protect you until
you reach Du Weldenvarden.” Eragon tried to thank him, but Ûndin shook his head. “No, it is not a
matter for gratitude. It is my duty. I am only shamed that your stay was darkened by the hatred of Az
Sweldn rak Anhûin.”
Eragon bowed, then boarded the first raft with Orik and Arya. The mooring ropes were unknotted, and
the dwarves pushed away from shore with long poles. As dawn approached, the two rafts drifted toward
the mouth of the Az Ragni, Saphira swimming between them.
DIAMONDS IN THE NIGHT

The Empire has violated my home.
So thought Roran as he listened to the anguished moans of the men in-jured during the previous night’s
battle with the Ra’zac and soldiers. Ro-ran shuddered with fear and rage until his whole body was
consumed with feverish chills that left his cheeks burning and his breath short. And he was sad, so very
sad... as if the Ra’zac’s deeds had destroyed the inno-cence of his childhood haunts.
Leaving the healer, Gertrude, tending to the wounded, Roran contin-ued toward Horst’s house, noting
the makeshift barriers that filled the gaps between buildings: the boards, the barrels, the piles of rocks,
and the splintered frames of the two wagons destroyed by the Ra’zac’s explosives. It all seemed pitifully
fragile.
The few people who moved through Carvahall were glassy-eyed with shock, grief, and exhaustion.
Roran was tired too, more than he could ever remember being. He had not slept since the night before
last, and his arms and back ached from the fighting.
He entered Horst’s house and saw Elain standing by the open doorway to the dining room, listening to
the steady burn of conversation that emanated from within. She beckoned him over.
After they had foiled the Ra’zac’s counterattack, the prominent mem-bers of Carvahall had sequestered
themselves in an attempt to decide what action the village should take and if Horst and his allies should be
punished for initiating the hostilities. The group had been in deliberation most of the morning.
Roran peeked into the room. Seated around the long table were Birgit, Loring, Sloan, Gedric, Delwin,
Fisk, Morn, and a number of others. Horst presided at the head of the table.
“... and I say that it was stupid and reckless!” exclaimed Kiselt, propping himself upright on his bony
elbows. “You had no cause to endanger—”
Morn waved a hand. “We’ve been over this before. Whether what has been done should have been
done is beside the point. I happen to agree with it—Quimby was my friend as much as anyone’s, and I
shudder to think what those monsters would do with Roran—but... but what I want to know is how we
can escape this predicament.”

Page 389

“Easy, kill the soldiers,” barked Sloan.
“And then what? More men will follow until we drown in a sea of crimson tunics. Even if we surrender
Roran, it’ll do no good; you heard what the Ra’zac said—they’ll kill us if we protect Roran and enslave
us if we don’t. You may feel differently, but, as for myself, I would rather die than spend my life as a
slave.” Morn shook his head, his mouth set in a flat grim line. “We cannot survive.”
Fisk leaned forward. “We could leave.”
“There’s nowhere to go,” retorted Kiselt. “We’re backed against the Spine, the soldiers have blocked
the road, and beyond them is the rest of the Empire.”
“It’s all your fault,” cried Thane, stabbing a shaking finger at Horst. “They will torch our houses and
murder our children because of you. You!”
Horst stood so quickly, his chair toppled over backward. “Where is your honor, man? Will you let them
eat us without fighting back?”
“ Yes,if it means suicide otherwise.” Thane glared around the table, then stormed out past Roran. His
face was contorted by pure, unadulterated fear.
Gedric spotted Roran then and waved him in. “Come, come, we’ve been waiting for you.”
Roran clasped his hands in the small of his back as scores of hard eyes inspected him. “How can I
help?”
“I think,” said Gedric, “we’ve all agreed that it would accomplish noth-ing to give you to the Empire at
this point. Whether we would if that wasn’t the case is neither here nor there. The only thing we can do is
prepare for another attack. Horst will make spearheads—and other weapons if he has time—and Fisk
has agreed to construct shields. Fortu-nately, his carpentry shop didn’t burn. And someone needs to
oversee our defenses. We would like it to be you. You’ll have plenty of assistance.”
Roran nodded. “I’ll do my best.”
Beside Morn, Tara stood, towering over her husband. She was a large woman, with gray-streaked
black hair and strong hands that were just as capable of twisting off a chicken’s head as separating a pair
of brawlers. She said, “Make sure you do, Roran, else we’ll have more funerals.” Then she turned to
Horst. “Before we go any further, there are men to bury. And there are children who should be sent to
safety, maybe to Cawley’s farm on Nost Creek. You should go as well, Elain.”
“I won’t leave Horst,” said Elain calmly.
Tara bristled. “This is no place for a woman five months pregnant. You’ll lose the child running around
like you have.”
“It would do me far more harm to worry in ignorance than remain here. I have borne my sons; I will
stay, as I know you and every other wife in Carvahall will.”
Horst came around the table and, with a tender expression, took Elain’s hand. “Nor would I have you
anywhere but at my side. The children should go, though. Cawley will care for them well, but we must

Page 390

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

make sure that the route to his farm is clear.”
“Not only that,” rasped Loring, “none of us, not one blasted man jack can have a thing to do with the
families down the valley, ’side from Caw-ley, of course. They can’t help us, and we don’t want those
desecrators to trouble ’em.”
Everyone agreed that he was right, then the meeting ended and the at-tendees dispersed throughout
Carvahall. Before long, however, they re-congregated—along with most of the village—in the small
cemetery be-hind Gertrude’s house. Ten white-swathed corpses were arranged beside their graves, a
sprig of hemlock on each of their cold chests and a silver amulet around each of their necks.
Gertrude stood forth and recited the men’s names: “Parr, Wyglif, Ged, Bardrick, Farold, Hale, Garner,
Kelby, Melkolf, and Albem.” She placed black pebbles over their eyes, then raised her arms, lifted her
face to the sky, and began the quavering death lay. Tears seeped from the corners of her closed eyes as
her voice rose and fell with the immemorial phrases, sighing and moaning with the village’s sorrow. She
sang of the earth and the night and of humanity’s ageless sorrow from which none escape.
After the last mournful note faded into silence, family members praised the feats and traits of those they
had lost. Then the bodies were buried.
As Roran listened, his gaze lit upon the anonymous mound where the three soldiers had been interred.
One killed by Nolfavrell, and two by me. He could still feel the visceral shock of muscle and bone
giving... crunch-ing... pulping under his hammer. His bile rose and he had to struggle not to be sick in full
view of the village. I am the one who destroyed them. Ro-ran had never expected or wanted to kill,
and yet he had taken more lives than anyone else in Carvahall. It felt as if his brow was marked with
blood.
He left as soon as possible—not even stopping to speak with Katrina— and climbed to a point where
he could survey Carvahall and consider how best to protect it. Unfortunately, the houses were too far
apart to form a defensive perimeter by just fortifying the spaces between build-ings. Nor did Roran think
it would be a good idea to have soldiers fight-ing up against the walls of people’s houses and trampling
their gardens. The Anora River guards our western flank, he thought, but as for the rest of
Carvahall, we couldn’t even keep a child out of it.... What can we build in a few hours that will be
a strong enough barrier?
He jogged into the middle of the village and shouted, “I need everyone who is free to help cut down
trees!” After a minute, men began to trickle out of the houses and through the streets. “Come on, more!
We all have to help!” Roran waited as the group around him continued to grow.
One of Loring’s sons, Darmmen, shouldered to his side. “What’s your plan?”
Roran raised his voice so they could all hear. “We need a wall around Carvahall; the thicker the better. I
figure if we get some big trees, lay them on their sides, and sharpen the branches, the Ra’zac will have a
pretty hard time getting over them.”
“How many trees do you think it’ll take?” asked Orval.
Roran hesitated, trying to gauge Carvahall’s circumference. “At least fifty. Maybe sixty to do it
properly.” The men swore and began to argue. “Wait!” Roran counted the number of people in the
crowd. He arrived at forty-eight. “If you each fell a tree in the next hour, we’ll be almost done. Can you
do that?”

Page 391

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“What do you take us for?” retorted Orval. “The last time I took an hour on a tree, I was ten!”
Darmmen spoke up: “What about brambles? We could drape them over the trees. I don’t know anyone
who can climb through a knot of thorny vines.”
Roran grinned. “That’s a great idea. Also, those of you with sons, have them harness your horses so we
can drag the trees back.” The men agreed and scattered through Carvahall to gather axes and saws for
the job. Ro-ran stopped Darmmen and said, “Make sure that the trees have branches all along the trunk
or else they won’t work.”
“Where will you be?” asked Darmmen.
“Working on another line of defense.” Roran left him then and ran to Quimby’s house, where he found
Birgit busy boarding up the windows.
“Yes?” she said, looking at him.
He quickly explained his plan with the trees. “I want to dig a trench in-side the ring of trees, to slow
down anyone who gets through. We could even put pointed stakes in the bottom of it and—”
“What is your point, Roran?”
“I’d like you to organize every woman and child, and everyone else you can, to dig. It’s too much for
me to handle by myself, and we don’t have long....” Roran looked her straight in the eyes. “Please.”
Birgit frowned. “Why ask me?”
“Because, like me, you hate the Ra’zac, and I know you will do every-thing possible to stop them.”
“Aye,” whispered Birgit, then clapped her hands briskly. “Very well, as you wish. But I will never forget,
Roran Garrowsson, that it was you and your family who brought about my husband’s doom.” She strode
away before Roran could respond.
He accepted her animosity with equanimity; it was to be expected, considering her loss. He was only
lucky she had not started a blood feud. Then he shook himself and ran to where the main road entered
Carva-hall. It was the weakest spot in the village and had to be doubly pro-tected. The Ra’zac can’t be
allowed to just blast their way in again.
Roran recruited Baldor, and together they began excavating a ditch across the road. “I’ll have to go
soon,” warned Baldor between strokes of his pickax. “Dad needs me in the forge.”
Roran grunted an acknowledgment without looking up. As he worked, his mind once again filled with
memories of the soldiers: how they had looked as he struck them, and the feeling, the horrible feeling of
smashing a body as if it were a rotten stump. He paused, nauseated, and noted the commotion
throughout Carvahall as people readied themselves for the next assault.
After Baldor left, Roran completed the thigh-deep ditch himself, then went to Fisk’s workshop. With the
carpenter’s permission, he had five logs from the stockpile of seasoned wood pulled by horses back to
the main road. There Roran tipped the logs on end into the trench so that they formed an impenetrable
barrier into Carvahall.

Page 392

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

As he tamped down the earth around the logs, Darmmen trotted up. “We got the trees. They’re just
being put into place now.” Roran accom-panied him to Carvahall’s northern edge, where twelve men
wrestled four lush green pines into alignment while a team of draft horses under the whip of a young boy
returned to the foothills. “Most of us are helping to retrieve the trees. The others got inspired; they
seemed determined to chop down the rest of the forest when I left.”
“Good, we can use the extra timber.”
Darmmen pointed to a pile of dense brambles that sat on the edge of Kiselt’s fields. “I cut those along
the Anora. Use them however you want. I’m going to find more.”
Roran clapped him on the arm, then turned toward the eastern side of Carvahall, where a long, curved
line of women, children, and men la-bored in the dirt. He went to them and found Birgit issuing orders
like a general and distributing water among the diggers. The trench was already five feet wide and two
feet deep. When Birgit paused for breath, he said, “I’m impressed.”
She brushed back a lock of hair without looking at him. “We plowed the ground to begin with. It made
things easier.”
“Do you have a shovel I can use?” he asked. Birgit pointed to a mound of tools at the other end of the
trench. As Roran walked toward it, he spied the copper gleam of Katrina’s hair in the midst of the
bobbing backs. Beside her, Sloan hacked at the soft loam with a furious, obsessive energy, as if he were
attempting to tear open the earth’s skin, to peel back its clay hide and expose the muscle beneath. His
eyes were wild, and his teeth were bared in a knotted grimace, despite the flecks of dirt and filth that
spotted his lips.
Roran shuddered at Sloan’s expression and hurried past, averting his face so as to avoid meeting his
bloodshot gaze. He grabbed a shovel and immediately plunged it into the soil, doing his best to forget his
worries in the heat of physical exertion.
The day progressed in a continuous rush of activity, without breaks for meals or rest. The trench grew
longer and deeper, until it cupped two-thirds of the village and reached the banks of the Anora River. All
the loose dirt was piled on the inside edge of the trench in an attempt to prevent anyone from jumping
over it... and to make it difficult to climb out.
The wall of trees was finished in early afternoon. Roran stopped digging then to help sharpen the
innumerable branches—which were overlapped and interlocked as much as possible—and affix the nets
of brambles. Oc-casionally, they had to pull out a tree so farmers like Ivor could drive their livestock into
the safety of Carvahall.
By evening the fortifications were stronger and more extensive than Roran had dared hope, though they
still required several more hours of work to complete to his satisfaction.
He sat on the ground, gnawing a hunk of sourdough bread and staring at the stars through a haze of
exhaustion. A hand dropped on his shoul-der, and he looked up to see Albriech. “Here.” Albriech
extended a rough shield—made of sawed boards pegged together—and a six-foot-long spear. Roran
accepted them gratefully, then Albriech proceeded onward, distributing spears and shields to whomever
he encountered.
Roran dragged himself upright, got his hammer from Horst’s house, and thus armed, went to the

Page 393

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

entrance to the main road, where Baldor and two others kept watch. “Wake me when you need to rest,”
Roran said, then lay on the soft grass underneath the eaves of a nearby house. He ar-ranged his weapons
so he could find them in the dark and closed his eyes in eager anticipation.
“Roran.”
The whisper came from by his right ear. “Katrina?” He struggled into a sitting position, blinking as she
unshuttered a lantern so a key of light struck his thigh. “What are you doing here?”
“I wanted to see you.” Her eyes, large and mysterious against her pale face, pooled with the night’s
shadows. She took his arm and led him to a deserted porch far out of earshot of Baldor and the other
guards. There she placed her hands on his cheeks and softly kissed him, but he was too tired and
troubled to respond to her affection. She drew away and stud-ied him. “What is wrong, Roran?”
A bark of humorless laughter escaped him. “What’s wrong? The world is wrong; it’s as askew as a
picture frame knocked on its side.” He jammed his fist against his gut. “And I am wrong. Every time I
allow my-self to relax, I see the soldiers bleeding under my hammer. Men I killed, Katrina. And their
eyes... their eyes ! They knew they were about to die and that they could nothing do about it.” He
trembled in the darkness. “They knew... I knew... and I still had to do it. It couldn’t—” Words failed him
as he felt hot tears roll down his cheeks.
Katrina cradled his head as Roran cried from the shock of the past few days. He wept for Garrow and
Eragon; he wept for Parr, Quimby, and the other dead; he wept for himself; and he wept for the fate of
Carva-hall. He sobbed until his emotions ebbed and left him as dry and hollow as an old barley husk.
Forcing himself to take a long breath, Roran looked at Katrina and no-ticed her own tears. He brushed
them away with his thumb, like dia-monds in the night. “Katrina... my love.” He said it again, tasting the
words: “My love. I have naught to give you but my love. Still... I must ask. Will you marry me?”
In the dim lantern light, he saw pure joy and wonder leap across her face. Then she hesitated and
troubled doubt appeared. It was wrong for him to ask, or for her to accept, without Sloan’s permission.
But Roran no longer cared; he had to know now if he and Katrina would spend their lives together.
Then, softly: “Yes, Roran, I will.”
UNDER A DARKLING SKY

That night it rained.
Layer upon layer of pregnant clouds blanketed Palancar Valley, clinging to the mountains with tenacious
arms and filling the air with heavy, cold mist. From inside, Roran watched as cords of gray water pelted
the trees with their frothing leaves, muddied the trench around Carvahall, and scrabbled with blunt fingers
against the thatched roofs and eaves as the clouds disgorged their load. Everything was streaked,
blurred, and hidden behind the torrent’s inexorable streamers.
By midmorning the storm had abated, although a continuous drizzle still percolated through the mist. It
quickly soaked Roran’s hair and clothes when he took his watch at the barricade to the main road. He
squatted by the upright logs, shook his cloak, then pulled the hood far-ther over his face and tried to
ignore the cold.

Page 394

Despite the weather, Roran soared and exulted with his joy at Katrina’s acceptance. They were
engaged! In his mind, it was as if a missing piece of the world had dropped into place, as if he had been
granted the confi-dence of an invulnerable warrior. What did the soldiers matter, or the Ra’zac, or the
Empire itself, before love such as theirs? They were noth-ing but tinder to the blaze.
For all his new bliss, however, his mind was entirely focused on what had become the most important
conundrum of his existence: how to as-sure that Katrina would survive Galbatorix’s wrath. He had
thought of nothing else since waking. The best thing would be for Katrina to go to Cawley’s, he
decided, staring down the hazy road, but she would never agree to leave... unless Sloan told her to. I
might be able to convince him; I’m sure he wants her out of danger as much as I do.
As he considered ways to approach the butcher, the clouds thickened again and the rain renewed its
assault on the village, arching down in stinging waves. Around Roran, the puddles jumped to life as
pellets of water drummed their surfaces, bouncing back up like startled grasshop-pers.
When Roran grew hungry, he passed his watch to Larne—Loring’s youngest son—and went to find
lunch, darting from the shelter of one eave to another. As he rounded a corner, he was surprised to see
Albriech on the house’s porch, arguing violently with a group of men.
Ridley shouted, “... you’re blind—follow the cottonwoods and they’ll never see! You took the
addle-brain’s route.”
“Try it if you want,” retorted Albriech.
“I will!”
“Then you can tell me how you like the taste of arrows.”
“Maybe,” said Thane, “we aren’t as clubfooted as you are.”
Albriech turned on him with a snarl. “Your words are as thick as your wits. I’m not stupid enough to risk
my family on the cover of a few leaves that I’ve never seen before.” Thane’s eyes bulged and his face
turned a deep mottled crimson. “What?” taunted Albriech. “Have you no tongue?”
Thane roared and struck Albriech on the cheek with his fist. Albriech laughed. “Your arm is as weak as
a woman’s.” Then he grabbed Thane’s shoulder and threw him off the porch and into the mud, where he
lay on his side, stunned.
Holding his spear like a staff, Roran jumped beside Albriech, prevent-ing Ridley and the others from
laying hands on him. “No more,” growled Roran, furious. “We have other enemies. An assembly can be
called and arbitrators will decide whether compensation is due to either Albriech or Thane. But until then,
we can’t fight ourselves.”
“Easy for you to say,” spat Ridley. “You have no wife or children.” Then he helped Thane to his feet and
departed with the group of men.
Roran stared hard at Albriech and the purple bruise that was spreading beneath his right eye. “What
started it?” he asked.
“I—” Albriech stopped with a grimace and felt his jaw. “I went scouting with Darmmen. The Ra’zac

Page 395

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

have posted soldiers on several hills. They can see across the Anora and up and down the valley. One or
two of us might, might, be able to creep past them without notice, but we’ll never get the children to
Cawley without killing the soldiers, and then we might as well tell the Ra’zac where we’re going.”
Dread clutched at Roran, flooding like poison through his heart and veins. What can I do? Sick with a
sense of impending doom, he put an arm around Albriech’s shoulders. “Come on; Gertrude should have
a look at you.”
“No,” said Albriech, shrugging him off. “She has more pressing cases than me.” He took a preparatory
breath—as if he were about to dive into a lake—and lumbered off through the downpour in the direction
of the forge.
Roran watched him go, then shook his head and went inside. He found Elain sitting on the floor with a
row of children, sharpening a pile of spearheads with files and whetstones. Roran gestured to Elain. Once
they were in another room, he told her what had just occurred.
Elain swore harshly—startling him, for he had never heard her use such language—then asked, “Is there
cause for Thane to declare a feud?”
“Possibly,” admitted Roran. “They both insulted each other, but Al-briech’s oaths were the strongest....
However, Thane did strike first. You could declare a feud yourself.”
“Nonsense,” asserted Elain, wrapping a shawl around her shoulders. “This is a dispute for arbitrators to
resolve. If we must pay a fine, so be it, as long as bloodshed is avoided.” She headed out the front door,
a finished spear in hand.
Troubled, Roran located bread and meat in the kitchen, then helped the children sharpen spearheads.
Once Felda, one of the mothers, arrived, Roran left the children in her care and slogged back through
Carvahall to the main road.
As he squatted in the mud, a shaft of sunlight burst underneath the clouds and illuminated the folds of rain
so each drop flashed with crystal-line fire. Roran stared, awestruck, ignoring the water streaming down
his face. The rift in the clouds widened until a shelf of massive thunderheads hung over the western
three-quarters of Palancar Valley, facing a strip of pure blue sky. Because of the billowy roof above and
the angle of the sun, the rain-drenched landscape was lit brilliantly on one side and painted with rich
shadows on the other, giving the fields, bushes, trees, river, and mountains the most extraordinary colors.
It was as if the entire world had been transformed into a sculpture of burnished metal.
Just then, movement caught Roran’s eye, and he looked down to see a soldier standing on the road, his
mail shining like ice. The man gaped with amazement at Carvahall’s new fortifications, then turned and
fled back into the golden mist.
“Soldiers!” shouted Roran, jolting to his feet. He wished that he had his bow, but he had left it inside to
protect it from the elements. His only comfort was that the soldiers would have an even harder time
keeping their weapons dry.
Men and women ran from their houses, gathered along the trench, and peered out through the wall of
overlapping pines. The long branches wept beads of moisture, translucent cabochons that reflected the
rows of anxious eyes.
Roran found himself standing beside Sloan. The butcher held one of Fisk’s makeshift shields in his left

Page 396

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

hand, and in his right a cleaver curved like a half-moon. His belt was festooned with at least a dozen
knives, all of them large and honed to a razor edge. He and Roran exchanged brisk nods, then refocused
on where the soldier had disappeared.
Less than a minute later, the disembodied voice of a Ra’zac slithered out of the mist: “By continuing to
defend Carvahall, you proclaim your choice and ssseal your doom. You ssshall die!”
Loring responded: “Show your maggot-riddled faces if you dare, you lily-livered, bandy-legged,
snake-eyed wretches ! We’ll crack your skulls open and fatten our hogs on your blood!”
A dark shape floated toward them, followed by the dull thump of a spear embedding itself in a door an
inch from Gedric’s left arm.
“Take cover!” shouted Horst from the middle of the line. Roran knelt behind his shield and peered
through a hairline gap between two of the boards. He was just in time, for a half-dozen spears hurtled
over the wall of trees and buried themselves among the cowering villagers.
From somewhere in the mist came an agonized scream.
Roran’s heart jumped with a painful flutter. He panted for breath, though he had not moved, and his
hands were slick with sweat. He heard the faint sound of shattering glass on the northern edge of
Carvahall... then the bellow of an explosion and crashing timbers.
Spinning around, he and Sloan sped through Carvahall, where they found a team of six soldiers dragging
away the splintered remains of sev-eral trees. Beyond them, pale and wraithlike in the glittering shards of
rain, sat the Ra’zac on their black horses. Without slowing, Roran fell upon the first man, jabbing his
spear. His first and second stabs were de-flected by an upraised arm, then Roran caught the soldier on
the hip, and when he stumbled, in his throat.
Sloan howled like an enraged beast, threw his cleaver, and split one of the men’s helms, crushing his
skull. Two soldiers charged him with drawn swords. Sloan sidestepped, laughing now, and blocked their
attacks with his shield. One soldier swung so hard, his blade stuck in the shield’s rim. Sloan yanked him
closer and gored him through the eye with a carv-ing knife from his belt. Drawing a second cleaver, the
butcher circled his other opponent with a maniacal grin. “Shall I gut and hamstring you?” he demanded,
almost prancing with a terrible, bloody glee.
Roran lost his spear to the next two men he faced. He barely managed to drag out his hammer in time to
stop a sword from shearing off his leg. The soldier who had torn the spear from Roran’s grip now cast
the weapon at him, aiming for his breast. Roran dropped his hammer, caught the shaft in midair—which
astounded him as much as the soldiers—spun it around, and drove the spear through the armor and ribs
of the man who had launched it. Left weaponless, Roran was forced to retreat before the remaining
soldier. He stumbled over a corpse, cutting his calf on a sword as he fell, and rolled to avoid a
two-handed blow from the soldier, scrabbling frantically in the ankle-deep mud for something, anything
he could use for a weapon. A hilt bruised his fingers, and he ripped it from the muck and slashed at the
soldier’s sword hand, severing his thumb.
The man stared dumbly at the glistening stump, then said, “This is what comes from not shielding myself.”
“Aye,” agreed Roran, and beheaded him.
The last soldier panicked and fled toward the impassive specters of the Ra’zac while Sloan bombarded

Page 397

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

him with a stream of insults and foul names. When the soldier finally pierced the shining curtain of rain,
Roran watched with a thrill of horror as the two black figures bent down from their steeds on either side
of the man and gripped the nape of his neck with twisted hands. The cruel fingers tightened, and the man
shrieked desperately and convulsed, then went limp. The Ra’zac placed the corpse behind one of their
saddles before turning their horses and riding away.
Roran shuddered and looked at Sloan, who was cleaning his blades. “You fought well.” He had never
suspected that the butcher contained such ferocity.
Sloan said in a low voice, “They’ll never get Katrina. Never, even if I must skin the lot of them, or fight a
thousand Urgals and the king to boot. I’d tear the sky itself down and let the Empire drown in its own
blood before she suffers so much as a scratch.” He clamped his mouth shut then, jammed the last of his
knives into his belt, and began dragging the three broken trees back into position.
While he did, Roran rolled the dead soldiers through the trampled mud, away from the fortifications.
Now I have killed five. At the comple-tion of his labor, he straightened and glanced around, puzzled, for
all he heard was silence and the hissing rain. Why has no one come to help us?
Wondering what else might have occurred, he returned with Sloan to the scene of the first attack. Two
soldiers hung lifelessly on the slick branches of the tree wall, but that was not what held their attention.
Horst and the other villagers knelt in a circle around a small body. Roran caught his breath. It was
Elmund, son of Delwin. The ten-year-old boy had been struck in his side by a spear. His parents sat in
the mud beside him, their faces as blank as stone.
Something has to be done,thought Roran, dropping to his knees and leaning against his spear. Few
children survived their first five or six years. But to lose your firstborn son now, when everything
indicated that he should grow tall and strong to take his father’s place in Carvahall—it was enough to
crush you. Katrina... the children... they all have to be protected.
But where?... Where?... Where?... Where!
DOWN THE RUSHING MERE-WASH

On the first day from Tarnag, Eragon made an effort to learn the names of Ûndin’s guards. They were
Ama, Tríhga, Hedin, Ekksvar, Shrrgnien— which Eragon found unpronounceable, though he was told it
meant Wolfheart—Dûthmér, and Thorv.
Each raft had a small cabin in the center. Eragon preferred to spend his time seated on the edge of the
logs, watching the Beor Mountains scroll by. Kingfishers and jackdaws flitted along the clear river, while
blue her-ons stood stiltlike on the marshy bank, which was planked with splotches of light that fell
through the boughs of hazel, beech, and willow. Occa-sionally, a bullfrog would croak from a bed of
ferns.
When Orik settled beside him, Eragon said, “It’s beautiful.”
“That it is.” The dwarf quietly lit his pipe, then leaned back and puffed.
Eragon listened to the creak of wood and rope as Tríhga steered the raft with the long paddle at the aft.
“Orik, can you tell me why Brom joined the Varden? I know so little about him. For most of my life, he

was just the town storyteller.”
“He never joined the Varden; he helped found it.” Orik paused to tap some ashes into the water. “After
Galbatorix became king, Brom was the only Rider still alive, outside of the Forsworn.”
“But he wasn’t a Rider, not then. His dragon was killed in the fighting at Doru Araeba.”
“Well, a Rider by training. Brom was the first to organize the friends and allies of the Riders who had
been forced into exile. It was he who convinced Hrothgar to allow the Varden to live in Farthen Dûr, and
he who obtained the elves’ assistance.”
They were silent for a while. “Why did Brom relinquish the leader-ship?” asked Eragon.
Orik smiled wryly. “Perhaps he never wanted it. It was before Hrothgar adopted me, so I saw little of
Brom in Tronjheim.... He was always off fighting the Forsworn or engaged in one plot or another.”
“Your parents are dead?”
“Aye. The pox took them when I was young, and Hrothgar was kind enough to welcome me into his hall
and, since he has no children of his own, to make me his heir.”
Eragon thought of his helm, marked with the Ingeitum symbol. Hroth-gar has been kind to me as well.
When the afternoon twilight arrived, the dwarves hung a round lantern at each corner of the rafts. The
lanterns were red, which Eragon remem-bered was to preserve night vision. He stood by Arya and
studied the lan-terns’ pure, motionless depths. “Do you know how these are made?” he asked.
“It was a spell we gave the dwarves long ago. They use it with great skill.”
Eragon reached up and scratched his chin and cheeks, feeling the patches of stubble that had begun to
appear. “Could you teach me more magic while we travel?”
She looked at him, her balance perfect on the undulating logs. “It is not my place. A teacher is waiting
for you.”
“Then tell me this, at least,” he said. “What does the name of my sword mean?”
Arya’s voice was very soft. “ Miseryis your sword. And so it was until you wielded it.”
Eragon stared with aversion at Zar’roc. The more he learned about his weapon, the more malevolent it
seemed, as if the blade could cause mis-fortune of its own free will. Not only did Morzan kill Riders
with it, but Zar’roc’s very name is evil. If Brom had not given it to him, and if not for the fact that
Zar’roc never dulled and could not be broken, Eragon would have thrown it into the river at that very
moment.
Before it grew any darker, Eragon swam out to Saphira. They flew to-gether for the first time since
leaving Tronjheim and soared high above the Az Ragni, where the air was thin and the water below was
only a purple streak.
Without the saddle, Eragon gripped Saphira tightly with his knees, feel-ing her hard scales rub the scars
from their first flight.

Page 399

As Saphira tilted to the left, rising on an updraft, he saw three brown specks launch themselves from the
mountainside below and ascend rap-idly. At first Eragon took them to be falcons, but as they neared, he
real-ized that the animals were almost twenty feet long, with attenuated tails and leathery wings. In fact,
they looked like dragons, though their bodies were smaller, thinner, and more serpentine than Saphira’s.
Nor did their scales glitter, but were dappled green and brown.
Excited, Eragon pointed them out to Saphira. Could they be dragons? he asked.
I don’t know.She floated in place, inspecting the newcomers as they spiraled around them. The
creatures seemed puzzled by Saphira. They darted toward her, only to hiss and swoop overhead at the
last moment.
Eragon grinned and reached out with his mind, trying to touch their thoughts. As he did, the three
recoiled and shrieked, opening their maws like hungry snakes. Their piercing keen was mental as well as
physical. It tore through Eragon with a savage strength, seeking to incapacitate him. Saphira felt it too.
Continuing the racking cry, the creatures attacked with razor claws.
Hold on,warned Saphira. She folded her left wing and spun halfway around, avoiding two of the animals,
then flapped quickly, rising above the other. At the same time, Eragon worked furiously to block the
shriek. The instant his mind was clear, he reached for the magic. Don’t kill them, said Saphira. I want
the experience.
Though the creatures were more agile than Saphira, she had the advan-tage of bulk and strength. One of
the creatures dove at her. She flipped upside down—falling backward—and kicked the animal in the
chest.
The shriek dropped in intensity as her injured foe retreated.
Saphira flared her wings, looping right side up so she faced the other two as they converged on her. She
arched her neck, Eragon heard a deep rumble between her ribs, and then a jet of flame roared from her
jaws. A molten-blue halo engulfed Saphira’s head, flashing through her gemlike scales until she sparkled
gloriously and seemed to be lit from within.
The two dragon-beasts squawked in dismay and veered to either side. The mental assault ceased as
they sped away, sinking back toward the mountainside.
You almost threw me off,said Eragon, loosening his cramped arms from around her neck.
She looked at him smugly. Almost, but not quite.
That’s true,he laughed.
Flushed with the thrill of victory, they returned to the rafts. As Saphira landed amid two great fins of
water, Orik shouted, “Are you hurt?”
“No,” called Eragon. The icy water whirled around his legs as Saphira swam to the side of the raft.
“Were they another race unique to the Beors?”
Orik pulled him onto the raft. “We call them Fanghur. They’re not as intelligent as dragons and they
can’t breathe fire, but they are still formi-dable foes.”

Page 400

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“So we discovered.” Eragon massaged his temples in an attempt to alle-viate the headache the
Fanghur’s attack had brought on. “Saphira was more than a match for them, however.”
Of course,she said.
“It’s how they hunt,” explained Orik. “They use their minds to immobi-lize their prey while they kill it.”
Saphira flicked water at Eragon with her tail. It’s a good idea. Maybe I’ll try it next time I go
hunting.
He nodded. It could come in handy in a fight too.
Arya came to the edge of the raft. “I’m glad you did not kill them. Fanghur are rare enough that those
three would have been sorely missed.”
“They still manage to eat enough of our herds,” growled Thorv from in-side the cabin. The dwarf
marched out to Eragon, champing irritably un-der the twisted knots of his beard. “Do not fly anymore
while in these Beor Mountains, Shadeslayer. It is difficult enough to keep you unharmed without you and
thine dragon fighting wind-vipers.”
“We’ll stay on the ground until we reach the plains,” promised Eragon.
“Good.”
When they stopped for the night, the dwarves moored the rafts to as-pen trees along the mouth of a
small stream. Ama started a fire while Er-agon helped Ekksvar pull Snowfire onto land. They picketed
the stallion on a strip of grass.
Thorv oversaw the erection of six large tents. Hedin gathered firewood to last until morning, and
Dûthmér carried supplies off the second raft and began making dinner. Arya took up watch on the edge
of camp, where she was soon joined by Ekksvar, Ama, and Tríhga when they fin-ished their tasks.
When Eragon realized he had nothing to do, he squatted by the fire with Orik and Shrrgnien. As
Shrrgnien pulled off his gloves and held his scarred hands over the flames, Eragon noticed that a polished
steel stud— perhaps a quarter of an inch long—protruded from each of the dwarf’s knuckles, except for
on his thumbs.
“What are those?” he asked.
Shrrgnien looked at Orik and laughed. “These are mine Ascûdgamln... mine ‘fists of steel.’ ” Without
standing, he twisted and punched the bole of an aspen, leaving four symmetrical holes in the bark.
Shrrgnien laughed again. “They are good for hitting things, eh?”
Eragon’s curiosity and envy were aroused. “How are they made? I mean, how are the spikes attached
to your hands?”
Shrrgnien hesitated, trying to find the right words. “A healer puts you in a deep sleep, so you feel no
pain. Then a hole is—is drilled, yes?—is drilled down through the joints...” He broke off and spoke
quickly to Orik in the dwarf language.

Page 401

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“A metal socket is embedded in each hole,” explained Orik. “Magic is used to seal it in place, and when
the warrior has fully recovered, various-sized spikes can be threaded into the sockets.”
“Yes, see,” said Shrrgnien, grinning. He gripped the stud above his left index finger, carefully twisted it
free of his knuckle, and then handed it to Eragon.
Eragon smiled as he rolled the sharp lump around his palm. “I wouldn’t mind having ‘fists of steel’
myself.” He returned the stud to Shrrgnien.
“It’s a dangerous operation,” warned Orik. “Few knurlan get Ascûdgamln because you can easily lose
the use of your hands if the drill goes too deep.” He raised his fist and showed it to Eragon. “Our bones
are thicker than yours. It might not work for a human.”
“I’ll remember that.” Still, Eragon could not help but imagine what it would be like to fight with
Ascûdgamln, to be able to strike anything he wanted with impunity, including armored Urgals. He loved
the idea.
After eating, Eragon retired to his tent. The fire provided enough light that he could see the silhouette of
Saphira nestled alongside the tent, like a figure cut from black paper and pasted against the canvas wall.
Eragon sat with the blankets pulled over his legs and stared at his lap, drowsy but unwilling to sleep quite
yet. Unbidden, his mind turned to thoughts of home. He wondered how Roran, Horst, and everyone else
from Carvahall was doing, and if the weather in Palancar Valley was warm enough for the farmers to
start planting their crops. Longing and sadness suddenly gripped Eragon.
He removed a wood bowl from his pack and, taking his waterskin, filled it to the brim with liquid. Then
he focused on an image of Roran and whispered, “Draumr kópa.”
As always, the water went black before brightening to reveal the object being scryed. Eragon saw
Roran sitting alone in a candlelit bedroom he recognized from Horst’s house. Roran must have given up
his job in Ther-insford, realized Eragon. His cousin leaned on his knees and clasped his hands, staring
at the far wall with an expression that Eragon knew meant Roran was grappling with some difficult
problem. Still, Roran seemed well enough, if a bit drawn, which comforted Eragon. After a minute, he
released the magic, ending the spell and clearing the surface of the water.
Reassured, Eragon emptied the bowl, then lay down, pulling the blan-kets up to his chin. He closed his
eyes and sank into the warm dusk that separates consciousness and sleep, where reality bends and
sways to the wind of thought, and where creativity blossoms in its freedom from boundaries and all things
are possible.
Slumber soon took him. Most of his rest was uneventful, but right be-fore he woke, the usual night
phantasms were replaced with a vision as clear and vibrant as any waking experience.
He saw a tortured sky, black and crimson with smoke. Crows and eagles swirled high above flights of
arrows that arched from one side to another of a great battle. A man sprawled in the clotted mud with a
dented helm and bloody mail—his face concealed behind an upthrown arm.
An armored hand entered Eragon’s view. The gauntlet was so near it blot-ted out half the world with
polished steel. Like an inexorable machine, the thumb and last three fingers curled into a fist, leaving the
trunk of the index finger to point at the downed man with all the authority of fate itself.

The vision still filled Eragon’s mind when he crawled out of the tent. He found Saphira some distance
from the camp, gnawing on a furry lump. When he told her what he had seen, she paused in midbite, then
jerked her neck and swallowed a strip of meat.
The last time this occurred,she said, it proved to be a true prediction of events elsewhere. Do you
think a battle is in progress in Alagaësia?
He kicked a loose branch. I’m not sure.... Brom said you could only scry people, places, and things
that you had already seen. Yet I’ve never seen this place. Nor had I seen Arya when I first dreamt
about her in Teirm.
Perhaps Togira Ikonoka will be able to explain it.
As they prepared to leave, the dwarves seemed much more relaxed now that they were a good distance
from Tarnag. When they started pol-ing down the Az Ragni, Ekksvar—who was steering Snowfire’s
raft— began chanting in his rough bass:
Down the rushing mere-wash
Of Kílf’s welling blood,
We ride the twisting timbers,
For hearth, clan, and honor.
Under the ernes’ sky-vat, Through the ice-wolves’ forest bowls,
We ride the gory wood,
For iron, gold, and diamond.
Let hand-ringer and bearded gaper fill my grip
And battle-leaf guard my stone
As I leave the halls of my fathers
For the empty land beyond.
The other dwarves joined Ekksvar, slipping into Dwarvish as they con-tinued on to other verses. The
low throb of their voices accompanied Er-agon as he carefully made his way to the head of the raft,
where Arya sat cross-legged.
“I had a... vision during my sleep,” said Eragon. Arya looked at him with interest, and he recounted the
images he had seen. “If it’s scrying, then—”
“It’s not scrying,” said Arya. She spoke with deliberate slowness, as if to prevent any misunderstanding.
“I thought for a long time about how you saw me imprisoned in Gil’ead, and I believe that as I lay
unconscious, my spirit was searching for help, wherever I might find it.”
“But why me?”

Page 403

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Arya nodded toward where Saphira undulated through the water. “I grew accustomed to Saphira’s
presence during the fifteen years I guarded her egg. I was reaching out for anything that felt familiar when
I touched your dreams.”
“Are you really strong enough to contact someone in Teirm from Gil’ead? Especially if you were
drugged.”
A ghost of a smile touched Arya’s lips. “I could stand on the very gates of Vroengard and still speak
with you as clearly as I am now.” She paused. “If you did not scry me in Teirm, then you could not have
scryed this new dream. It must be a premonition. They have been known to occur throughout the sentient
races, but especially among magic users.”
Eragon clutched the netting around a bundle of supplies as the raft lurched. “If what I saw will come to
pass, then how can we change any-thing that happens? Do our choices matter? What if I threw myself off
the raft right now and drowned?”
“But you won’t.” Arya dipped her left forefinger in the river and stared at the single drop that clung to
her skin, like a quivering lens. “Once, long ago, the elf Maerzadí had a premonition that he would
accidentally kill his son in battle. Rather than live to see it happen, he committed suicide, saving his son,
and at the same time proving that the future isn’t set. Short of killing yourself, however, you can do little
to change your des-tiny, since you don’t know what choices will lead you to the particular point of time
that you saw.” She flipped her hand and the drop splattered against the log between them. “We know
that it’s possible to retrieve in-formation from the future—fortunetellers can often sense the paths a
person’s life may take—but we’ve been unable to refine the process to the point where you can choose
what, where, or when you want to see.”
Eragon found the entire concept of funneling knowledge through time profoundly disturbing. It raised too
many questions about the nature of reality. Whether fate and destiny really exist, the only thing I can
do is en-joy the present and live as honorably as possible. Yet he could not help asking, “What’s to
stop me, though, from scrying one of my memories? I’ve seen everything in them... so I should be able to
view them with magic.”
Arya’s gaze darted to meet his. “If you value your life, never attempt it. Many years ago, several of our
spellweavers devoted themselves to de-feating time’s enigmas. When they tried to summon up the past,
they only succeeded in creating a blurred image on their mirror before the spell consumed their energy
and killed them. We made no more experi-ments on the subject. It is argued that the spell would work if
more ma-gicians participated, but no one is willing to accept the risk and the the-ory remains unproven.
Even if one could scry the past, it would be of limited use. And to scry the future, one would have to
know exactly what was going to happen and where and when, which defeats the pur-pose.
“It’s a mystery, then, how people can have premonitions while sleeping, how they can do something
unconsciously that has defeated our greatest sages. Premonitions may be linked to the very nature and
fabric of magic... or they may function in a similar way to the dragons’ ancestral memories. We don’t
know. Many avenues of magic have yet to be ex-plored.” She stood in a single fluid movement. “Take
care not to lose yourself among them.”
DRIFTING

The valley widened throughout the morning as the rafts swept toward a bright gap between two
mountains. They reached the opening at mid-day and found themselves looking out of shadow upon a
sunny prairie that faded into the north.
Then the current pushed them beyond the frosted crags and the walls of the world dropped away to
reveal a gigantic sky and flat horizon. Al-most immediately, the air grew warmer. The Az Ragni curved to
the east, edging the foothills of the mountain range on one side and the plains on the other.
The amount of open space seemed to unsettle the dwarves. They mut-tered among themselves and
glanced longingly at the cavernous rift be-hind them.
Eragon found the sunlight invigorating. It was hard to ever really feel awake when three-quarters of the
day was spent in twilight. Behind his raft, Saphira launched herself out of the water and flew up over the
prai-rie until she dwindled to a winking speck in the azure dome above.
What do you see?he asked.
I see vast herds of gazelles to the north and east. To the west, the Hadarac Desert. That is all.
No one else? No Urgals, slavers, or nomads?
We are alone.
That evening, Thorv chose a small cove for their camp. While Dûth-mér fixed dinner, Eragon cleared a
space beside his tent, then drew Zar’roc and settled into the ready stance Brom had taught him when
they first sparred. Eragon knew he was at a disadvantage compared to the elves, and he had no intention
of arriving in Ellesméra out of practice.
With excruciating slowness, he looped Zar’roc over his head and brought it back down with both hands,
as if to cleave an enemy’s helm. He held the pose for a second. Keeping his motion under complete
con-trol, he pivoted to the right—twisting Zar’roc’s point to parry an imagi-nary blow—then stopped
with rigid arms.
Out of the corner of his eye, Eragon noticed Orik, Arya, and Thorv watching. He ignored them and
focused only on the ruby blade in his hands; he held it as if it were a snake that could writhe out of his
grip and bite his arm.
Turning again, he commenced a series of forms, flowing from one to another with disciplined ease as he
gradually increased his speed. In his mind, he was no longer in the shadowy cove, but surrounded by a
knot of ferocious Urgals and Kull. He ducked and slashed, parried, riposted, jumped to the side, and
stabbed in a whirl of activity. He fought with mindless energy, as he had in Farthen Dûr, with no thought
for the safety of his own flesh, dashing and tearing aside his imagined enemies.
He spun Zar’roc around—in an attempt to flip the hilt from one palm to another—then dropped the
sword as a jagged line of pain bisected his back. He staggered and fell. Above him, he could hear Arya
and the dwarves babbling, but all he saw was a constellation of sparkling red haze, like a bloody veil
dropped over the world. No sensation existed other than pain. It blotted out thought and reason, leaving
only a feral animal that screamed for release.
When Eragon recovered enough to notice his whereabouts, he found that he had been placed inside his
tent and wrapped tightly with blan-kets. Arya sat beside him, while Saphira’s head stuck through the

Page 405

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

en-trance flaps.
Was I out long?asked Eragon.
A while. You slept a little at the end. I tried to draw you from your body into mine and shield you from
the pain, but I could do little with you un-conscious.
Eragon nodded and closed his eyes. His entire body throbbed. Taking a deep breath, he looked up at
Arya and quietly asked, “How can I train?... How can I fight, or use magic?... I am a broken vessel.” His
face felt heavy with age as he spoke.
She answered just as softly: “You can sit and watch. You can listen. You can read. And you can learn.”
Despite her words, he heard a hitch of uncertainty, even fear, in her voice. He rolled onto his side to
avoid meeting her eyes. It shamed him to appear so helpless before her. “How did the Shade do this to
me?”
“I have no answers, Eragon. I am neither the wisest nor the strongest elf. We all do our best, and you
cannot be blamed for it. Perhaps time will heal your wound.” Arya pressed her fingers to his brow and
murmured, “Sé mor’ranr ono finna,” then left the tent.
Eragon sat and winced as his cramped back muscles stretched. He stared at his hands without seeing
them. I wonder if Murtagh’s scar ever pained him like mine does.
I don’t know,said Saphira.
A dead silence followed. Then: I’m afraid.
Why?
Because...He hesitated. Because nothing I do will prevent another attack. I don’t know when or
where it will happen, but I do know that it’s inevita-ble. So I wait, and every moment I fear that if
I lift something too heavy or stretch in the wrong way, the pain will return. My own body has
become the enemy.
Saphira hummed deep in her throat. I have no answers either. Life is both pain and pleasure. If this
is the price you must pay for the hours you enjoy, is it too much?
Yes,he snapped. He pulled off the blankets and shoved past her, stum-bling into the center of the camp,
where Arya and the dwarves sat around a fire. “Is there food left?” asked Eragon.
Dûthmér wordlessly filled a bowl and handed it to him. With a defer-ential expression, Thorv asked,
“Are you better now, Shadeslayer?” He and the other dwarves seemed awed by what they had seen.
“I’m fine.”
“You bear a heavy burden, Shadeslayer.”
Eragon scowled and abruptly walked to the edge of the tents, where he seated himself in darkness. He
could sense Saphira nearby, but she left him in peace. He swore under his breath and jabbed Dûthmér’s
stew with dull anger.

Page 406

Just as he took a bite, Orik said from beside him, “You should not treat them so.”
Eragon glared at Orik’s shadowed face. “What?”
“Thorv and his men were sent to protect you and Saphira. They will die for you if need be, and trust
their sacred burial to you. You should re-member that.”
Eragon bit back a sharp retort and gazed at the black surface of the river—always moving, never
stopping—in an attempt to calm his mind. “You’re right. I let my temper get away from me.”
Orik’s teeth gleamed in the night as he smiled. “It’s a lesson that every commander must learn. I had it
beaten into me by Hrothgar after I threw my boot at a dwarf who left his halberd where someone could
step on it.”
“Did you hit him?”
“I broke his nose,” chuckled Orik.
Despite himself, Eragon laughed as well. “I’ll remember not to do that.” He held the bowl with both
hands to keep them warm.
Eragon heard the jangle of metal as Orik extracted something from a pouch. “Here,” said the dwarf,
dropping a knot of intertwined gold rings on Eragon’s palm. “It’s a puzzle we use to test cleverness and
dexterity. There are eight bands. If you arrange them properly, they form a single ring. I’ve found it useful
for distracting myself when I’m troubled.”
“Thank you,” murmured Eragon, already entranced by the complexity of the gleaming nest.
“You can keep it if you can put it together.”
When he returned to his tent, Eragon lay on his stomach and inspected the rings in the dim firelight that
seeped past the entrance flaps. Four bands looped through four bands. Each was smooth on the bottom
half and an asymmetrical wriggling mass on the top, where it would weave through the other pieces.
As Eragon experimented with various configurations, he quickly be-came frustrated by a simple fact: it
seemed impossible to get the two sets of bands parallel so they would lie flat together.
Absorbed by the challenge, he forgot the terror he had just endured.
Eragon woke right before dawn. Scrubbing the sleep from his eyes, he exited the tent and stretched. His
breath turned white in the brisk morn-ing air. He nodded to Shrrgnien, who was keeping guard by the
fire, then strolled to the edge of the river and washed his face, blinking from the shock of the cold water.
He located Saphira with a flick of his mind, belted on Zar’roc, and headed toward her through the beech
trees that lined the Az Ragni. Be-fore long Eragon’s hands and face were slick with dew from a tangled
wall of chokecherry bushes that obstructed his way. With an effort, he pushed through the net of
branches and escaped onto the silent plains. A round hill rose before him. On its crest—like two ancient
statues—stood Saphira and Arya. They faced east, where a molten glow crept into the sky and
burnished the prairie amber.

Page 407

As the clear light struck the two figures, Eragon was reminded of how Saphira had watched the sunrise
from his bedpost only a few hours after she hatched. She was like a hawk or falcon with her hard,
sparkling eyes under their bony ridges, the fierce arch of her neck, and the lean strength etched into every
line of her body. She was a huntress, and endowed with all the savage beauty that the term implied.
Arya’s angled features and panther grace perfectly matched the dragon beside her. No discrepancy
existed between their demeanors as they stood bathed in dawn’s first rays.
A tingle of awe and joy shuddered along Eragon’s spine. This was where he belonged, as a Rider. Of all
the things in Alagaësia, he had been lucky enough to be joined with this. The wonder of it brought tears
to his eyes and a smile of wild exultation that dispelled all his doubts and fears in a surge of pure emotion.
Still smiling, he mounted the hill and took his place by Saphira as they surveyed the new day.
Arya looked at him. Eragon met her gaze, and something lurched within him. He flushed without
knowing why, feeling a sudden connection with her, a sense that she understood him better than anyone
other than Saphira. His reaction confused him, for no one had affected him in that manner before.
Throughout the rest of the day, all Eragon had to do was think back on that moment to make himself
smile and set his insides churning with a mixture of odd sensations he could not identify. He spent most of
his time seated against the raft’s cabin, working on Orik’s ring and watching the changing landscape.
Around midday they passed the mouth of a valley, and another river melded into the Az Ragni, doubling
its size and speed until the shores were over a mile apart. It was all the dwarves could do to keep the
rafts from being tossed like flotsam before the inexorable current and to avoid smashing into the trees that
occasionally floated by.
A mile after the rivers joined, the Az Ragni turned north and flowed past a lonely cloud-wreathed peak
that stood separate from the main body of the Beor range, like a gigantic watchtower built to keep vigil
over the plains.
The dwarves bowed to the peak when they saw it, and Orik told Er-agon, “There is Moldûn the Proud.
He is the last true mountain we shall see on this journey.”
When the rafts were moored for the evening, Eragon saw Orik unwrap a long black box inlaid with
mother-of-pearl, rubies, and curved lines of silver. Orik flicked a clasp, then raised the lid to reveal an
unstrung bow nestled in red velvet. The bow’s reflexed limbs were ebony, which formed the background
for intricate patterns of vines, flowers, animals, and runes, all executed in the finest gold. It was such a
luxurious weapon, Eragon wondered how anyone dared use it.
Orik strung the bow—it was nearly as tall as he was, but still no bigger than a child’s bow by Eragon’s
standards—put the box away, and said, “I’m going to find some fresh meat. I’ll be back in an hour.”
With that he disappeared into the brush. Thorv grunted disapprovingly, but made no move to stop him.
True to his word, Orik returned with a brace of long-necked geese. “I found a flock of them perched in
a tree,” he said, tossing the birds to Dûthmér.
As Orik retrieved the bejeweled case, Eragon asked, “What kind of wood is your bow made of?”
“Wood?” Orik laughed, shaking his head. “You can’t make a bow this short out of wood and cast an
arrow more than twenty yards; it breaks, or follows the string after a few shots. No, this is an Urgal horn
bow!”

Eragon eyed him suspiciously, sure that the dwarf was trying to fool him. “Horn isn’t flexible or springy
enough to make a bow.”
“Ah,” chortled Orik, “that’s because you have to know how to treat it right. We first learned to do it
with Feldûnost horns, but it works just as well with an Urgal’s. It’s done by cutting the horn in half
lengthwise, then trimming the outside coil until it’s the right thickness. The strip is boiled flat and sanded
into the final shape before being fixed to the belly of an ash stave with glue made from fish scales and the
skin from the roof of trout’s mouths. Then the back of the stave is covered with multiple lay-ers of sinew;
they give the bow its snap . The last step is decoration. The entire process can take almost a decade.”
“I’ve never heard of a bow built like that before,” said Eragon. It made his own weapon seem no more
than a crudely hacked branch. “How far does it shoot?”
“See for yourself,” said Orik. He let Eragon take the bow, which he held gingerly, for fear of scuffing its
finish. Orik removed an arrow from his quiver and handed it to him. “You’ll owe me an arrow, though.”
Eragon fit shaft to string, aimed over the Az Ragni, and pulled back. The bow’s draw length was less
than two feet, but he was surprised to find that its weight far exceeded that of his own bow; he was
barely strong enough to hold the string. He released the arrow and it vanished with a twang, only to
reappear far above the river. Eragon watched with amazement as the arrow landed in a spray of water
halfway across the Az Ragni.
He immediately reached through the barrier in his mind so that the magic’s power suffused him and said,
“Gath sem oro un lam iet.” After a few seconds, the arrow darted back through the air to land on his
out-stretched palm. “And there,” he said, “is the arrow I owe you.”
Orik clapped his fist to his chest and then embraced the arrow and bow with obvious delight.
“Wonderful! Now I still have an even two dozen. Otherwise, I would have had to wait until Hedarth to
replenish my stock.” He deftly unstrung the bow and stored it away, wrapping the case in soft rags to
protect it.
Eragon saw Arya watching. He asked her, “Do elves use horn bows as well? You’re so strong, a wood
bow would shatter if it was made heavy enough for you.”
“We sing our bows from trees that do not grow.” And then she walked away.
For days, they drifted through fields of spring grass while the Beor Mountains faded into a hazy white
wall behind them. The banks were often covered with vast herds of gazelles and small red deer that
watched them with liquid eyes.
Now that the Fanghur were no longer a threat, Eragon flew almost con-stantly with Saphira. It was their
first opportunity since before Gil’ead to spend so much time together in the air, and they took full
advantage of it. Also, Eragon welcomed the chance to escape the cramped deck of the raft, where he felt
awkward and unsettled with Arya so near.
ARYA SVIT-KONA

Eragon and his company followed the Az Ragni until it joined the Edda River, which then drifted into the

unknown east. At the juncture be-tween the rivers, they visited the dwarves’ trading outpost, Hedarth,
and exchanged their rafts for donkeys. Dwarves never used horses on account of their size.
Arya refused the steed offered to her, saying, “I will not return to the land of my ancestors on the back
of a donkey.”
Thorv frowned. “How will you keep pace with us?”
“I will run.” And run she did, outstripping Snowfire and the donkeys, only to sit waiting for them at the
next hill or copse. Despite her exer-tions, she displayed no sign of weariness when they stopped for the
night, nor any inclination to utter more than a few words between breakfast and supper. With every step,
she seemed to grow tenser.
From Hedarth, they trekked north, going up the Edda River toward its point of origin at Eldor Lake.
Du Weldenvarden came into view within three days. The forest first appeared as a hazy ridge on the
horizon, then quickly expanded into an emerald sea of ancient oaks, beeches, and maples. From
Saphira’s back, Eragon saw that the woods reached unbroken to the horizon both north and west, and
he knew they extended far beyond that, stretching the en-tire length of Alagaësia.
To him, the shadows underneath the trees’ arching boughs seemed mysterious and enticing, as well as
dangerous, for there lived the elves. Hidden somewhere in the dappled heart of Du Weldenvarden lay
Elles-méra—where he would complete his training—as well as Osilon, and other elven cities few
outsiders had visited since the fall of the Riders. The forest was a perilous place for mortals, Eragon felt,
certain to be rid-dled with strange magic and stranger creatures.
It’s like another world,he observed. A pair of butterflies spiraled around each other as they rose from
the dark interior of the forest.
I hope,said Saphira, there will be room for me within the trees on whatever path the elves use. I
cannot fly the whole time.
I’m sure they found ways to accommodate dragons during the time of the Riders.
Mmm.
That night, just as Eragon was about to seek his blankets, Arya ap-peared by his shoulder, like a spirit
materializing out of the air. Her stealth made him jump; he could never understand how she moved so
quietly. Before he could ask what she wanted, her mind touched his and she said, Follow me as silently
as you can.
The contact surprised him as much as the request. They had shared thoughts during the flight to Farthen
Dûr—it had been the only way Er-agon could speak to her through her self-induced coma—but since
Arya’s recovery, he had made no attempt to touch her mind again. It was a pro-foundly personal
experience. Whenever he reached out to another per-son’s consciousness, it felt as if a facet of his bare
soul rubbed against theirs. It seemed boorish and rude to initiate something so private with-out an
invitation, as well as a betrayal of Arya’s trust, slender as it was. Also, Eragon was afraid that such a link
would reveal his new and con-fused feelings for Arya, and he had no desire to be ridiculed for them.
He accompanied her as she slipped out from the ring of tents, carefully evaded Tríhga, who had taken
the first watch, and passed beyond the dwarves’ hearing. Within him, Saphira kept a close watch on his

progress, ready to leap to his side if need be.
Arya squatted on a moss-eaten log and wrapped her arms around her knees without looking at him.
“There are things you must know before we reach Ceris and Ellesméra so that you do not shame yourself
or me through your ignorance.”
“Such as?” He crouched opposite her, curious.
Arya hesitated. “During my years as Islanzadí’s ambassador, it was my observation that humans and
dwarves are quite similar. You share many of the same beliefs and passions. More than one human has
lived com-fortably among the dwarves because he or she can understand their cul-ture, as they
understand yours. You both love, lust, hate, fight, and create in much the same manner. Your friendship
with Orik and your accep-tance into Dûrgrimst Ingeitum are examples of this.” Eragon nodded, al-though
their differences seemed greater to him than that. “Elves, though, are not like other races.”
“You speak as though you weren’t one,” he said, echoing her words from Farthen Dûr.
“I have lived with the Varden for enough years to become accustomed to their traditions,” replied Arya
in a brittle tone.
“Ah... So then do you mean to say that elves don’t have the same emo-tions as dwarves and humans? I
find that hard to believe. All living things have the same basic needs and desires.”
“That is not what I mean to say!” Eragon recoiled, then frowned and studied her. It was unusual for her
to be so brusque. Arya closed her eyes and placed her fingers on her temples, taking a long breath.
“Because elves live for so many years, we consider courtesy to be the highest social virtue. You cannot
afford to give offense when a grudge can be held for decades or centuries. Courtesy is the only way to
prevent such hostility from accumulating. It doesn’t always succeed, but we adhere to our ritu-als
rigorously, for they protect us from extremes. Nor are elves fecund, so it is vital that we avoid conflict
among ourselves. If we shared the same rate of crime as you or the dwarves, we would soon be extinct.
“There is a proper way to greet the sentinels in Ceris, certain patterns and forms that you must observe
when presented to Queen Islanzadí, and a hundred different manners in which to greet those around you,
if it’s not better to just remain quiet.”
“With all your customs,” Eragon risked saying, “it seems as though you’ve only made it easier to offend
people.”
A smile flickered across her lips. “Perhaps. You know as well as I that you will be judged by the highest
standards. If you make a mistake, the elves will think you did it on purpose. And only harm will come if
they discover that it was born of ignorance. Far better to be thought rude and capable than rude and
incapable, else you risk being manipulated like The Serpent in a match of Runes. Our politics move in
cycles that are both subtle and lengthy. What you see or hear of an elf one day may only be a slight move
in a strategy that reaches back millennia, and may have no bearing on how that elf will behave tomorrow.
It is a game that we all play but few control, a game that you are about to enter.
“Now perhaps you realize why I say elves are not like other races. The dwarves are also long-lived, yet
they are more prolific than us and do not share our restraint or our taste for intrigue. And humans...” She
let her voice fade into a tactful silence.
“Humans,” said Eragon, “do the best they can with what they are given.”

Page 411

“Even so.”
“Why don’t you tell Orik all this as well? He’ll be staying in Ellesméra, same as me.”
An edge crept into Arya’s voice. “He is already somewhat familiar with our etiquette. However, as a
Rider, you would do well to appear better educated than him.”
Eragon accepted her rebuke without protest. “What must I learn?”
So Arya began to tutor him and, through him, Saphira in the niceties of elven society. First she explained
that when one elf meets another, they stop and touch their first two fingers to their lips to indicate that
“we shall not distort the truth during our conversation.” This is followed by the phrase “Atra esterní ono
thelduin” to which one replies “Atra du evarínya ono varda.”
“And,” said Arya, “if you are being especially formal, a third response is made: ‘Un atra mor’ranr lífa
unin hjarta onr,’ which means, ‘And may peace live in your heart.’ These lines were adopted from a
blessing that was made by a dragon when our pact with them was finalized. It goes:
Atra esterní ono thelduin,
Mor’ranr lífa unin hjarta onr,
Un du evarínya ono varda.
“Or: ‘May good fortune rule over you, peace live in your heart, and the stars watch over you.’”
“How do you know who is supposed to speak first?”
“If you greet someone with greater status than yourself or if you wish to honor a subordinate, then speak
first. If you greet someone with less status than yourself, speak last. But if you are uncertain of your
position, give your counterpart a chance to speak, and if they are silent, speak first. Such is the rule.”
Does it apply to me as well?asked Saphira.
Arya plucked a dry leaf from the ground and crumpled it between her fingers. Behind her, the camp
faded into shadow as the dwarves banked the fire, dampening the flames with a layer of dirt so that the
coals and embers would survive until morning. “As a dragon, none are higher than you in our culture. Not
even the queen would claim authority over you. You may do and say as you wish. We do not expect
dragons to be bound by our laws.”
Next she showed Eragon how to twist his right hand and place it over his sternum in a curious gesture.
“This,” she said, “you will use when you meet Islanzadí. By it you indicate that you offer her your loyalty
and obe-dience.”
“Is it binding, like my oath of fealty to Nasuada?”
“No, only a courtesy, and a small one at that.”
Eragon struggled to remember the sundry modes of address that Arya instructed them in. The salutations
varied from man to woman, adults to children, boys to girls, as well as by rank and prestige. It was a

Page 412

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

daunting list, but one that Eragon knew he had to memorize perfectly.
When he had absorbed all he could, Arya stood and dusted her hands. “So long as you do not forget,
you’ll do well enough.” She turned to leave.
“Wait,” said Eragon. He reached out to stop her, then snatched back his hand before she noticed his
presumption. She looked over her shoulder with a query in her dark eyes, and his stomach clenched as
he tried to find a way to voice his thoughts. Despite his best efforts, he ended up just saying, “Are you
well, Arya?... You’ve seemed distracted and out of sorts ever since we left Hedarth.”
As Arya’s face hardened into a blank mask, he winced inwardly, know-ing that he had chosen the
wrong approach, although he could not fathom why the question should offend her.
“When we are in Du Weldenvarden,” she informed him, “I expect that you will not speak to me in such a
familiar way, unless you wish to cause affront.” She stalked away.
Run after her!exclaimed Saphira.
What?
We can’t afford to have her angry with you. Go apologize.
His pride rebelled. No! It’s her fault, not mine.
Go apologize, Eragon, or I’ll fill your tent with carrion.It was no idle threat.
How?
Saphira thought for a second, then told him what to do. Without argu-ing, he jumped to his feet and
darted in front of Arya, forcing her to stop. She regarded him with a haughty expression.
He touched his fingers to his lips and said, “Arya Svit-kona,” using the honorific he had just learned for a
woman of great wisdom. “I spoke badly, and for that I cry your pardon. Saphira and I were concerned
for your welfare. After all you’ve done for us, it seemed the least we could do was offer our help in
return, if you need it.”
Finally, Arya relented and said, “Your concern is appreciated. And I too spoke badly.” She looked
down. In the dark, the outline of her limbs and torso was painfully rigid. “You ask what troubles me,
Eragon? Do you truly wish to know? Then I will tell you.” Her voice was as soft as this-tledown floating
on the wind. “I am afraid.”
Dumbfounded, Eragon made no response, and she stepped past, leaving him alone in the night.
CERIS

On the morning of the fourth day, when Eragon rode alongside Shrrgnien, the dwarf said, “So tell me, do
men really have ten toes, as is said? For truly I have never traveled beyond our borders before.”
“Of course we have ten toes!” said Eragon, astonished. He shifted in Snowfire’s saddle, lifted his foot,

Page 413

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

removed his right boot and sock, and wiggled his toes under Shrrgnien’s amazed eyes. “Don’t you?”
Shrrgnien shook his head. “Nay, we have seven on each foot. It is how Helzvog made us. Five is too
few and six is the wrong number, but seven... seven is just right.” He glanced at Eragon’s foot again, then
spurred his donkey ahead and began speaking animatedly to Ama and Hedin, who eventually handed him
several silver coins.
I think,said Eragon as he pulled the boot back on, that I was just the source of a bet. For some
reason, Saphira found that immensely amusing.
As dusk fell and the full moon rose, the Edda River drew ever closer to the fringe of Du Weldenvarden.
They rode down a narrow trail through tangled dogwood and rosebushes in full bloom, which filled the
evening air with the flowers’ warm scent.
Eager anticipation swelled within Eragon as he gazed into the dark for-est, knowing they had already
entered the elves’ domain and were close to Ceris. He leaned forward in Snowfire’s saddle, the reins
pulled tight between his hands. Saphira’s excitement was as great as his own; she ranged overhead,
flicking her tail back and forth with impatience.
Eragon felt as if they had wandered into a dream. It doesn’t seem real, he said.
Aye. Here the legends of old still bestride the earth.
At last they came upon a small meadow set between the river and for-est. “Stop here,” said Arya in a
low voice. She walked forward until she stood alone in the midst of the lush grass, then cried in the
ancient lan-guage, “Come forth, my brethren! You have nothing to fear. ’Tis I, Arya of Ellesméra. My
companions are friends and allies; they mean us no harm.” She added other words as well, ones alien to
Eragon.
For several minutes, the only sound was the river rushing behind them, until from underneath the still
leaves came a line of Elvish, so quick and fleeting that Eragon missed the meaning. Arya responded: “I
do.”
With a rustle, two elves stood on the edge of the forest and two ran lightly out on the boughs of a
gnarled oak. Those on the ground bore long spears with white blades, while the others held bows. All
were garbed in tunics the color of moss and bark underneath flowing cloaks clasped at the shoulder with
ivory brooches. One had tresses as black as Arya’s. Three had hair like starlight.
The elves dropped from the trees and embraced Arya, laughing in their clear, pure voices. They joined
hands and danced in a circle around her like children, singing merrily as they spun through the grass.
Eragon watched in amazement. Arya had never given him reason to suspect that elves liked to—or even
could —laugh. It was a wondrous sound, like flutes and harps trilling with delight at their own music. He
wished that he could listen to it forever.
Then Saphira drifted over the river and settled beside Eragon. At her approach, the elves cried out in
alarm and aimed their weapons toward her. Arya spoke quickly in soothing tones, motioning first at
Saphira, then at Eragon. When she paused for breath, Eragon drew back the glove on his right hand,
tilted his palm so that the gedwëy ignasia caught the moonlight, and said, as he once had to Arya so long
ago, “Eka fricai un Shur’tugal.” I am a Rider and friend. Remembering his lesson from yester-day, he
touched his lips, adding, “Atra esterní ono thelduin.”

Page 414

The elves lowered their weapons as their angled faces lit up with radi-ant joy. They pressed their
forefingers to their lips and bowed to Saphira and him, murmuring their reply in the ancient language.
Then they rose, pointed at the dwarves, and laughed as if at a hidden joke. Drifting back into the forest,
they waved their hands and called, “Come, come!”
Eragon followed Arya with Saphira and the dwarves, who were grum-bling among themselves. As they
passed between the trees, the canopy overhead plunged them into velvet darkness, except where
fragments of moonlight gleamed through chinks in the shell of overlapping leaves. Er-agon could hear the
elves whispering and laughing all around, though he could not see them. Occasionally, they would call
directions when he or the dwarves blundered.
Ahead, a fire glowed through the trees, sending shadows racing like sprites across the leafy ground. As
Eragon entered the radius of light, he saw three small huts clustered together around the base of a large
oak. High in the tree was a roofed platform where a watchman could observe the river and forest. A pole
had been lashed between two of the huts: from it hung bundles of drying plants.
The four elves vanished into the huts, then returned with their arms piled high with fruits and
vegetables—but no meat—and began prepar-ing a meal for their guests. They hummed as they worked,
flitting from one tune to another as the fancy took them. When Orik asked their names, the dark-haired
elf pointed to himself and said, “I am Lifaen of House Rílvenar. And my companions are Edurna, Celdin,
and Narí.”
Eragon sat beside Saphira, happy for an opportunity to rest and to watch the elves. Though all four were
male, their faces resembled Arya’s, with delicate lips, thin noses, and large slanted eyes that shone under
their brows. The rest of their bodies matched, with narrow shoulders and slender arms and legs. Each
was more fair and noble than any human Er-agon had seen, albeit in a rarefied, exotic manner.
Who ever thought I would get to visit the elves’ homeland?Eragon asked himself. He grinned and leaned
against the corner of a hut, drowsy with the fire’s warmth. Above him, Saphira’s dancing blue eyes
tracked the elves with unwavering precision.
More magic is in this race,she finally remarked, than either humans or dwarves. They do not feel as
if they come from the earth or the stone, but rather from another realm, half in, half out, like
reflections seen through wa-ter.
They certainly are graceful,he said. The elves moved like dancers, their every action smooth and lithe.
Brom had told Eragon that it was rude for someone to speak with their mind to a Rider’s dragon without
permission, and the elves adhered to that custom, voicing aloud their comments to Saphira, who would
then answer the elves directly. Saphira usually refrained from touching the thoughts of humans and
dwarves and allowed Eragon to relay her words, since few members of those races had the training to
guard their minds if they wished for privacy. It also seemed an imposition to use such an in-timate form of
contact for casual exchanges. The elves had no such inhi-bitions, though; they welcomed Saphira into
their minds, reveling in her presence.
At last the food was ready and served on carved plates that felt like dense bone, although wood grain
wandered through the flowers and vines decorating the rim. Eragon was also supplied with a flagon of
gooseberry wine—made of the same unusual material—with a sculpted dragon wrapped around its stem.

As they ate, Lifaen produced a set of reed pipes and began to play a flowing melody, his fingers running
along the various holes. Soon the tall-est silver-haired elf, Narí, raised his voice and sang:
O!
The day is done; the stars are bright;The leaves are still; the moon is white!Laugh at woe and laugh at
foe,Menoa’s scion now is safe this night!
A forest child we lost to strife;A sylvan daughter caught by life!Freed of fear and freed of flame,She tore
a Rider from the shadows rife!
Again the dragons rise on wing,And we avenge their suffering!Strong of blade and strong of arm,The
time is ripe for us to kill a king!
O!
The wind is soft; the river deep;
The trees are tall; the birds do sleep!
Laugh at woe and laugh at foe,
The hour has arrived for joy to reap!
When Narí finished, Eragon released his pent-up breath. He had never heard such a voice before; it felt
as if the elf had revealed his essence, his very soul. “That was beautiful, Narí-vodhr.”
“A rough composition, Argetlam,” demurred Narí. “But I thank you, nevertheless.”
Thorv grunted. “Very pretty, Master Elf. However, there are matters more serious than reciting verse
that we must attend to. Are we to ac-company Eragon farther?”
“No,” said Arya quickly, drawing looks from the other elves. “You may return home in the morning. We
will assure that Eragon reaches Elles-méra.”
Thorv dipped his head. “Then our task is complete.”
As Eragon lay on the bedding the elves had arranged for him, he strained his ears to catch Arya’s
speech, which drifted from one of the huts. Though she used many unfamiliar words in the ancient
language, he deduced that she was explaining to their hosts how she had lost Saphira’s egg and the
events since. A long silence followed after she stopped, then an elf said, “It is good that you have
returned, Arya Dröttningu. Islanzadí was sorely wounded by grief when you were captured and the egg
was stolen, and by Urgals no less! She was—and is—sick at heart.”
“Hush, Edurna... hush,” chided another. “Dvergar are small, but they have sharp ears, and I am sure
these will report to Hrothgar.”
Then their voices dropped and Eragon could discern no more from the murmur of voices, which melded
into the whisper of leaves as he drifted to sleep, the elf’s song repeating endlessly through his dreams.
The scent of flowers was heavy in the air when Eragon woke to behold a sun-drenched Du

Weldenvarden. Above him arched a mottled panoply of drifting leaves, supported by the thick trunks that
buried themselves in the dry, bare ground. Only moss, lichen, and a few low shrubs survived in the
pervasive green shade. The scarcity of underbrush made it possible to see for great distances between
the knotted pillars and to walk about freely beneath the dappled ceiling.
Rolling to his feet, Eragon found Thorv and his guards packed and ready to leave. Orik’s donkey was
tied behind Ekksvar’s steed. Eragon ap-proached Thorv and said, “Thank you, all of you, for protecting
me and Saphira. Please convey our gratitude to Ûndin.”
Thorv pressed his fist to his chest. “I will carry your words.” He hesi-tated and looked back at the huts.
“Elves are a queer race, full of light and dark. In the morning, they drink with you; in the evening, they
stab you. Keep thine back to a wall, Shadeslayer. Capricious, they are.”
“I will remember that.”
“Mmm.” Thorv gestured toward the river. “They plan to travel up Eldor Lake in boats. What will you do
with thine horse? We could return him to Tarnag with us, and from there, to Tronjheim.”
“Boats!” cried Eragon with dismay. He had always planned to bring Snowfire to Ellesméra. It was
convenient to have a horse whenever Saphira was away, or in places too confined for her bulk. He
fingered the sparse bristles along his jaw. “That is a kind offer. Will you make sure Snowfire is well cared
for? I couldn’t bear it if anything were to happen to him.”
“On mine honor,” pledged Thorv, “you will return to find him fat and sleek.”
Eragon fetched Snowfire and transferred the stallion, his saddle, and his grooming supplies into Thorv’s
care. He bade each of the warriors fare-well, then he, Saphira, and Orik watched the dwarves ride back
along the trail they had arrived on.
Returning to the huts, Eragon and the remainder of his party followed the elves to a thicket on the edge
of the Edda River. There, docked on either side of a boulder, were two white canoes with vines carved
along their sides.
Eragon boarded the nearest boat and stowed his pack beneath his feet. He was amazed by how light the
craft was; he could have lifted it with a single hand. Even more astounding, the hulls appeared to be
composed of birch-bark panels melded into a seamless whole. Curious, he touched the side. The bark
was hard and taut, like stretched parchment, and cool from its contact with the water. He rapped it with
a knuckle. The fi-brous shell reverberated like a muted drum.
“Are all your boats made this way?” he asked.
“All except the very largest,” answered Narí, seating himself at the prow of Eragon’s vessel. “For those,
we sing the finest cedar and oak into shape.”
Before Eragon could ask what he meant, Orik joined their canoe while Arya and Lifaen appropriated
the second one. Arya turned to Edurna and Celdin—who stood on the bank—and said, “Guard this way
so that none may follow us, and tell no one of our presence. The queen must be the first to know. I will
send reinforcements as soon as we reach Sílthrim.”
“Arya Dröttningu.”

Page 417

“May the stars watch over you!” she answered.
Bending forward, Narí and Lifaen drew spiked poles ten feet long from inside the boats and began
propelling the vessels upstream. Saphira slid into the water behind them and clawed her way along the
riverbed until they were level. When Eragon looked at her, she winked lazily, then submerged, forcing the
river to swell into a mound over her jagged back. The elves laughed as she did so and made many
compliments about her size and strength.
After an hour, they reached Eldor Lake, which was rough with small, jagged waves. Birds and flies
swarmed by a wall of trees edging the west-ern shore, while the eastern shore sloped up into the plains.
On that side meandered hundreds of deer.
Once they escaped the river’s current, Narí and Lifaen stowed their poles, then distributed leaf-bladed
paddles. Orik and Arya already knew how to steer a boat, but Narí had to explain the process to
Eragon. “We turn toward whichever side you paddle on,” said the elf. “So if I paddle on the right and
Orik paddles on the left, then you must paddle first on one side, then the other, else we will drift off
course.” In the daylight, Narí’s hair shimmered like the finest wire, each strand a fiery line.
Eragon soon mastered the ability, and as the motion became habitual, his mind was freed to daydream.
Thus, he floated up the cool lake, lost in the fantastic worlds hidden behind his eyes. When he paused to
rest his arms, he once again pulled Orik’s puzzle ring from his belt and struggled to arrange the obstinate
gold bands into the correct pattern.
Narí noticed what he was doing. “May I see that ring?”
Eragon passed it to the elf, who turned his back. For a few moments, Eragon and Orik maneuvered the
canoe alone as Narí picked at the en-twined bands. Then, with a pleased exclamation, Narí raised his
hand, and the completed ring flashed on his middle finger. “A delightful riddle,” said Narí. He slipped off
the ring and shook it, so that it was in its origi-nal state when he returned it to Eragon.
“How did you solve it?” demanded Eragon, dismayed and envious that Narí had been able to master the
puzzle so easily. “Wait... Don’t tell me. I want to figure it out on my own.”
“Of course,” said Narí, smiling.
WOUNDS OF THE PAST

For three and a half days, the citizens of Carvahall discussed the latest attack, the tragedy of young
Elmund’s death, and what could possibly be done to escape their thrice-blasted situation. The debate
raged with bit-ter fury through every room of every home. In the space of a word, friends turned against
friends, husbands against wives, children against parents, only to reconcile moments later in their frantic
attempt to dis-cover a means of survival.
Some said that since Carvahall was doomed anyway, they might as well kill the Ra’zac and remaining
soldiers so as to at least have their venge-ance. Others said that if Carvahall really was doomed, then the
only logi-cal course was to surrender and trust themselves to the king’s mercy, even if it did mean torture
and death for Roran and enslavement for eve-ryone else. And still others sided with neither opinion, but
rather de-scended into a sullen black anger directed at everyone who had brought about this calamity.
Many did their best to hide their panic in the depths of a tankard.

The Ra’zac themselves had apparently realized that with eleven soldiers dead they no longer had a large
enough force to attack Carvahall, and thus had retreated farther down the road, where they were content
to post sentinels across Palancar Valley and wait. “Wait for flea-bitten troops from Ceunon or Gil’ead, if
you ask me,” Loring said at one meet-ing. Roran listened to that and more, kept his own council, and
silently judged the various schemes. They all seemed dangerously risky.
Roran still had not told Sloan that he and Katrina were engaged. He knew it was foolish to wait, but he
feared how the butcher would react when he learned that Roran and Katrina had flouted tradition and, in
do-ing so, undermined Sloan’s authority. Besides, there was plenty of work to divert Roran’s attention;
he convinced himself that strengthening the for-tifications around Carvahall was his most important task at
the moment.
Getting people to help was easier than Roran anticipated. After the last fight, the villagers were more apt
to listen and to obey him—that is, those who did not blame him for causing their predicament. He was
mystified by his new authority, until he realized that it was the result of the awe, respect, and perhaps
even fear his kills had elicited. They called him Stronghammer. Roran Stronghammer.
The name pleased him.
As night engulfed the valley, Roran leaned against a corner of Horst’s dining room, his eyes closed.
Conversation flowed from the men and women seated around the candlelit table. Kiselt was in the middle
of ex-plaining the state of Carvahall’s supplies. “We won’t starve,” he con-cluded, “but if we can’t tend
to our fields and our flocks soon, we might as well cut our own throats before next winter. It would be a
kinder fate.”
Horst scowled. “Dog tripe!”
“Dog tripe or not,” said Gertrude, “I doubt we’ll have a chance to find out. We outnumbered the
soldiers ten to one when they arrived. They lost eleven men; we lost twelve, and I’m caring for another
nine wounded. What happens, Horst, when they outnumber us ten to one?”
“We will give the bards a reason to remember our names,” retorted the smith. Gertrude shook her head
sadly.
Loring banged a fist on the table. “And I say it’s our turn to strike, be-fore we are outnumbered. All we
need are a few men, shields, and spears, and we can wipe out their infestation. It could be done
tonight!”
Roran shifted restlessly. He had heard all this before, and like before, Loring’s proposal ignited an
argument that consumed the group. After an hour, the debate still showed no sign of being resolved, nor
had any new ideas been presented, except for Thane’s suggestion that Gedric should go tan his own
hide, which nearly resulted in a fistfight.
Finally, when the conversation lulled, Roran limped to the table as quickly as his injured calf would
allow. “I have something to say.” For him it was the equivalent of stepping on a long thorn and then
yanking it out without stopping to consider the pain; it had to be done, and the faster the better.
All eyes—hard, soft, angry, kind, indifferent, and curious—turned to him, and Roran took a deep
breath. “Indecision will kill us just as surely as a sword or an arrow.” Orval rolled his eyes, but the rest
still listened. “I don’t know if we should attack or flee—”

“Where?” snorted Kiselt.
“—but I do know one thing: our children, our mothers, and our infirm must be protected from danger.
The Ra’zac have barred us from Cawley and the other farms down the valley. So what? We know this
land better than any in Alagaësia, and there is a place... there is a place where our loved ones will be
safe: the Spine.”
Roran winced as a barrage of outraged voices assaulted him. Sloan was the loudest, shouting, “I’ll be
hanged before I set foot in those cursed mountains!”
“Roran,” said Horst, overriding the commotion. “You of all people should know that the Spine is too
dangerous—it’s where Eragon found the stone that brought the Ra’zac! The mountains are cold, and
filled with wolves, bears, and other monsters. Why even mention them?”
To keep Katrina safe!Roran wanted to scream. Instead, he said, “Be-cause no matter how many
soldiers the Ra’zac summon, they will never dare enter the Spine. Not after Galbatorix lost half his army
in it.”
“That was a long time ago,” said Morn doubtfully.
Roran jumped on his statement. “And the stories have grown all the more frightening in the telling! A trail
already exists to the top of Igualda Falls. All we have to do is send the children and others up there.
They’ll only be on the fringe of the mountains, but they’ll still be safe. If Carva-hall is taken, they can wait
until the soldiers leave, then find refuge in Therinsford.”
“It is too dangerous,” growled Sloan. The butcher gripped the edge of the table so hard that the tips of
his fingers turned white. “The cold, the beasts. No sane man would send his family among those.”
“But...” Roran faltered, put off-balance by Sloan’s response. Though he knew the butcher hated the
Spine more than most—because his wife had plummeted to her death from the cliffs beside Igualda
Falls—he had hoped that Sloan’s rabid desire to protect Katrina would be strong enough to overcome
his aversion. Roran now understood he would have to win over Sloan just like everyone else. Adopting a
placating tone, Ro-ran said, “It’s not that bad. The snow is already melting off the peaks. It’s no colder in
the Spine than it was down here a few months ago. And I doubt that wolves or bears would bother such
a large group.”
Sloan grimaced, twisting his lips up over his teeth, and shook his head. “You will find nothing but death
in the Spine.”
The others seemed to agree, which only strengthened Roran’s determination, for he was convinced that
Katrina would die unless he could sway them. He scanned the long oval of faces, searching for a
sympathetic ex-pression. “Delwin, I know it’s cruel of me to say it, but if Elmund hadn’t been in
Carvahall, he would still be alive. Surely you must agree that this is the right thing to do! You have an
opportunity to save other parents from your suffering.”
No one responded. “And Birgit!” Roran dragged himself toward her, clutching the backs of chairs to
keep himself from falling. “Do you want Nolfavrell to share his father’s fate? He has to leave. Can’t you
see, that is the only way he’ll be safe....” Though Roran did his best to fight it, he could feel tears flood his
eyes. “It’s for the children!” he shouted angrily.

Page 420

The room was silent as Roran stared at the wood beneath his hands, struggling to control himself. Delwin
was the first to stir. “I will never leave Carvahall so long as my son’s killers remain here. However,” he
paused, then continued with painful slowness, “I cannot deny the truth of your words; the children must
be protected.”
“As I said from the beginning,” declared Tara.
Then Baldor spoke: “Roran is right. We can’t allow ourselves to be blinded by fear. Most of us have
climbed to the top of the falls at one time or another. It’s safe enough.”
“I too,” Birgit finally added, “must agree.”
Horst nodded. “I would rather not do it, but considering the circum-stances.... I don’t think we have any
other choice.” After a minute, the various men and women began to reluctantly acquiesce to the
proposal.
“Nonsense!” exploded Sloan. He stood and stabbed an accusing finger at Roran. “How will they get
enough food to wait for weeks on end? They can’t carry it. How will they stay warm? If they light fires,
they’ll be seen! How, how, how? If they don’t starve, they’ll freeze. If they don’t freeze, they’ll be eaten.
If they’re not eaten... Who knows? They may fall!”
Roran spread his hands. “If we all help, they will have plenty of food. Fire won’t be a problem if they
move farther back into the forest, which they must anyway, since there isn’t room to camp right by the
falls.”
“Excuses! Justifications!”
“What would you have us do, Sloan?” asked Morn, eyeing him with curiosity.
Sloan laughed bitterly. “Not this.”
“Then what?”
“It doesn’t matter. Only this is the wrong choice.”
“You don’t have to participate,” pointed out Horst.
“Nor will I,” said the butcher. “Proceed if you want, but neither I nor my blood shall enter the Spine
while I still have marrow in my bones.” He grabbed his cap and left with a venomous glare at Roran, who
re-turned the scowl in kind.
As Roran saw it, Sloan was endangering Katrina through his own pig-headed stubbornness. If he can’t
bring himself to accept the Spine as a place of refuge, decided Roran, then he’s become my enemy
and I have to take matters into my own hands.
Horst leaned forward on his elbows and interlaced his thick fingers. “So... If we are going to use
Roran’s plan, what preparations will be needed?” The group exchanged wary glances, then gradually
began to dis-cuss the topic.
Roran waited until he was convinced that he had achieved his goal be-fore slipping out of the dining
room. Loping through the dusky village, he searched for Sloan along the inner perimeter of the tree wall.

Page 421

Eventually, he spotted the butcher hunched underneath a torch, his shield clasped around his knees.
Roran spun around on one foot and ran to Sloan’s shop, where he hurried to the kitchen in the back.
Katrina paused in the middle of setting their table and stared at him with amazement. “Roran! Why are
you here? Did you tell Father?”
“No.” He came forward and took her arm, savoring the touch. Just be-ing in the same room with her
filled him with joy. “I have a great favor to ask of you. It’s been decided to send the children and a few
others into the Spine above Igualda Falls.” Katrina gasped. “I want you to accompany them.”
With a shocked expression, Katrina pulled free of his grasp and turned to the open fireplace, where she
hugged herself and stared at the bed of throbbing embers. For a long time, she said nothing. Then:
“Father forbade me to go near the falls after Mother died. Albem’s farm is the clos-est I’ve been to the
Spine in over ten years.” She shivered, and her voice grew accusing. “How can you suggest that I
abandon both you and my father? This is my home as much as yours. And why should I leave when
Elain, Tara, and Birgit will remain?”
“Katrina, please.” He tentatively put his hands on her shoulders. “The Ra’zac are here for me, and I
would not have you harmed because of that. As long as you’re in danger, I can’t concentrate on what
has to be done: defending Carvahall.”
“Who would respect me for fleeing like a coward?” She lifted her chin. “I would be ashamed to stand
before the women of Carvahall and call myself your wife.”
“Coward? There is no cowardice in guarding and protecting the chil-dren in the Spine. If anything, it
requires greater courage to enter the mountains than to stay.”
“What horror is this?” whispered Katrina. She twisted in his arms, eyes shining and mouth set firmly.
“The man who would be my husband no longer wants me by his side.”
He shook his head. “That’s not true. I—”
“It is true! What if you are killed while I’m gone?”
“Don’t say—”
“No! Carvahall has little hope of survival, and if we must die, I would rather die together than huddle in
the Spine without life or heart. Let those with children tend to their own. As will I.” A tear rolled down
her cheek.
Gratitude and wonder surged through Roran at the strength of her de-votion. He looked deep into her
eyes. “It is for that love that I would have you go. I know how you feel. I know that this is the hardest
sacri-fice either of us could make, and I ask it of you now.”
Katrina shuddered, her entire body rigid, her white hands clenched around her muslin sash. “If I do this,”
she said with a shaking voice, “you must promise me, here and now, that you will never make such a
request again. You must promise that even if we faced Galbatorix himself and only one of us could
escape, you would not ask me to leave.”
Roran looked at her helplessly. “I can’t.”

Page 422

“Then how can you expect me to do what you won’t!” she cried. “That is my price, and neither gold nor
jewels nor pretty words can replace your oath. If you don’t care enough for me to make your own
sacrifice, Roran Stronghammer, then be gone and I never wish to see your face again!”
I cannot lose her.Though it pained him almost beyond endurance, he bowed his head and said, “You
have my word.”
Katrina nodded and sank into a chair—her back stiff and upright—and blotted her tears on the cuff of
her sleeve. In a quiet voice, she said, “Fa-ther will hate me for going.”
“How will you tell him?”
“I won’t,” she said defiantly. “He would never let me enter the Spine, but he has to realize that this is my
decision. Anyway, he won’t dare pur-sue me into the mountains; he fears them more than death itself.”
“He may fear losing you even more.”
“We shall see. If—when—the time comes to return, I expect you to have already spoken to him about
our engagement. That should give him enough time to reconcile himself to the fact.”
Roran found himself nodding in agreement, all the while thinking that they would be lucky if events
worked out so well.
WOUNDS OF THE PRESENT

When dawn arrived, Roran woke and lay staring at the whitewashed ceiling while he listened to the slow
rasp of his own breathing. After a minute, he rolled off the bed, dressed, and proceeded to the kitchen,
where he procured a chunk of bread, smeared it with soft cheese, then stepped out onto the front porch
to eat and admire the sunrise.
His tranquility was soon disrupted when a herd of unruly children dashed through the garden of a nearby
house, shrieking with delight at their game of Catch-the-Cat, followed by a number of adults intent on
snaring their respective charges. Roran watched the cacophonous parade vanish around a corner, then
placed the last of the bread in his mouth and returned to the kitchen, which had filled with the rest of the
house-hold.
Elain greeted him. “Good morning, Roran.” She pushed open the win-dow shutters and gazed up at the
sky. “It looks like it may rain again.”
“The more the better,” asserted Horst. “It’ll help keep us hidden while we climb Narnmor Mountain.”
“Us?” inquired Roran. He sat at the table beside Albriech, who was rubbing the sleep from his eyes.
Horst nodded. “Sloan was right about the food and supplies; we have to help carry them up the falls, or
else there won’t be enough.”
“Will there still be men to defend Carvahall?”
“Of course, of course.”

Page 423

Once they all had breakfast, Roran helped Baldor and Albriech wrap spare food, blankets, and supplies
into three large bundles that they slung across their shoulders and hauled to the north end of the village.
Roran’s calf pained him, but not unbearably. Along the way, they met the three brothers Darmmen,
Larne, and Hamund, who were similarly burdened.
Just inside the trench that circumnavigated the houses, Roran and his companions found a large gathering
of children, parents, and grandparents all busy organizing for the expedition. Several families had
volunteered their donkeys to carry goods and the younger children; the animals were picketed in an
impatient, braying line that added to the overall confusion.
Roran set his bundle on the ground and scanned the group. He saw Svart—Ivor’s uncle and, at nearly
sixty, the oldest man in Carvahall— seated on a bale of clothes, teasing a baby with the tip of his long
white beard; Nolfavrell, who was guarded over by Birgit; Felda, Nolla, Calitha, and a number of other
mothers with worried expressions; and a great many reluctant people, both men and women. Roran also
saw Katrina among the crowd. She glanced up from a knot she was tying on a pack and smiled at him,
then returned to her task.
Since no one seemed to be in charge, Roran did his best to sort out the chaos by overseeing the
arranging and packaging of the various supplies. He discovered a shortage of waterskins, but when he
asked for more, he ended up with thirteen too many. Delays such as those consumed the early-morning
hours.
In the middle of discussing with Loring the possible need for extra shoes, Roran stopped as he noticed
Sloan standing at the entrance to an alleyway.
The butcher surveyed the mass of activity before him. Contempt cut into the lines along his downturned
mouth. His sneer hardened into en-raged incredulity as he spotted Katrina, who had shouldered her
pack, removing any possibility that she was there only to help. A vein throbbed down the middle of
Sloan’s forehead.
Roran hurried toward Katrina, but Sloan reached her first. He grabbed the top of the pack and shook it
violently, shouting, “Who made you do this?” Katrina said something about the children and tried to pull
free, but Sloan yanked at the pack—twisting her arms as the straps slid off her shoulders—and threw it
on the ground so that the contents scattered. Still shouting, Sloan grabbed Katrina’s arm and began to
drag her away. She dug in her heels and fought, her copper hair swirling over her face like a dust storm.
Furious, Roran threw himself at Sloan and tore him from Katrina, shov-ing the butcher in the chest so
that he stumbled backward several yards. “Stop! I’m the one who wanted her to go.”
Sloan glared at Roran and snarled, “You have no right!”
“I have every right.” Roran looked at the ring of spectators who had gathered around and then declared
so that all could hear: “Katrina and I are engaged to be married, and I would not have my future wife
treated so!” For the first time that day, the villagers fell completely silent; even the donkeys were quiet.
Surprise and a deep, inconsolable pain sprang onto Sloan’s vulnerable face, along with the glimmer of
tears. For a moment, Roran felt sympathy for him, then a series of contortions distorted Sloan’s visage,
each more extreme than the last, until his skin turned beet red. He cursed and said, “You two-faced
coward! How could you look me in the eye and speak to me like an honest man while, at the same time,
courting my daughter without permission? I dealt with you in good faith, and here I find you plundering

Page 424

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

my house while my back is turned.”
“I had hoped to do this properly,” said Roran, “but events have con-spired against me. It was never my
intention to cause you grief. Even though this hasn’t gone the way either of us wanted, I still want your
blessing, if you are willing.”
“I would rather have a maggot-riddled pig for a son than you! You have no farm. You have no family.
And you will have naught to do with my daughter!” The butcher cursed again. “And she’ll have naught to
do with the Spine!”
Sloan reached for Katrina, but Roran blocked the way, his face as hard as his clenched fists. Only a
handsbreadth apart, they stared directly at each other, trembling from the strength of their emotions.
Sloan’s red-rimmed eyes shone with manic intensity.
“Katrina, come here,” Sloan commanded.
Roran withdrew from Sloan—so that the three of them formed a trian-gle—and looked at Katrina.
Tears streamed down her face as she glanced between him and her father. She stepped forward,
hesitated, then with a long, anguished cry, tore at her hair in a frenzy of indecision.
“Katrina!” exclaimed Sloan with a burr of fear.
“Katrina,” murmured Roran.
At the sound of his voice, Katrina’s tears ceased and she stood straight and tall with a calm expression.
She said, “I’m sorry, Father, but I have decided to marry Roran,” and stepped to his side.
Sloan turned bone white. He bit his lip so hard that a bead of ruby blood appeared. “You can’t leave
me! You’re my daughter!” He lunged at her with crooked hands. In that instant, Roran bellowed and
struck the butcher with all his strength, knocking him sprawling in the dirt before the entire village.
Sloan rose slowly, his face and neck flushed with humiliation. When he saw Katrina again, the butcher
seemed to crumple inward, losing height and stature until Roran felt as if he were looking at a specter of
the origi-nal man. In a low whisper, he said, “It is always so; those closest to the heart cause the most
pain. Thou will have no dowry from me, snake, nor your mother’s inheritance.” Weeping bitterly, Sloan
turned and fled to-ward his shop.
Katrina leaned against Roran, and he put an arm around her. Together they clung to each other as
people crowded against them offering condo-lences, advice, congratulations, and disapproval. Despite
the commotion, Roran was aware of nothing but the woman whom he held, and who held him.
Just then, Elain bustled up as fast as her pregnancy would allow. “Oh, you poor dear!” she cried, and
embraced Katrina, drawing her from Ro-ran’s arms. “Is it true you are engaged?” Katrina nodded and
smiled, then erupted into hysterical tears against Elain’s shoulder. “There now, there now.” Elain cradled
Katrina gently, petting her and trying to soothe her, but without avail—every time Roran thought she was
about to recover, Katrina began to cry with renewed intensity. Finally, Elain peered over Katrina’s
quaking shoulder and said, “I’m taking her back to the house.”
“I’ll come.”
“No, you won’t,” retorted Elain. “She needs time to calm down, and you have work to do. Do you want

Page 425

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

my advice?” Roran nodded dumbly. “Stay away until evening. I guarantee that she will be as right as rain
by then. She can join the others tomorrow.” Without waiting for his response, Elain escorted the sobbing
Katrina away from the wall of sharpened trees.
Roran stood with his hands hanging limply by his sides, feeling dazed and helpless. What have we
done? He regretted that he had not revealed their engagement to Sloan sooner. He regretted that he and
Sloan could not work together to shield Katrina from the Empire. And he regretted that Katrina had been
forced to relinquish her only family for him. He was now doubly responsible for her welfare. They had no
choice but to get married. I’ve made a terrible mess of this. He sighed and clenched his fist, wincing as
his bruised knuckles stretched.
“How are you?” asked Baldor, coming alongside him.
Roran forced a smile. “It didn’t turn out quite how I hoped. Sloan’s be-yond reason when it comes to
the Spine.”
“And Katrina.”
“That too. I—” Roran fell silent as Loring stopped before them.
“That was a blasted fool thing to do!” growled the shoemaker, wrinkling his nose. Then he stuck out his
chin, grinned, and bared his stumps of teeth. “But I ’ope you and the girl have the best of luck.” He
shook his head. “Heh, you’re going to need it, Stronghammer!”
“We’re all going to need it,” snapped Thane as he walked past.
Loring waved a hand. “Bah, sourpuss. Listen, Roran; I’ve lived in Carva-hall for many, many years, and
in my experience, it’s better that this hap-pened now, instead of when we’re all warm and cozy.”
Baldor nodded, but Roran asked, “Why so?”
“Isn’t it obvious? Normally, you and Katrina would be the meat of gos-sip for the next nine months.”
Loring put a finger on the side of his nose. “Ah, but this way, you’ll soon be forgotten amid everything
else that’s go-ing on, and then the two of you might even have some peace.”
Roran frowned. “I’d rather be talked about than have those desecrators camped on the road.”
“So would we all. Still, it’s something to be grateful for, and we all need something to be grateful
for—’specially once you’re married!” Loring cackled and pointed at Roran. “Your face just turned
purple, boy!”
Roran grunted and set about gathering Katrina’s possessions off the ground. As he did, he was
interrupted by comments from whoever hap-pened to be nearby, none of which helped to settle his
nerves. “Rotgut,” he muttered to himself after a particularly invidious remark.
Although the expedition into the Spine was delayed by the unusual scene the villagers had just witnessed,
it was only slightly after midmorn-ing when the caravan of people and donkeys began to ascend the bare
trail scratched into the side of Narnmor Mountain to the crest of the Igualda Falls. It was a steep climb
and had to be taken slowly, on account of the children and the size of the burdens everyone carried.
Roran spent most of his time caught behind Calitha—Thane’s wife— and her five children. He did not

Page 426

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

mind, as it gave him an opportunity to indulge his injured calf and to consider recent events at length. He
was disturbed by his confrontation with Sloan. At least, he consoled himself, Katrina won’t remain in
Carvahall much longer. For Roran was convinced, in his heart of hearts, that the village would soon be
defeated. It was a sobering, yet unavoidable, realization.
He paused to rest three-quarters of the way up the mountain and leaned against a tree as he admired the
elevated view of Palancar Valley. He tried to spot the Ra’zac’s camp—which he knew was just to the
left of the Anora River and the road south—but was unable to discern even a wisp of smoke.
Roran heard the roar of the Igualda Falls long before they came into sight. The falls appeared for all the
world like a great snowy mane that billowed and drifted off Narnmor’s craggy head to the valley floor a
half mile below. The massive stream curved in several directions as it fell, the result of different layers of
wind.
Past the slate ledge where the Anora River became airborne, down a glen filled with thimbleberries, and
then finally into a large clearing guarded on one side by a pile of boulders, Roran found that those at the
head of the procession had already begun setting up camp. The forest rang with the children’s shouts and
cries.
Removing his pack, Roran untied an ax from the top, then set about clearing the underbrush from the site
along with several other men. When they finished, they began chopping down enough trees to encircle the
camp. The aroma of pine sap filled the air. Roran worked quickly, the wood chips flying in unison with
his rhythmic swings.
By the time the fortifications were complete, the camp had already been erected with seventeen wool
tents, four small cookfires, and glum expressions from people and donkeys alike. No one wanted to
leave, and no one wanted to stay.
Roran surveyed the assortment of boys and old men clutching spears, and thought, Too much
experience and too little. The grandfathers know how to deal with bears and the like, but will the
grandsons have the strength to actually do it? Then he noticed the hard glint in the women’s eyes and
realized that while they might hold a babe or be busy tending a scraped arm, their own shields and spears
were never far from reach. Ro-ran smiled. Perhaps... perhaps we still have hope.
He saw Nolfavrell sitting alone on a log—staring back toward Palancar Valley—and joined the boy,
who looked at him seriously. “Are you leav-ing soon?” asked Nolfavrell. Roran nodded, impressed by
his poise and determination. “You will do your best, won’t you, to kill the Ra’zac and avenge my father?
I would do it, except that Mama says I must guard my brothers and sisters.”
“I’ll bring you their heads myself, if I can,” promised Roran.
The boy’s chin trembled. “That is good!”
“Nolfavrell...” Roran paused as he searched for the right words. “You are the only one here, besides
me, who has killed a man. It doesn’t mean that we are better or worse than anyone else, but it means that
I can trust you to fight well if you are attacked. When Katrina comes here tomorrow, will you make sure
that she’s well protected?”
Nolfavrell’s chest swelled with pride. “I’ll guard her wherever she goes!” Then he looked regretful.
“That is... when I don’t have to look after—”

Page 427

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Roran understood. “Oh, your family comes first. But maybe Katrina can stay in the tent with your
brothers and sisters.”
“Yes,” said Nolfavrell slowly. “Yes, I think that would work. You can rely on me.”
“Thank you.” Roran clapped him on the shoulder. He could have asked an older and more capable
person, but the adults were too busy with their own responsibilities to defend Katrina as he hoped.
Nolfavrell, however, would have the opportunity and inclination to assure that she remained safe. He can
hold my place while we are apart. Roran stood as Birgit approached.
Eyeing him flatly, she said, “Come, it is time.” Then she hugged her son and continued toward the falls
with Roran and the other villagers who were returning to Carvahall. Behind them, everyone in the small
camp clustered against the felled trees and stared forlornly out through their wooden bars.
HIS ENEMY’S FACE

As Roran proceeded about his work throughout the rest of the day, he felt Carvahall’s emptiness deep
inside. It was as if part of himself had been extracted and hidden in the Spine. And with the children
gone, the village now felt like an armed camp. The change seemed to have made everyone grim and
grave.
When the sun finally sank into the waiting teeth of the Spine, Roran climbed the hill to Horst’s house. He
stopped before the front door and placed a hand on the knob, but remained there, unable to enter. Why
does this frighten me as much as fighting?
In the end, he forsook the front door entirely and went to the side of the house, where he slipped into the
kitchen and, to his dismay, saw Elain knitting on one side of the table, speaking to Katrina, who was
op-posite her. They both turned toward him, and Roran blurted, “Are... are you all right?”
Katrina came to his side. “I’m fine.” She smiled softly. “It just was a ter-rible shock when Father...
when...” She ducked her head for a moment. “Elain has been wonderfully kind to me. She agreed to lend
me Baldor’s room for the night.”
“I’m glad you are better,” said Roran. He hugged her, trying to convey all of his love and adoration
through that simple touch.
Elain wrapped up her knitting. “Come now. The sun has set, and it’s time you were off to bed, Katrina.”
Roran reluctantly let go of Katrina, who kissed him on the cheek and said, “I’ll see you in the morning.”
He started to follow her out, but stopped when Elain said with a barbed tone, “Roran.” Her delicate face
was hard and stern.
“Yes?”
Elain waited until they heard the creak of stairs that indicated Katrina was out of earshot. “I hope that
you meant every promise you gave that girl, because if you didn’t, I’ll call an assembly and have you
exiled within a week.”

Roran was dumbfounded. “Of course I meant them. I love her.”
“Katrina just surrendered everything she owned or cared about for you.” Elain stared up at him with
unwavering eyes. “I’ve seen men who throw their affection at young maids, like grain tossed at chickens.
The maids sigh and weep and believe that they are special, yet for the man, it’s only a trifling amusement.
You have always been honorable, Roran, but one’s loins can turn even the most sensible person into a
prancing booby or a sly, wicked fox. Are you one? For Katrina requires neither a fool, a trick-ster, nor
even love; what she requires above all else is a man who will provide for her. If you abandon her, she will
be the meanest person in Carvahall, forced to live off her friends, our first and only beggar. By the blood
in my veins, I won’t let that happen.”
“Nor would I,” protested Roran. “I would have to be heartless, or worse, to do so.”
Elain jerked her chin. “Exactly. Don’t forget that you intend to marry a woman who has lost both her
dowry and her mother’s inheritance. Do you understand what it means for Katrina to lose her
inheritance? She has no silver, no linens, no lace, nor any of the things needed for a well-run home. Such
items are all we own, passed from mother to daughter since the day we first settled Alagaësia. They
determine our worth. A woman without her inheritance is like... is like—”
“Is like a man without a farm or a trade,” said Roran.
“Just so. It was cruel of Sloan to deny Katrina her inheritance, but that can’t be helped now. Both you
and she have no money or resources. Life is difficult enough without that added hardship. You’ll be
starting from nothing and with nothing. Does the prospect frighten you or seem un-bearable? So I ask
you once again—and don’t lie or the two of you will regret it for the rest of your lives—will you care for
her without grudge or resentment?”
“Yes.”
Elain sighed and filled two earthen cups with cider from a jug hanging among the rafters. She handed one
to Roran as she seated herself back at the table. “Then I suggest that you devote yourself to replacing
Katrina’s home and inheritance so that she and any daughters you may have can stand without shame
among the wives of Carvahall.”
Roran sipped the cool cider. “If we live that long.”
“Aye.” She brushed back a strand of her blond hair and shook her head. “You’ve chosen a hard path,
Roran.”
“I had to make sure that Katrina would leave Carvahall.”
Elain lifted an eyebrow. “So that was it. Well, I won’t argue about it, but why on earth didn’t you speak
to Sloan about your engagement be-fore this morning? When Horst asked my father, he gave our family
twelve sheep, a sow, and eight pairs of wrought-iron candlesticks before he even knew if my parents
would agree. That’s how it should be done. Surely you could have thought of a better strategy than
striking your fa-ther-in-law-to-be.”
A painful laugh escaped Roran. “I could have, but it never seemed the right time with all the attacks.”
“The Ra’zac haven’t attacked for almost six days now.”

Page 429

He scowled. “No, but... it was... Oh, I don’t know!” He banged his fist on the table with frustration.
Elain put down her cup and wrapped her tiny hands around his. “If you can mend this rift between you
and Sloan now, before years of resent-ment accumulate, your life with Katrina will be much, much
easier. To-morrow morning you should go to his house and beg his forgiveness.”
“I won’t beg! Not to him.”
“Roran, listen to me. It’s worth a month of begging to have peace in your family. I know from
experience; strife does naught but make you miserable.”
“Sloan hates the Spine. He’ll have nothing to do with me.”
“You have to try, though,” said Elain earnestly. “Even if he spurns your apology, at least you can’t be
blamed for not making the effort. If you love Katrina, then swallow your pride and do what’s right for
her. Don’t make her suffer for your mistake.” She finished her cider, used a tin hat to snuff the candles,
and left Roran sitting alone in the dark.
Several minutes elapsed before Roran could bring himself to stir. He stretched out an arm and traced
along the counter’s edge until he felt the doorway, then proceeded upstairs, all the while running the tips
of his fingers over the carved walls to keep his balance. In his room, he disrobed and threw himself
lengthwise on the bed.
Wrapping his arms around his wool-stuffed pillow, Roran listened to the faint sounds that drifted through
the house at night: the scrabble of a mouse in the attic and its intermittent squeaks, the groan of wood
beams cooling in the night, the whisper and caress of wind at the lintel of his window, and... and the rustle
of slippers in the hall outside his room.
He watched as the latch above the doorknob was pulled free of its hook, then the door inched forward
with a rasp of protest. It paused. A dark form slipped inside, the door closed, and Roran felt a curtain of
hair brush his face along with lips like rose petals. He sighed.
Katrina.
A thunderclap tore Roran from sleep.
Light flared on his face as he struggled to regain awareness, like a diver desperate to reach the surface.
He opened his eyes and saw a jagged hole blasted through his door. Six soldiers rushed through the
yawning cleft, followed by the two Ra’zac, who seemed to fill the room with their ghastly presence. A
sword was pressed against Roran’s neck. Beside him, Katrina screamed and pulled the blankets around
her.
“Up,”ordered the Ra’zac. Roran cautiously got to his feet. His heart felt like it was about to explode in
his chest. “Tie his handsss and bring him.”
As a soldier approached Roran with rope, Katrina screamed again and jumped on the men, biting and
clawing furiously. Her sharp nails fur-rowed their faces, drawing streams of blood that blinded the cursing
sol-diers.
Roran dropped to one knee and grabbed his hammer from the floor, then planted his feet, swinging the
hammer over his head and roaring like a bear. The soldiers threw themselves at him in an attempt to

Page 430

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

subdue him through sheer numbers, but to no avail: Katrina was in danger, and he was invincible. Shields
crumpled beneath his blows, brigandines and mail split under his merciless weapon, and helmets caved in.
Two men were wounded, and three fell to rise no more.
The clang and clamor had roused the household; Roran dimly heard Horst and his sons shouting in the
hall. The Ra’zac hissed to one another, then scuttled forward and grasped Katrina with inhuman strength,
lifting her off the floor as they fled the room.
“Roran!”she shrieked.
Summoning his energy, Roran bowled past the two remaining men. He stumbled into the hall and saw
the Ra’zac climbing out a window. Roran dashed toward them and struck at the last Ra’zac, just as it
was about to descend below the windowsill. Jerking upward, the Ra’zac caught Roran’s wrist in midair
and chittered with delight, blowing its fetid breath onto his face. “Yesss! You are the one we want!”
Roran tried to twist free, but the Ra’zac did not budge. With his free hand, Roran buffeted the creature’s
head and shoulders—which were as hard as iron. Desperate and enraged, he seized the edge of the
Ra’zac’s hood and wrenched it back, exposing its features.
A hideous, tortured face screamed at him. The skin was shiny black, like a beetle carapace. The head
was bald. Each lidless eye was the size of his fist and gleamed like an orb of polished hematite; no iris or
pupil ex-isted. In place of a nose, mouth, and chin, a thick beak hooked to a sharp point that clacked
over a barbed purple tongue.
Roran yelled and jammed his heels against the sides of the window frame, struggling to free himself from
the monstrosity, but the Ra’zac in-exorably drew him out of the house. He could see Katrina on the
ground, still screaming and fighting.
Just as Roran’s knees buckled, Horst appeared by his side and wrapped a knotted arm around his
chest, locking him in place. “Someone get a spear!” shouted the smith. He snarled, veins bulging on his
neck from the strain of holding Roran. “It’ll take more than this demon spawn to best us!”
The Ra’zac gave a final yank, then, when it failed to dislodge Roran, cocked its head and said, “You
are oursss!” It lunged forward with blind-ing speed, and Roran howled as he felt the Ra’zac’s beak close
on his right shoulder, snipping through the front of the muscle. His wrist cracked at the same time. With a
malicious cackle, the Ra’zac released him and fell backward into the night.
Horst and Roran sprawled against each other in the hallway. “They have Katrina,” groaned Roran. His
vision flickered and went black around the edges as he pushed himself upright on his left arm—his right
hung useless. Albriech and Baldor emerged from his room, splattered with gore. Only corpses remained
behind them. Now I have killed eight. Roran retrieved his hammer and staggered down the hall, finding
his way blocked by Elain in her white sleeping shift.
She looked at him with wide eyes, then took his arm and pushed him down onto a wood chest set
against the wall. “You have to see Gertrude.”
“But—”
“You’ll pass out if this bleeding isn’t stopped.”
He looked down at his right side; it was drenched in crimson. “We have to rescue Katrina before”—he

Page 431

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

clenched his teeth as the pain surged— “before they do anything to her.”
“He’s right; we can’t wait,” said Horst, looming over them. “Bind him up as best you can, then we’ll go.”
Elain pursed her lips and hurried to the linen closet. She returned with several rags, which she wrapped
tightly around Roran’s torn shoulder and his fractured wrist. Meanwhile, Al-briech and Baldor scavenged
armor and swords from the soldiers. Horst contented himself with just a spear.
Elain put her hands on Horst’s chest and said, “Be careful.” She looked at her sons. “All of you.”
“We’ll be fine, Mother,” promised Albriech. She forced a smile and kissed them on the cheek.
They left the house and ran to the edge of Carvahall, where they found that the wall of trees had been
pulled open and the watchman, Byrd, slain. Baldor knelt and examined the body, then said with a choked
voice, “He was stabbed from behind.” Roran barely heard him through the pounding in his ears. Dizzy, he
leaned against a house and panted for breath.
“Ho! Who goes?”
From their stations along Carvahall’s perimeter, the other watchmen congregated around their murdered
compatriot, forming a huddle of shuttered lanterns. In hushed tones, Horst described the attack and
Katrina’s plight. “Who will help us?” he asked. After a quick discussion, five men agreed to accompany
them; the rest would remain to guard the breach in the wall and rouse the villagers.
Pushing himself off the house, Roran trotted to the head of the group as it slipped through the fields and
down the valley toward the Ra’zac’s camp. Every step was agony, yet it did not matter; nothing mattered
ex-cept Katrina. He stumbled once and Horst wordlessly caught him.
Half a mile from Carvahall, Ivor spotted a sentry on a hillock, which compelled them to make a wide
detour. A few hundred yards beyond, the ruddy glow of torches became visible. Roran raised his good
arm to slow their advance, then began to dodge and crawl through the tangled grass, startling a
jackrabbit. The men followed Roran’s lead as he worked his way to the edge of a grove of cattails,
where he stopped and parted the curtain of stalks to observe the thirteen remaining soldiers.
Where is she?
In contrast to when they had first arrived, the soldiers appeared sullen and haggard, their weapons
nicked and their armor dented. Most of them wore bandages that were rusty with splotches of dried
blood. The men were clumped together, facing the two Ra’zac—both of whom were now
hooded—across a low fire.
One man was shouting: “... over half of us killed by a bunch of inbred, cockle-brained woodrats that
can’t tell a pike from a poleax or find the point of a sword even if it’s lodged in their gut, because you
don’t have half the sense my banner boy does! I don’t care if Galbatorix himself licks your boots clean,
we won’t do a thing until we have a new commander.” The men nodded. “One who’s human. ”
“Really?” demanded the Ra’zac softly.
“We’ve had enough taking orders from hunchbacks like you, with all your clicking and teapot
whistling—makes us sick! And I don’t know what you did with Sardson, but if you stay another night,
we’ll put steel in you and find out if you bleed like us. You can leave the girl, though, she’ll be—”

Page 432

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

The man did not get a chance to continue, for the largest Ra’zac jumped across the fire and landed on
his shoulders, like a giant crow. Screaming, the soldier collapsed under the weight. He tried to draw his
sword, but the Ra’zac pecked twice at his neck with its hidden beak, and he was still.
“We have to fight that ?” muttered Ivor behind Roran.
The soldiers remained frozen with shock as the two Ra’zac lapped from the neck of the corpse. When
the black creatures rose, they rubbed their knobby hands together, as if they were washing, and said,
“Yesss. We will go. Stay if you wisssh; reinforsssements are only daysss away.” The Ra’zac threw back
their heads and began to shriek at the sky, the wail becoming increasingly shrill until it passed from
hearing.
Roran looked up as well. At first he saw nothing, but then a nameless terror gripped him as two barbed
shadows appeared high over the Spine, eclipsing the stars. They advanced quickly, growing larger and
larger until they obscured half the sky with their ominous presence. A foul wind rushed across the land,
bringing with it a sulfurous miasma that made Ro-ran cough and gag.
The soldiers were likewise afflicted; their curses echoed as they pressed sleeves and scarves over their
noses.
Above them, the shadows paused and then began to drift downward, enclosing the camp in a dome of
menacing darkness. The sickly torches flickered and threatened to extinguish themselves, yet they still
provided sufficient light to reveal the two beasts descending among the tents.
Their bodies were naked and hairless—like newborn mice—with leathery gray skin pulled tight across
their corded chests and bellies. In form they resembled starved dogs, except that their hind legs bulged
with enough muscle to crush a boulder. A narrow crest extended from the back of each of their
attenuated heads, opposite a long, straight, eb-ony beak made for spearing prey, and cold, bulbous eyes
identical to the Ra’zac’s. From their shoulders and backs sprang huge wings that made the air moan
under their weight.
Flinging themselves to the ground, the soldiers cowered and hid their faces from the monsters. A terrible,
alien intelligence emanated from the creatures, bespeaking a race far older and far more powerful than
hu-mans. Roran was suddenly afraid that his mission might fail. Behind him, Horst whispered to the men,
urging them to hold their ground and re-main hidden, else they would be slain.
The Ra’zac bowed to the beasts, then slipped into a tent and returned carrying Katrina—who was
bound with ropes—and leading Sloan. The butcher walked freely.
Roran stared, unable to comprehend how Sloan had been captured. His house isn’t anywhere near
Horst’s. Then it struck him. “He betrayed us,” said Roran with wonder. His fist slowly tightened on his
hammer as the true horror of the situation exploded within him. ” He killed Byrd and he betrayed us!”
Tears of rage streamed down his face.
“Roran,” murmured Horst, crouching beside him. “We can’t attack now; they’d slaughter us. Roran...
do you hear me?”
He heard but a whisper in the distance as he watched the smaller Ra’zac jump onto one beast above the
shoulders, then catch Katrina as the other Ra’zac tossed her up. Sloan seemed upset and frightened now.
He began arguing with the Ra’zac, shaking his head and pointing at the ground. Finally, the Ra’zac struck
him across the mouth, knocking him unconscious. Mounting the second beast, with the butcher slung over

its shoulder, the largest Ra’zac declared, “We will return once it isss sssafe again. Kill the boy, and your
livesss are forfeit.” Then the steeds flexed their massive thighs and leaped into the sky, once again
shadows upon the field of stars.
No words or emotions were left to Roran. He was utterly destroyed. All that remained was to kill the
soldiers. He stood and raised his ham-mer in preparation to charge, but as he stepped forward, his head
throbbed in unison with his wounded shoulder, the ground vanished in a burst of light, and he toppled into
oblivion.
ARROW TO THE HEART

Every day since leaving the outpost of Ceris was a hazy dream of warm afternoons spent paddling up
Eldor Lake and then the Gaena River. All around them, water gurgled through the tunnel of verdant pines
that wound ever deeper into Du Weldenvarden.
Eragon found traveling with the elves delightful. Narí and Lifaen were perpetually smiling, laughing, and
singing songs, especially when Saphira was around. They rarely looked elsewhere or spoke of another
subject but her in her presence.
However, the elves were not human, no matter the similarity of ap-pearance. They moved too quickly,
too fluidly, for creatures born of sim-ple flesh and blood. And when they spoke, they often used
roundabout expressions and aphorisms that left Eragon more confused than when they began. In between
their bursts of merriment, Lifaen and Narí would remain silent for hours, observing their surroundings with
a glow of peaceful rapture on their faces. If Eragon or Orik attempted to talk with them during their
contemplation, they would receive only a word or two in response.
It made Eragon appreciate how direct and forthright Arya was by com-parison. In fact, she seemed
uneasy around Lifaen and Narí, as if she were no longer sure how to behave with her own kind.
From the prow of the canoe, Lifaen looked over his shoulder and said, “Tell me, Eragon-finiarel.... What
do your people sing about in these dark days? I remember the epics and lays I heard in Ilirea—sagas of
your proud kings and earls—but it was long, long ago and the memories are like withered flowers in my
mind. What new works have your people cre-ated?” Eragon frowned as he tried to recall the names of
stories Brom had recited. When Lifaen heard them, he shook his head sorrowfully and said, “So much
has been lost. No court ballads survive, and, if you speak truly, nor does most of your history or art,
except for fanciful tales Galbatorix has allowed to thrive.”
“Brom once told us about the fall of the Riders,” said Eragon defen-sively. An image of a deer bounding
over rotting logs flashed behind his eyes from Saphira, who was off hunting.
“Ah, a brave man.” For a minute, Lifaen paddled silently. “We too sing about the Fall... but rarely. Most
of us were alive when Vrael entered the void, and we still grieve for our burned cities—the red lilies of
Éwayëna, the crystals of Luthivíra—and for our slain families. Time cannot dull the pain of those wounds,
not if a thousand thousand years pass and the sun itself dies, leaving the world to float in eternal night.”
Orik grunted in the back. “As it is with the dwarves. Remember, elf, we lost an entire clan to
Galbatorix.”
“And we lost our king, Evandar.”

Page 434

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“I never heard that,” said Eragon, surprised.
Lifaen nodded as he guided them around a submerged rock. “Few have. Brom could have told you
about it; he was there when the fatal blow was struck. Before Vrael’s death, the elves faced Galbatorix
on the plains of Ilirea in our final attempt to defeat him. There Evandar—”
“Where is Ilirea?” asked Eragon.
“It’s Urû’baen, boy,” said Orik. “Used to be an elf city.”
Unperturbed by the interruption, Lifaen continued: “As you say, Ilirea was one of our cities. We
abandoned it during our war with the dragons, and then, centuries later, humans adopted it as their capital
after King Palancar was exiled.”
Eragon said, “King Palancar? Who was he? Is that how Palancar Valley got its name?”
This time the elf turned and looked at him with amusement. “You have as many questions as leaves on a
tree, Argetlam.”
“Brom was of the same opinion.”
Lifaen smiled, then paused, as if to gather his thoughts. “When your an-cestors arrived in Alagaësia eight
hundred years ago, they roamed far across it, seeking a suitable place to live. Eventually, they settled in
Palan-car Valley—though it was not called such then—as it was one of the few defendable locations that
we or the dwarves had not claimed. There your king, Palancar, began to build a mighty state.
“In an attempt to expand his borders, he declared war against us, though we had offered no
provocation. Three times he attacked, and three times we prevailed. Our strength frightened Palancar’s
nobles and they pled with their liege for peace. He ignored their counsel. Then the lords approached us
with a treaty, which we signed without the king’s knowledge.
“With our help, Palancar was usurped and banished, but he, his family, and their vassals refused to leave
the valley. Since we had no wish to murder them, we constructed the tower of Ristvak’baen so the
Riders could watch over Palancar and ensure he would never again rise to power or attack anyone else
in Alagaësia.
“Before long Palancar was killed by a son who did not wish to wait for nature to take its course.
Thereafter, family politics consisted of assassina-tion, betrayal, and other depravities, reducing Palancar’s
house to a shadow of its former grandeur. However, his descendants never left, and the blood of kings
still runs in Therinsford and Carvahall.”
“I see,” said Eragon.
Lifaen lifted one dark eyebrow. “Do you? It has more significance than you may think. It was this event
that convinced Anurin—Vrael’s prede-cessor as head Rider—to allow humans to become Riders, in
order to prevent similar disputes.”
Orik emitted a bark of laughter. “That must have caused some argu-ment.”
“It was an unpopular decision,” admitted Lifaen. “Even now some ques-tion the wisdom of it. It caused

Page 435

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

such a disagreement between Anurin and Queen Dellanir that Anurin seceded from our government and
estab-lished the Riders on Vroengard as an independent entity.”
“But if the Riders were separated from your government, then how could they keep the peace, as they
were supposed to?” asked Eragon.
“They couldn’t,” said Lifaen. “Not until Queen Dellanir saw the wisdom of having the Riders free of any
lord or king and restored their access to Du Weldenvarden. Still, it never pleased her that any authority
could su-persede her own.”
Eragon frowned. “Wasn’t that the whole point, though?”
“Yes... and no. The Riders were supposed to guard against the failings of the different governments and
races, yet who watched the watchers? It was that very problem that caused the Fall. No one existed who
could descry the flaws within the Riders’ own system, for they were above scrutiny, and thus, they
perished.”
Eragon stroked the water—first on one side and then the other—while he considered Lifaen’s words.
His paddle fluttered in his hands as it cut diagonally across the current. “Who succeeded Dellanir as king
or queen?”
“Evandar did. He took the knotted throne five hundred years ago— when Dellanir abdicated in order to
study the mysteries of magic—and held it until his death. Now his mate, Islanzadí, rules us.”
“That’s—” Eragon stopped with his mouth open. He was going to say impossible, but then realized how
ridiculous the statement would sound. Instead, he asked, “Are elves immortal?”
In a soft voice, Lifaen said, “Once we were like you, bright, fleeting, and as ephemeral as the morning
dew. Now our lives stretch endlessly through the dusty years. Aye, we are immortal, although we are still
vul-nerable to injuries of the flesh.”
“You became immortal? How?” The elf refused to elaborate, though Er-agon pressed him for details.
Finally, Eragon asked, “How old is Arya?”
Lifaen turned his glittering eyes on him, probing Eragon with discon-certing acuteness. “Arya? What is
your interest in her?”
“I...” Eragon faltered, suddenly unsure of his intentions. His attraction to Arya was complicated by the
fact that she was an elf, and that her age, whatever it might be, was so much greater than his own. She
must view me as a child. “I don’t know,” he said honestly. “But she saved both my life and Saphira’s,
and I’m curious to know more about her.”
“I feel ashamed,” said Lifaen, pronouncing each word carefully, “for ask-ing such a question. Among our
kind, it is rude to pry into one’s affairs.... Only, I must say, and I believe that Orik agrees with me, that
you would do well to guard your heart, Argetlam. Now is not the time to lose it, nor would it be well
placed in this instance.”
“Aye,” grunted Orik.
Heat suffused Eragon as blood rushed to his face, like hot tallow melt-ing through him. Before he could
utter a retort, Saphira entered his mind and said, And now is the time to guard your tongue. They

Page 436

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

mean well. Don’t insult them.
He took a deep breath and tried to let his embarrassment drain away.
Do you agree with them?
I believe, Eragon, that you are full of love and that you are looking for one who will reciprocate your
affection. No shame exists in that.
He struggled to digest her words, then finally said, Will you be back soon?
I’m on my way now.
Returning his attention to his surroundings, Eragon found that both the elf and the dwarf were watching
him. “I understand your concern... and I’d still like my question answered.”
Lifaen hesitated briefly. “Arya is quite young. She was born a year be-fore the destruction of the
Riders.”
A hundred!Though he had expected such a figure, Eragon was still shocked. He concealed it behind a
blank face, thinking, She could have great-grandchildren older than me! He brooded on the subject
for several minutes and then, to distract himself, said, “You mentioned that humans discovered Alagaësia
eight hundred years ago. Yet Brom said that we ar-rived three centuries after the Riders were formed,
which was thousands of years ago.”
“Two thousand, seven hundred, and four years, by our reckoning,” de-clared Orik. “Brom was right, if
you consider a single ship with twenty warriors the ‘arrival’ of humans in Alagaësia. They landed in the
south, where Surda is now. We met while they were exploring and exchanged gifts, but then they
departed and we didn’t see another human for almost two millennia, or until King Palancar arrived with a
fleet in tow. The humans had completely forgotten us by then, except for vague stories about hairy
men-of-the-mountains that preyed on children in the night. Bah!”
“Do you know where Palancar came from?” asked Eragon.
Orik frowned and gnawed the tip of his mustache, then shook his head. “Our histories only say that his
homeland was far to the south, beyond the Beors, and that his exodus was the result of war and famine.”
Excited by an idea, Eragon blurted, “So there might be countries elsewhere that could help us against
Galbatorix.”
“Possibly,” said Orik. “But they would be difficult to find, even on dragonback, and I doubt that you’d
speak the same language. Who would want to help us, though? The Varden have little to offer another
country, and it’s hard enough to get an army from Farthen Dûr to Urû’baen, much less bring forces from
hundreds, if not thousands, of miles away.”
“We could not spare you anyway,” said Lifaen to Eragon.
“I still—” Eragon broke off as Saphira soared over the river, followed by a furious crowd of sparrows
and blackbirds intent on driving her away from their nests. At the same time, a chorus of squeaks and
chatters burst from the armies of squirrels hidden among the branches.

Page 437

Lifaen beamed and cried, “Isn’t she glorious? See how her scales catch the light! No treasure in the
world can match this sight.” Similar exclama-tions floated across the river from Narí.
“Bloody unbearable, that’s what it is,” muttered Orik into his beard. Er-agon hid a smile, though he
agreed with the dwarf. The elves never seemed to tire of praising Saphira.
Nothing’s wrong with a few compliments,said Saphira. She landed with a gigantic splash and submerged
her head to escape a diving sparrow.
Of course not,said Eragon.
Saphira eyed him from underwater. Was that sarcasm?
He chuckled and let it pass. Glancing at the other boat, Eragon watched Arya paddle, her back perfectly
straight, her face inscrutable as she floated through webs of mottled light beneath the mossy trees. She
seemed so dark and somber, it made him want to comfort her. “Lifaen,” he asked softly so that Orik
would not hear, “why is Arya so... unhappy? You and—”
Lifaen’s shoulders stiffened underneath his russet tunic and he whis-pered, so low that Eragon could
barely hear, “We are honored to serve Arya Dröttningu. She has suffered more than you can imagine for
our people. We celebrate out of joy for what she has achieved with Saphira, and we weep in our dreams
for her sacrifice... and her loss. Her sorrows are her own, though, and I cannot reveal them without her
permission.”
As Eragon sat by their nightly campfire, petting a swatch of moss that felt like rabbit fur, he heard a
commotion deeper in the forest. Exchang-ing glances with Saphira and Orik, he crept toward the sound,
drawing Zar’roc.
Eragon stopped at the lip of a small ravine and looked across to the other side, where a gyrfalcon with a
broken wing thrashed in a bed of snowberries. The raptor froze when it saw him, then opened its beak
and uttered a piercing screech.
What a terrible fate, to be unable to fly,said Saphira.
When Arya arrived, she eyed the gyrfalcon, then strung her bow and, with unerring aim, shot it through
the breast. At first Eragon thought that she had done it for food, but she made no move to retrieve either
the bird or her arrow.
“Why?” he asked.
With a hard expression, Arya unstrung her bow. “It was too injured for me to heal and would have died
tonight or tomorrow. Such is the nature of things. I saved it hours of suffering.”
Saphira lowered her head and touched Arya on the shoulder with her snout, then returned to their camp,
her tail scraping bark off the trees. As Eragon started to follow, he felt Orik tug his sleeve and bent down
to hear the dwarf say in an undertone, “Never ask an elf for help; they might decide that you’re better off
dead, eh?”
THE DAGSHELGR INVOCATION

Though he was tired from the previous day, Eragon forced himself to rise before dawn in an attempt to
catch one of the elves asleep. It had become a game with him to discover when the elves got up—or if
they slept at all—as he had yet to see any of them with their eyes closed. To-day was no exception.
“Good morning,” said Narí and Lifaen from above him. Eragon craned back his head and saw that they
each stood on the bough of a pine tree, over fifty feet in the air. Jumping from branch to branch with
feline grace, the elves dropped to the ground alongside him.
“We have been keeping watch,” explained Lifaen.
“For what?”
Arya stepped around a tree and said, “For my fears. Du Weldenvarden has many mysteries and
dangers, especially for a Rider. We have lived here for thousands of years, and old spells still linger in
unexpected places; magic permeates the air, the water, and the earth. In places it has affected the
animals. Sometimes strange creatures are found roaming the forest, and not all of them friendly.”
“Are they—” Eragon stopped as his gedwëy ignasia tingled. The silver hammer on the necklace Gannel
had given him grew hot on his chest, and he felt the amulet’s spell draw upon his strength.
Someone was trying to scry him.
Is it Galbatorix?he wondered, frightened. He clutched the necklace and pulled it out of his tunic, ready to
yank it off should he become too weak. From the other side of the camp, Saphira rushed to his side,
bol-stering him with her own reserves of energy.
A moment later, the heat leached out of the hammer, leaving it cold against Eragon’s skin. He bounced it
on his palm, then tucked it back un-der his clothes, whereupon Saphira said, Our enemies are
searching for us.
Enemies? Could not it be someone in Du Vrangr Gata?
I think Hrothgar would have told Nasuada that he ordered Gannel to en-chant you this necklace.... She
might have even come up with the idea in the first place.
Arya frowned when Eragon explained what had occurred. “This makes it all the more important we
reach Ellesméra quickly so your training can resume. Events in Alagaësia move apace, and I fear you
won’t have ade-quate time for your studies.”
Eragon wanted to discuss it further, but lost the opportunity in the rush to leave camp. Once the canoes
were loaded and the fire tamped out, they continued to forge up the Gaena River.
They had only been on the water for an hour when Eragon noticed that the river was growing wider and
deeper. A few minutes later, they came upon a waterfall that filled Du Weldenvarden with its throbbing
rumble. The cataract was about a hundred feet tall, and streamed down a stone face with an overhang
that made it impossible to climb. “How do we get past that?” He could already feel cool spray on his
face.
Lifaen pointed at the left shore, some distance from the falls, where a trail had been worn up the steep
ridge. “We have to portage our canoes and supplies for half a league before the river clears.”

Page 439

The five of them untied the bundles wedged between the seats of the canoes and divided the supplies
into piles that they stuffed into their packs. “Ugh,” said Eragon, hefting his load. It was twice as heavy as
what he usually carried when traveling on foot.
I could fly it upstream for you... all of it,offered Saphira, crawling onto the muddy bank and shaking
herself dry.
When Eragon repeated her suggestion, Lifaen looked horrified. “We would never dream of using a
dragon as a beast of burden. It would dis-honor you, Saphira—and Eragon as Shur’tugal—and it would
shame our hospitality.”
Saphira snorted, and a plume of flame erupted from her nostrils, vapor-izing the surface of the river and
creating a cloud of steam. This is non-sense. Reaching past Eragon with one scaly leg, she hooked her
talons through the packs’ shoulder straps, then took off over their heads. Catch me if you can!
A peal of clear laughter broke the silence, like the trill of a mocking-bird. Amazed, Eragon turned and
looked at Arya. It was the first time he had ever heard her laugh; he loved the sound. She smiled at
Lifaen. “You have much to learn if you presume to tell a dragon what she may or may not do.”
“But the dishonor—”
“It is no dishonor if Saphira does it of her free will,” asserted Arya. “Now, let us go before we waste
any more time.”
Hoping that the strain would not trigger the pain in his back, Eragon picked up his canoe with Lifaen and
fit it over his shoulders. He was forced to rely on the elf to guide him along the trail, as he could only see
the ground beneath his feet.
An hour later, they had topped the ridge and hiked beyond the danger-ous white water to where the
Gaena River was once again calm and glassy. Waiting for them was Saphira, who was busy catching fish
in the shallows, jabbing her triangular head into the water like a heron.
Arya called her over and said to both her and Eragon, “Beyond the next curve lies Ardwen Lake and,
upon its western shore, Sílthrim, one of our greatest cities. Past that, a vast expanse of forest still
separates us from Ellesméra. We will encounter many elves close to Sílthrim. However, I don’t want
either of you to be seen until we speak with Queen Islanzadí.”
Why?asked Saphira, echoing Eragon’s thoughts.
In her musical accent, Arya answered: “Your presence represents a great and terrible change for our
kingdom, and such shifts are dangerous unless handled with care. The queen must be the first to meet
with you. Only she has the authority and wisdom to oversee this transition.”
“You speak highly of her,” commented Eragon.
At his words, Narí and Lifaen stopped and watched Arya with guarded eyes. Her face went blank, then
she drew herself up proudly. “She has led us well.... Eragon, I know you carry a hooded cape from
Tronjheim. Until we are free of possible observers, will you wear it and keep your head covered so that
none can see your rounded ears and know that you are human?” He nodded. “And, Saphira, you must
hide during the day and catch up with us at night. Ajihad told me that is what you did in the Empire.”

And I hated every moment of it,she growled.
“It’s only for today and tomorrow. After that we will be far enough away from Sílthrim that we won’t
have to worry about encountering anyone of consequence,” promised Arya.
Saphira turned her azure eyes on Eragon. When we escaped the Empire, I swore that I would always
stay close enough to protect you. Every time I leave, bad things happen: Yazuac, Daret,
Dras-Leona, the slavers.
Not in Teirm.
You know what I mean! I’m especially loath to leave since you can’t de-fend yourself with your crippled
back.
I trust that Arya and the others will keep me safe. Don’t you?
Saphira hesitated. I trust Arya. She twisted away and padded up the riverbank, sat for a minute, then
returned. Very well. She broadcast her acceptance to Arya, adding, But I won’t wait any longer than
tomorrow night, even if you’re in the middle of Sílthrim at the time.
“I understand,” said Arya. “You will still have to be careful when flying after dark, as elves can see
clearly on all but the blackest nights. If you are sighted by chance, you could be attacked by magic.”
Wonderful,commented Saphira.
While Orik and the elves repacked the boats, Eragon and Saphira ex-plored the dim forest, searching
for a suitable hiding place. They settled on a dry hollow rimmed by crumbling rocks and blanketed with a
bed of pine needles that were pleasantly soft underfoot. Saphira curled up on the ground and nodded her
head. Go now. I will be fine.
Eragon hugged her neck—careful to avoid her sharp spines—and then reluctantly departed, glancing
backward. At the river, he donned his cape before they resumed their journey.
The air was motionless when Ardwen Lake came into view, and as a result, the vast mantle of water
was smooth and flat, a perfect mirror for the trees and clouds. The illusion was so flawless, Eragon felt as
if he were looking through a window at another world and that if they contin-ued forward, the canoes
would fall endlessly into the reflected sky. He shivered at the thought.
In the hazy distance, numerous white birch-bark boats darted like water striders along both shores,
propelled to incredible speeds by the elves’ strength. Eragon ducked his head and tugged on the edge of
his hood to ensure that it covered his face.
His link with Saphira grew ever more tenuous the farther apart they became, until only a wisp of thought
connected them. By evening he could no longer feel her presence, even if he strained his mind to its
lim-its. All of a sudden, Du Weldenvarden seemed much more lonely and desolate.
As the gloom deepened, a cluster of white lights—placed at every con-ceivable height among the
trees—sprang into existence a mile ahead. The sparks glowed with the silver radiance of the full moon,
eerie and myste-rious in the night.

Page 441

“There lies Sílthrim,” said Lifaen.
With a faint splash, a dark boat passed them from the opposite direc-tion, accompanied by a murmur of
“Kvetha Fricai” from the elf steering.
Arya brought her canoe alongside Eragon’s. “We will stop here tonight.”
They made camp a ways from Ardwen Lake, where the ground was dry enough to sleep on. The
ferocious droves of mosquitoes forced Arya to cast a protective spell so that they could eat dinner in
relative comfort.
Afterward, the five of them sat around the fire, staring at the gold flames. Eragon leaned his head against
a tree and watched a meteor streak across the sky. His eyelids were about to sink shut when a woman’s
voice drifted through the woods from Sílthrim, a faint susurration that brushed the inside of his ear like a
down feather. He frowned and straightened, trying to better hear the tenuous whisper.
Like a thread of smoke that thickens as a newborn fire blazes to life, so the voice rose in strength until
the forest sighed with a teasing, twisting melody that leaped and fell with wild abandon. More voices
joined the unearthly song, embroidering the original theme with a hundred varia-tions. The air itself
seemed to shimmer with the fabric of the tempestu-ous music.
The fey strains sent jolts of elation and fear down Eragon’s spine; they clouded his senses, drawing him
into the velvet night. Seduced by the haunting notes, he jumped to his feet, ready to dash through the
forest until he found the source of the voices, ready to dance among the trees and moss, anything so that
he could join the elves’ revels. But before he could move, Arya caught his arm and yanked him around to
face her.
“Eragon! Clear your mind!” He struggled in a futile attempt to break her grip. “Eyddr eyreya onr!”
Empty your ears! Everything fell silent then, as if he had gone deaf. He stopped fighting and looked
around, wondering what had just occurred. On the other side of the fire, Lifaen and Narí wrestled
noiselessly with Orik.
Eragon watched Arya’s mouth move as she spoke, then sound returned to the world with a pop, though
he could no longer hear the music. “What... ?” he asked, dazed.
“Gerr’off me,” growled Orik. Lifaen and Narí lifted their hands and backed away.
“Your pardon, Orik-vodhr,” said Lifaen.
Arya gazed toward Sílthrim. “I miscounted the days; I didn’t want to be anywhere near a city during
Dagshelgr. Our saturnalias, our celebrations, are perilous for mortals. We sing in the ancient language,
and the lyrics weave spells of passion and longing that are difficult to resist, even for us.”
Narí stirred restlessly. “We should be at a grove.”
“We should,” agreed Arya, “but we will do our duty and wait.”
Shaken, Eragon sat closer to the fire, wishing for Saphira; he was sure she could have protected his
mind from the music’s influence. “What is the point of Dagshelgr?” he asked.
Arya joined him on the ground, crossing her long legs. “It is to keep the forest healthy and fertile. Every

Page 442

spring we sing for the trees, we sing for the plants, and we sing for the animals. Without us, Du
Weldenvarden would be half its size.” As if to emphasize her point, birds, deer, squir-rels—red and
gray—striped badgers, foxes, rabbits, wolves, frogs, toads, tortoises, and every other nearby animal
forsook their hiding and began to rush madly about with a cacophony of yelps and cries. “They are
search-ing for mates,” explained Arya. “All across Du Weldenvarden, in each of our cities, elves are
singing this song. The more who participate, the stronger the spell, and the greater Du Weldenvarden will
be this year.”
Eragon snatched back his hand as a trio of hedgehogs trundled past his thigh. The entire forest
yammered with noise. I’ve stepped into fairyland, he thought, hugging himself.
Orik came around the fire and raised his voice above the clamor: “By my beard and my ax, I’ll not be
controlled against my will by magic. If it happens again, Arya, I swear on Helzvog’s stone girdle that I’ll
return to Farthen Dûr and you will have the wrath of Dûrgrimst Ingeitum to deal with.”
“It was not my intention for you to experience Dagshelgr,” said Arya. “I apologize for my mistake.
However, though I am shielding you from this spell, you cannot escape magic in Du Weldenvarden; it
permeates every-thing.”
“So long as it doesn’t befoul my mind.” Orik shook his head and fin-gered the haft of his ax while eyeing
the shadowy beasts that lumbered in the gloom beyond the pool of firelight.
No one slept that night. Eragon and Orik remained awake because of the frightful din and the animals
that kept crashing by their tents, the elves because they still listened to the song. Lifaen and Narí took to
pac-ing in endless circles, while Arya stared toward Sílthrim with a hungry expression, her tawny skin
drawn thin and taut over her cheekbones.
Four hours into the riot of sound and motion, Saphira dove out of the sky, her eyes sparkling with a
queer aspect. She shivered and arched her neck, panting between her open jaws. The forest, she said, is
alive. And I am alive. My blood burns like never before. It burns as yours burns when you think of
Arya. I... understand!
Eragon put his hand on her shoulder, feeling the tremors that racked her frame; her sides vibrated as she
hummed along with the music. She gripped the ground with her ivory claws, her muscles coiled and
clenched in a supreme effort to remain motionless. The tip of her tail twitched like she was about to
pounce.
Arya stood and joined Eragon on the opposite side of Saphira. The elf also put a hand on Saphira’s
shoulder, and the three of them faced the darkness, united into a living chain.
When dawn broke, the first thing Eragon noticed was that all the trees now had buds of bright green
needles at the ends of their branches. He bent and examined the snowberries at his feet and found that
every plant, large or small, had acquired new growth during the night. The for-est vibrated with the
ripeness of its colors; everything was lush and fresh and clean. The air smelled like it had just rained.
Saphira shook herself beside Eragon and said, The fever has passed; I am myself again. Such things
I felt... It was as if the world were being born anew and I was helping to create it with the fire in
my limbs.
How are you? On the inside, I mean.

Page 443

I will need some time to understand what I experienced.
Since the music had ceased, Arya removed her spell from Eragon and Orik. She said, “Lifaen. Narí. Go
to Sílthrim and get horses for the five of us. We cannot walk all the way from here to Ellesméra. Also,
alert Cap-tain Damítha that Ceris requires reinforcements.”
Narí bowed. “And what shall we say when she asks why we have de-serted our post?”
“Tell her that that which she once hoped for—and feared—has oc-curred; the wyrm has bitten its own
tail. She will understand.”
The two elves departed for Sílthrim after the boats were emptied of supplies. Three hours later, Eragon
heard a stick snap and looked up to see them returning through the forest on proud white stallions,
leading four other identical horses. The magnificent beasts moved among the trees with uncanny stealth,
their coats shimmering in the emerald twi-light. None of them wore saddles or harnesses.
“Blöthr, blöthr,” murmured Lifaen, and his steed halted, pawing the ground with its dark hooves.
“Are all your horses as noble as these?” asked Eragon. He cautiously ap-proached one, amazed by its
beauty. The animals were only a few inches taller than ponies, which made it easy for them to navigate
among the closely placed trunks. They did not seem frightened by Saphira.
“Not all,” laughed Narí, tossing his silver hair, “but most. We have bred them for many centuries.”
“How am I supposed to ride?”
Arya said, “An elf horse responds instantly to commands in the ancient language; tell it where you wish
to go and it will take you. However, do not mistreat them with blows or harsh words, for they are not our
slaves, but our friends and partners. They bear you only so long as they consent to; it is a great privilege
to ride one. I was only able to save Saphira’s egg from Durza because our horses sensed that something
was amiss and stopped us from riding into his ambush.... They won’t let you fall unless you deliberately
throw yourself off, and they are skilled in choosing the safest, quickest path through treacherous ground.
The dwarves’ Feldûnost are like that.”
“Right you are,” grunted Orik. “A Feldûnost can run you up a cliff and down without a single bruise. But
how can we carry food and whatnot without saddles? I won’t ride while wearing a full pack.”
Lifaen tossed a pile of leather bags at Orik’s feet and indicated the sixth horse. “Nor will you have to.”
It took half an hour to arrange their supplies in the bags and heap them into a lumpy mound on the
horse’s back. Afterward, Narí told Eragon and Orik the words they could use to direct the horses: “
Gánga framto go forward, blöthrto stop, hlaupa if needs you must run, and gánga aptr to go back.
You can give more precise instructions if you know more of the ancient language.” He led Eragon to a
horse and said, “This is Folkvír. Hold out your hand.”
Eragon did, and the stallion snorted, flaring his nostrils. Folkvír sniffed Eragon’s palm, then touched it
with his muzzle and allowed Eragon to stroke his thick neck. “Good,” said Narí, appearing satisfied. The
elf had Orik do the same with the next horse.
As Eragon mounted Folkvír, Saphira drew closer. He looked up at her, noting how troubled she still
seemed from the night. One more day, he said.

Page 444

Eragon...She paused. I thought of something while I was under the influ-ence of the elves’ spell,
something that I have always considered of little consequence, but now looms within me like a
mountain of black dread: Every creature, no matter how pure or monstrous, has a mate of their
own kind. Yet I have none. She shuddered and closed her eyes. In this regard, I am alone.
Her statements reminded Eragon that she was barely more than eight months old. On most occasions,
her youth did not show—due to the in-fluence of her hereditary instincts and memories—but, in this
arena, she was even more inexperienced than he was with his feeble stabs at ro-mance in Carvahall and
Tronjheim. Pity welled inside Eragon, but he suppressed it before it could seep across their mental link.
Saphira would have only contempt for the emotion: it could neither solve her problem nor make her feel
better. Instead, he said, Galbatorix still has two dragon eggs. During our first audience with
Hrothgar, you mentioned that you would like to rescue them. If we can—
Saphira snorted bitterly. It could take years, and even if we did retrieve the eggs, I have no
guarantee that they would hatch, nor that they would be male, nor that we would be fit mates.
Fate has abandoned my race to ex-tinction. She lashed her tail with frustration, breaking a sapling in
two. She seemed perilously close to tears.
What can I say?he asked, disturbed by her distress. You can’t give up hope. You still have a chance
to find a mate, but you have to be patient. Even if Galbatorix’s eggs don’t work, dragons must
exist elsewhere in the world, just like humans, elves, and Urgals do. The moment we are free of
our obligations, I’ll help you search for them. All right?
All right,she sniffed. She craned back her head and released a puff of white smoke that dispersed among
the branches overhead. I should know better than to let my emotions get the best of me.
Nonsense. You would have to be made of stone not to feel this way. It’s perfectly normal.... But
promise you won’t dwell on it while you’re alone.
She fixed one giant sapphire eye on him. I won’t. He turned warm in-side as he felt her gratitude for his
reassurances and companionship. Lean-ing out from Folkvír, he put a hand on her rough cheek and held
it there for a moment. Go on, little one, she murmured. I will see you later.
Eragon hated to leave her in such a state. He reluctantly entered the forest with Orik and the elves,
heading west toward the heart of Du Weldenvarden. After an hour spent pondering Saphira’s plight, he
men-tioned it to Arya.
Faint lines creased Arya’s forehead as she frowned. “It is one of Galba-torix’s greatest crimes. I do not
know if a solution exists, but we can hope. We must hope.”
THE PINEWOOD CITY

Eragon had been in Du Weldenvarden for so long that he had begun to long for clearings, fields, or even
a mountain, instead of the endless tree trunks and meager underbrush. His flights with Saphira provided
no res-pite as they only revealed hills of prickly green that rolled unbroken into the distance like a verdant
sea.
Oftentimes, the branches were so thick overhead, it was impossible to tell from what direction the sun

Page 445

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

rose and set. That, combined with the repetitive scenery, made Eragon hopelessly lost, no matter how
many times Arya or Lifaen troubled to show him the points of the compass. If not for the elves, he knew
that he could wander in Du Weldenvarden for the rest of his life without ever finding his way free.
When it rained, the clouds and the forest canopy plunged them into profound darkness, as if they were
entombed deep underground. The fal-ling water would collect on the black pine needles above, then
trickle through and pour a hundred feet or more down onto their heads, like a thousand little waterfalls.
At such times, Arya would summon a glowing orb of green magic that floated over her right hand and
provided the only light in the cavernous forest. They would stop and huddle underneath a tree until the
storm abated, but even then water cached in the myriad branches would, at the slightest provocation,
shower them with droplets for hours afterward.
As they rode deeper into the heart of Du Weldenvarden, the trees grew thicker and taller, as well as
farther apart to accommodate the in-creased span of their branches. The trunks—bare brown shafts that
tow-ered up into the overarching ribbed ceiling, which was smudged and ob-scured by shadow—were
over two hundred feet tall, higher than any tree in the Spine or the Beors. Eragon paced out the girth of
one tree and measured it at seventy feet.
He mentioned this to Arya, and she nodded, saying, “It means that we are near Ellesméra.” She reached
out and rested her hand lightly on the gnarled root beside her, as if touching, with consummate delicacy,
the shoulder of a friend or lover. “These trees are among the oldest living creatures in Alagaësia. Elves
have loved them since first we saw Du Wel-denvarden, and we have done everything within our power
to help them flourish.” A faint blade of light pierced the dusty emerald branches over-head and limned her
arm and face with liquid gold, dazzlingly bright against the murky background. “We have traveled far
together, Eragon, but now you are about to enter my world. Tread softly, for the earth and air are heavy
with memories and naught is as it seems.... Do not fly with Saphira today, as we have already triggered
certain wards that protect Ellesméra. It would be unwise to stray from the path.”
Eragon bowed his head and retreated to Saphira, who lay curled on a bed of moss, amusing herself by
releasing plumes of smoke from her nos-trils and watching them roil out of sight. Without preamble, she
said, There is plenty of room for me on the ground now. I will have no difficulty.
Good.He mounted Folkvír and followed Orik and the elves farther into the empty, silent forest. Saphira
crawled beside him. She and the white horses gleamed in the somber half light.
Eragon paused, overcome by the solemn beauty of his surroundings. Everything had a feeling of wintry
age, as if nothing had changed under the thatched needles for a thousand years and nothing ever would;
time itself seemed to have fallen into a slumber from which it would never wake.
In late afternoon, the gloom lifted to reveal an elf standing before them, sheathed in a brilliant ray of light
that slanted down from the ceiling. He was garbed in flowing robes, with a circlet of silver upon his brow.
His face was old, noble, and serene.
“Eragon,” murmured Arya. “Show him your palm and your ring.”
Baring his right hand, Eragon raised it so that first Brom’s ring and then the gedwëy ignasia was visible.
The elf smiled, closed his eyes, and spread his arms in a gesture of welcome. He held the posture.
“The way is clear,” said Arya. At a soft command, her steed moved forward. They rode around the
elf—like water parting at the base of a weathered boulder—and when they had all passed, he
straightened, clasped his hands, and vanished as the light that illuminated him ceased to exist.

Page 446

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Who is he?asked Saphira.
Arya said, “He is Gilderien the Wise, Prince of House Miolandra, wielder of the White Flame of Vándil,
and guardian of Ellesméra since the days of Du Fyrn Skulblaka, our war with the dragons. None may
en-ter the city unless he permits it.”
A quarter of a mile beyond, the forest thinned and breaks appeared within the canopy, allowing planks
of mottled sunlight to bar the way. Then they passed underneath two burled trees that leaned against each
other and stopped at the edge of an empty glade.
The ground was strewn with dense patches of flowers. From pink roses to bluebells and lilies, spring’s
fleeting treasure was heaped about like piles of rubies, sapphires, and opals. Their intoxicating aromas
attracted hordes of bumblebees. To the right, a stream chuckled behind a row of bushes, while a pair of
squirrels chased each other around a rock.
At first it looked to Eragon like a place where deer might bed for the night. But as he continued to stare,
he began to pick out paths hidden among the brush and trees; soft warm light where normally there
would be auburn shadows; an odd pattern in the shapes of the twigs and branches and flowers, so subtle
that it nearly escaped detection—clues that what he saw was not entirely natural. He blinked, and his
vision suddenly shifted as if a lens had been placed over his eyes, resolving eve-rything into recognizable
shapes. Those were paths, aye. And those were flowers, aye. But what he had taken to be clusters of
lumpy, twisted trees were in fact graceful buildings that grew directly out of the pines.
One tree bulged at the base to form a two-story house before sinking its roots into the loam. Both
stories were hexagonal, although the upper level was half as small as the first, which gave the house a
tiered appear-ance. The roofs and walls were made of webbed sheets of wood draped over six thick
ridges. Moss and yellow lichen bearded the eaves and hung over jeweled windows set into each side.
The front door was a mysteri-ous black silhouette recessed under an archway wrought with symbols.
Another house was nestled between three pines, which were joined to it through a series of curved
branches. Reinforced by those flying but-tresses, the house rose five levels, light and airy. Beside it sat a
bower woven out of willow and dogwood and hung with flameless lanterns dis-guised as galls.
Each unique building enhanced and complemented its surroundings, blending seamlessly with the rest of
the forest until it was impossible to tell where artifice ended and nature resumed. The two were in perfect
balance. Instead of mastering their environment, the elves had chosen to accept the world as it was and
adapt themselves to it.
The inhabitants of Ellesméra eventually revealed themselves as a flicker of movement at the fringe of
Eragon’s sight, no more than needles stirring in the breeze. Then he caught glimpses of hands, a pale face,
a sandaled foot, an upraised arm. One by one, the wary elves stepped into view, their almond eyes fixed
upon Saphira, Arya, and Eragon.
The women wore their hair unbound. It rippled down their backs in waves of silver and sable braided
with fresh blossoms, like a garden wa-terfall. They all possessed a delicate, ethereal beauty that belied
their un-breakable strength; to Eragon, they seemed flawless. The men were just as striking, with high
cheekbones, finely sculpted noses, and heavy eye-lids. Both sexes were garbed in rustic tunics of green
and brown, fringed with dusky colors of orange, russet, and gold.
The Fair Folk indeed,thought Eragon. He touched his lips in greeting.

Page 447

As one, the elves bowed from the waist. Then they smiled and laughed with unrestrained happiness.
From within their midst, a woman sang:
Gala O Wyrda brunhvitr,
Abr Berundal vandr-fódhr,
Burthro laufsblädar ekar undir,
Eom kona dauthleikr...
Eragon clapped his hands over his ears, fearing that the melody was a spell like the one he had heard at
Sílthrim, but Arya shook her head and lifted his hands. “It is not magic.” Then she spoke to her horse,
saying, “Gánga.” The stallion nickered and trotted away. “Release your steeds as well. We have no
further need of them and they deserve to rest in our stables.”
The song waxed stronger as Arya proceeded along a cobblestone path set with bits of green tourmaline,
which looped among the hollyhocks and the houses and the trees before finally crossing a stream. The
elves danced around their party as they walked, flitting here and there as the fancy struck them, laughing,
and occasionally leaping up onto a branch to run over their heads. They praised Saphira with names like
“Longclaws” and “Daughter of Air and Fire” and “Strong One.”
Eragon smiled, delighted and enchanted. I could live here, he thought with a sense of peace. Tucked
away in Du Weldenvarden, as much out-doors as in, safe from the rest of the world... Yes, he liked
Ellesméra very much indeed, more than any of the dwarf cities. He pointed to a dwelling situated within a
pine tree and asked Arya, “How is that done?
“We sing to the forest in the old tongue and give it our strength to grow in the shape that we desire. All
our buildings and tools are made in that manner.”
The path ended at a net of roots that formed steps, like bare pools of earth. They climbed to a door
embedded within a wall of saplings. Er-agon’s heart quickened as the door swung open, seemingly of its
own ac-cord, and revealed a hall of trees. Hundreds of branches melded together to form the
honeycombed ceiling. Below, twelve chairs were arrayed along each wall.
In them reposed four-and-twenty elf lords and ladies.
Wise and handsome were they, with smooth faces unmarked by age and keen eyes that gleamed with
excitement. They leaned forward, grip-ping the arms of their chairs, and stared at Eragon’s group with
open wonder and hope. Unlike the other elves, they had swords belted at their waists—hilts studded
with beryls and garnets—and circlets that adorned their brows.
And at the head of the assembly stood a white pavilion that sheltered a throne of knotted roots. Queen
Islanzadí sat upon it. She was as beautiful as an autumn sunset, proud and imperious, with two dark
eyebrows slanted like upraised wings, lips as bright and red as holly berries, and midnight hair bound
under a diamond diadem. Her tunic was crimson. Round her hips hung a girdle of braided gold. And
clasped at the hollow of her neck was a velvet cloak that fell to the ground in languid folds. De-spite her
imposing countenance, the queen seemed fragile, as if she con-cealed a great pain.
By her left hand was a curved rod with a chased crosspiece. A brilliant-white raven perched on it,

shuffling impatiently from foot to foot. He cocked his head and surveyed Eragon with uncanny
intelligence, then gave a long, low croak and shrieked, “Wyrda!” Eragon shivered from the force of that
single cracked word.
The door closed behind the six of them as they entered the hall and approached the queen. Arya knelt
on the moss-covered ground and bowed first, then Eragon, Orik, Lifaen, and Narí. Even Saphira, who
had never bowed to anyone, not even Ajihad or Hrothgar, lowered her head.
Islanzadí stood and descended from the throne, her cloak trailing be-hind her. She stopped before Arya,
placed trembling hands on her shoul-ders, and said in a rich vibrato, “Rise.” Arya did, and the queen
scrutinized her face with increasing intensity, until it seemed as if she were trying to decipher an obscure
text.
At last Islanzadí cried out and embraced Arya, saying, “O my daughter, I have wronged you!”
QUEEN ISLANZADÍ

Eragon knelt before the queen of the elves and her councilors in a fan-tastic room made from the boles
of living trees in a near-mythic land, and the only thing that filled his mind was shock. Arya is a princess!
It was fitting in a way—she had always possessed an air of command—but he bitterly regretted the fact,
for it placed another barrier between them when he would have torn them all away. The knowledge filled
his mouth with the taste of ashes. He remembered Angela’s prophecy that he would love one of noble
birth... and her warning that she could not see if it would end for good or for ill.
He could feel Saphira’s own surprise, then her amusement. She said, It appears that we have been
traveling in the presence of royalty without know-ing it.
Why didn’t she tell us?
Perhaps it would have placed her in greater danger.
“Islanzadí Dröttning,” said Arya formally.
The queen withdrew as if she had been stung and then repeated in the ancient language, “O my daughter,
I have wronged you.” She covered her face. “Ever since you disappeared, I’ve barely slept or eaten. I
was haunted by your fate, and feared that I would never see you again. Banning you from my presence
was the greatest mistake I have ever made.... Can you forgive me?”
The gathered elves stirred with amazement.
Arya’s response was long in coming, but at last she said, “For seventy years, I have lived and loved,
fought and killed without ever speaking to you, my mother. Our lives are long, but even so, that is no
small span.”
Islanzadí drew herself upright, lifting her chin. A tremor ran her length. “I cannot undo the past, Arya, no
matter how much I might desire to.”
“And I cannot forget what I endured.”

Page 449

“Nor should you.” Islanzadí clasped her daughter’s hands. “Arya, I love you. You are my only family.
Go if you must, but unless you wish to re-nounce me, I would be reconciled with you.”
For a terrible moment, it seemed as if Arya would not answer, or worse, would reject the offer. Eragon
saw her hesitate and quickly look at her audience. Then she lowered her eyes and said, “No, Mother. I
could not leave.” Islanzadí smiled uncertainly and embraced her daughter again. This time Arya returned
the gesture, and smiles broke out among the as-sembled elves.
The white raven hopped on his stand, cackling, “And on the door was graven evermore, what now
became the family lore, Let us never do but to adore! ”
“Hush, Blagden,” said Islanzadí to the raven. “Keep your doggerel to yourself.” Breaking free, the queen
turned to Eragon and Saphira. “You must excuse me for being discourteous and ignoring you, our most
im-portant guests.”
Eragon touched his lips and then twisted his right hand over his ster-num, as Arya had taught him.
“Islanzadí Dröttning. Atra esterní ono thelduin.” He had no doubt that he was supposed to speak first.
Islanzadí’s dark eyes widened. “Atra du evarínya ono varda.”
“Un atra mor’ranr lífa unin hjarta onr,” replied Eragon, completing the ritual. He could tell that the elves
were caught off guard by his knowl-edge of their customs. In his mind, he listened as Saphira repeated
his greeting to the queen.
When she finished, Islanzadí asked, “Dragon, what is your name?”
Saphira.
A flash of recognition appeared in the queen’s expression, but she made no comment on it. “Welcome
to Ellesméra, Saphira. And yours, Rider?”
“Eragon Shadeslayer, Your Majesty.” This time an audible stir rippled among the elves seated behind
them; even Islanzadí appeared startled.
“You carry a powerful name,” she said softly, “one that we rarely be-stow upon our children....
Welcome to Ellesméra, Eragon Shadeslayer. We have waited long for you.” She moved on to Orik,
greeted him, then returned to her throne and draped her velvet cloak over her arm. “I as-sume by your
presence here, Eragon, so soon after Saphira’s egg was cap-tured, and by the ring on your hand and the
sword on your hip, that Brom is dead and that your training with him was incomplete. I wish to hear your
full story, including how Brom fell and how you came to meet my daughter, or how she met you, as it
may be. Then I will hear of your mission here, dwarf, and of your adventures, Arya, since your ambush in
Du Weldenvarden.”
Eragon had narrated his experiences before, so he had no trouble reiter-ating them now for the queen.
The few occasions where his memory fal-tered, Saphira was able to provide an accurate description of
events. In several places, he simply left the telling to her. When they finished, Er-agon retrieved
Nasuada’s scroll from his pack and presented it to Islan-zadí.
She took the roll of parchment, broke the red wax seal, and, upon completing the missive, sighed and
briefly closed her eyes. “I see now the true depth of my folly. My grief would have ended so much
sooner if I had not withdrawn our warriors and ignored Ajihad’s messengers after learning that Arya had

Page 450

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

been ambushed. I should have never blamed the Varden for her death. For one so old, I am still far too
foolish....”
A long silence followed, as no one dared to agree or disagree. Summon-ing his courage, Eragon said,
“Since Arya has returned alive, will you agree to help the Varden, like before? Nasuada cannot succeed
otherwise, and I am pledged to her cause.”
“My quarrel with the Varden is as dust in the wind,” said Islanzadí. “Fear not; we will assist them as we
once did, and more, because of you and their victory over the Urgals.” She leaned forward on one arm.
“Will you give me Brom’s ring, Eragon?” Without hesitation, he pulled it off his finger and offered it to the
queen, who plucked it from his palm with her slim fingers. “You should not have worn this, Eragon, as it
was not meant for you. However, because of the aid you have rendered the Varden and my family, I
now name you Elf Friend and bestow this ring, Aren, upon you, so that all elves, wherever you go, will
know that you are to be trusted and helped.”
Eragon thanked her and returned the ring to his finger, acutely aware of the queen’s gaze, which
remained upon him with disturbing perception, studying and analyzing. He felt as if she knew everything
that he might say or do. She said, “Such tidings as yours, we have not heard the like of in Du
Weldenvarden for many a year. We are accustomed to a slower way of life here than the rest of
Alagaësia, and it troubles me that so much could occur so swiftly without word of it reaching my ear.”
“And what of my training?” Eragon snatched a furtive glance at the seated elves, wondering if any of
them could be Togira Ikonoka, the be-ing who had reached into his mind and freed him of Durza’s foul
influ-ence after the battle in Farthen Dûr—and who had also encouraged Er-agon to travel to Ellesméra.
“It will begin in the fullness of time. Yet I fear that instructing you is futile so long as your infirmity
persists. Unless you can overcome the Shade’s magic, you will be reduced to no more than a figurehead.
You may still be useful, but only as a shadow of the hope that we have nur-tured for over a century.”
Islanzadí spoke without reproach, yet her words struck Eragon like hammer blows. He knew that she
was right. “Your situation is not your fault, and it pains me to voice such things, but you must understand
the gravity of your disability.... I am sorry.”
Then Islanzadí addressed Orik: “It has been long since one of your race entered our halls, dwarf.
Eragon-finiarel has explained your presence, but do you have aught to add?”
“Only royal greetings from my king, Hrothgar, and a plea, now un-needed, for you to resume contact
with the Varden. Beyond that, I am here to see that the pact that Brom forged between you and the
humans is honored.”
“We keep our promises whether we utter them in this language or in the ancient language. I accept
Hrothgar’s greetings and return them in kind.” Finally, as Eragon was sure she had longed to do since
they first ar-rived, Islanzadí looked at Arya and asked, “Now, daughter, what befell you?”
Arya began to speak in a slow monotone, first of her capture and then of her long imprisonment and
torture in Gil’ead. Saphira and Eragon had deliberately avoided the details of her abuse, but Arya herself
seemed to have no difficulty recounting what she had been subjected to. Her emo-tionless descriptions
roused the same rage within Eragon as when he first saw her wounds. The elves remained completely
silent throughout Arya’s tale, although they gripped their swords and their faces hardened into ra-zor lines
of cold anger. A single tear rolled down Islanzadí’s cheek.
Afterward, a lithe elf lord paced along the mossy sward between the chairs. “I know that I speak for us

Page 451

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

all, Arya Dröttningu, when I say that my heart burns with sorrow for your ordeal. It is a crime beyond
apology, mitigation, or reparation, and Galbatorix must be punished for it. Also, we are in your debt for
keeping the locations of our cities hidden from the Shade. Few of us could have withstood him for so
long.”
“Thank you, Däthedr-vor.”
Now Islanzadí spoke, and her voice rang like a bell among the trees. “Enough. Our guests wait tired on
their feet, and we have spoken of evil things for far too long. I will not have this occasion marred by
lingering on past injuries.” A glorious smile brightened her expression. “My daugh-ter has returned, a
dragon and her Rider have appeared, and I will see us celebrate in the proper fashion!” She stood, tall
and magnificent in her crimson tunic, and clapped her hands. At the sound, the chairs and pavil-ion were
showered with hundreds of lilies and roses that appeared twenty feet above their heads and drifted down
like colorful snowflakes, suffusing the air with their heady fragrance.
She didn’t use the ancient language,observed Eragon.
He noticed that, while everyone was occupied by the flowers, Islanzadí touched Arya gently on the
shoulder and murmured, almost too softly to hear, “You never would have suffered so if you had taken
my counsel. I was right to oppose your decision to accept the yawë.”
“It was my decision to make.”
The queen paused, then nodded and extended her arm. “Blagden.” With a flutter of wings, the raven
flew from his perch and landed on her left shoulder. The entire assembly bowed as Islanzadí proceeded
to the end of the hall and threw open the door to the hundreds of elves outside, whereupon she made a
brief declaration in the ancient language that Er-agon did not understand. The elves burst into cheers and
began to rush about.
“What did she say?” whispered Eragon to Narí.
Narí smiled. “To break open our finest casks and light the cook-fires, for tonight shall be a night of feast
and song. Come!” He grabbed Eragon’s hand and pulled him after the queen as she threaded her way
between the shaggy pines and through banks of cool ferns. During their time in-doors, the sun had
dropped low in the sky, drenching the forest with an amber light that clung to the trees and plants like a
layer of glistering oil.
You do realize, don’t you,said Saphira, that the king Lifaen mentioned, Evandar, must be Arya’s
father?
Eragon almost stumbled. You’re right.... And that means he was killed by either Galbatorix or the
Forsworn.
Circles within circles.
They stopped on the crest of a small hill, where a team of elves had set out a long trestle table and
chairs. All around them, the forest hummed with activity. As evening approached, the cheery glow of fires
appeared scattered throughout Ellesméra, including a bonfire near the table.
Someone handed Eragon a goblet made of the same odd wood that he had noticed in Ceris. He drank
the cup’s clear liqueur and gasped as it blazed down his throat. It tasted like mulled cider mixed with

Page 452

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

mead. The potion made the tips of his fingers and ears tingle and gave him a marvel-ous sense of clarity.
“What is this?” he asked Narí.
Narí laughed. “Faelnirv? We distill it from crushed elderberries and spun moonbeams. If he needs must,
a strong man can travel for three days on naught else.”
Saphira, you have to taste this.She sniffed the goblet, then opened her mouth and allowed him to pour
the rest of the faelnirv down her throat. Her eyes widened and her tail twitched.
Now that’s a treat! Is there more?
Before Eragon could reply, Orik stomped over to them. “Daughter to the queen,” he grumbled, shaking
his head. “I wish that I could tell Hrothgar and Nasuada. They’d want to know.”
Islanzadí seated herself in a high-backed chair and clapped her hands once again. From within the city
came a quartet of elves bearing musical instruments. Two had harps of cherrywood, the third a set of
reed pipes, and the fourth nothing but her voice, which she immediately put to use with a playful song that
danced about their ears.
Eragon caught only every third word or so, but what he did understand made him grin. It was the story
of a stag who could not drink at a pond because a magpie kept harassing him.
As Eragon listened, his gaze wandered and alighted upon a small girl prowling behind the queen. When
he looked again, he saw that her shaggy hair was not silver, like many of the elves, but bleached white
with age, and that her face was creased and lined like a dry, withered apple. She was no elf, nor dwarf,
nor—Eragon felt—even human. She smiled at him, and he glimpsed rows of sharp teeth.
When the singer finished, and the pipes and lutes filled the silence, Er-agon found himself approached by
scores of elves who wished to meet him and—more importantly, he sensed—Saphira.
The elves presented themselves by bowing softly and touching their lips with their first and middle
fingers, to which Eragon responded in kind, along with endless repetitions of their greeting in the ancient
lan-guage. They plied Eragon with polite questions about his exploits, but they reserved the bulk of their
conversation for Saphira.
At first Eragon was content to let Saphira talk, since this was the first place where anyone was interested
in having a discussion just with her. But he soon grew annoyed at being ignored; he had become used to
hav-ing people listen when he spoke. He grinned ruefully, dismayed that he had come to rely on people’s
attention so much since he had joined the Varden, and forced himself to relax and enjoy the celebration.
Before long the scent of food permeated the glade and elves appeared carrying platters piled with
delicacies. Aside from loaves of warm bread and stacks of small, round honeycakes, the dishes were
made entirely of fruit, vegetables, and berries. The berries predominated; they were in everything from
blueberry soup to raspberry sauce to thimbleberry jelly. A bowl of sliced apples dripped with syrup and
sprinkled with wild strawberries sat beside a mushroom pie stuffed with spinach, thyme, and currants.
No meat was to be found, not even fish or fowl, which still puzzled Er-agon. In Carvahall and elsewhere
in the Empire, meat was a symbol of status and luxury. The more gold you had, the more often you could
af-ford steak and veal. Even the minor nobility ate meat with every meal. To do otherwise would indicate
a deficit in their coffers. And yet the elves did not subscribe to this philosophy, despite their obvious
wealth and the ease with which they could hunt with magic.

Page 453

The elves rushed to the table with an enthusiasm that surprised Eragon. Soon all were seated: Islanzadí
at the head of the table with Blagden, the raven; Däthedr to her left; Arya and Eragon by her right hand;
Orik across from them; and then all the rest of the elves, including Narí and Lifaen. No chair was at the
far end of the table, only a huge carved plate for Saphira.
As the meal progressed, everything dissolved around Eragon into a blur of talk and mirth. He was so
caught up in the festivities, he lost track of time, aware of only the laughter and the foreign words swirling
over his head and the warm glow left in his stomach by the faelnirv. The elusive harp music sighed and
whispered at the edges of his hearing and sent shivers of excitement down his side. Occasionally, he
found himself dis-tracted by the lazy slit-eyed stare of the woman-child, which she kept focused on him
with single-minded intensity, even when eating.
During a lull in the conversation, Eragon turned toward Arya, who had uttered no more than a dozen
words. He said nothing, only looked and wondered who she really was.
Arya stirred. “Not even Ajihad knew.”
“What?”
“Outside of Du Weldenvarden, I told no one of my identity. Brom was aware of it—he first met me
here—but he kept it a secret at my request.”
Eragon wondered if she was explaining to him out of a sense of duty or because she felt guilty for
deceiving him and Saphira. “Brom once said that what elves didn’t say was often more important that
what they did.”
“He understood us well.”
“Why, though? Did it matter if anyone knew?”
This time Arya hesitated. “When I left Ellesméra, I had no desire to be reminded of my position. Nor did
it seem relevant to my task with the Varden and dwarves. It had nothing to do with who I became... with
who I am.” She glanced at the queen.
“You could have told Saphira and me.”
Arya seemed to bridle at the reproach in his voice. “I had no reason to suspect that my standing with
Islanzadí had improved, and telling you that would have changed nothing. My thoughts are my own,
Eragon.” He flushed at her implied meaning: Why should she— who was a diplomat, a princess, an elf,
and older than both his father and grandfather, whoever they were—confide in him, a sixteen-year-old
human?
“At least,” he muttered, “you made up with your mother.”
She smiled oddly. “Did I have a choice?”
At that moment, Blagden jumped from Islanzadí’s shoulder and strut-ted down the middle of the table,
bobbing his head left and right in a mocking bow. He stopped before Saphira, uttered a hoarse cough,
and then croaked:

Page 454

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Dragons, like wagons,
Have tongues.
Dragons, like flagons,
Have necks.
But while two hold beer,
The other eats deer!
The elves froze with mortified expressions while they waited for Saphira’s reaction. After a long silence,
Saphira looked up from her quince pie and released a puff of smoke that enveloped Blagden. And lit-tle
birds too, she said, projecting her thoughts so that everyone could hear. The elves finally laughed as
Blagden staggered back, cawing indignantly and flapping his wings to clear the air.
“I must apologize for Blagden’s wretched verses,” said Islanzadí. “He has ever had a saucy tongue,
despite our attempts to tame it.”
Apology accepted,said Saphira calmly, and returned to her pie.
“Where does he come from?” Eragon asked, eager to return to more cordial footing with Arya but also
genuinely curious.
“Blagden,” said Arya, “once saved my father’s life. Evandar was fighting an Urgal when he stumbled and
lost his sword. Before the Urgal could strike, a raven flew at him and pecked out his eyes. No one
knows why the bird did it, but the distraction allowed Evandar to regain his balance and so win the battle.
My father was always generous, so he thanked the raven by blessing him with spells for intelligence and
long life. However, the magic had two effects that he did not foresee: Blagden lost all color in his feathers
and he gained the ability to predict certain events.”
“He can see into the future?” asked Eragon, startled.
“See? No. But perhaps he can sense what is to come. In any case, he al-ways speaks in riddles, most of
which are a fair bit of nonsense. Just re-member that if Blagden ever comes to you and tells you
something that is not a joke or a pun, you would do well to heed his words.”
Once the meal had concluded, Islanzadí stood—causing a flurry of ac-tivity as everyone hastened to do
likewise—and said, “It is late, I am tired, and I would return to my bower. Accompany me, Saphira and
Eragon, and I will show you where you may sleep tonight.” The queen motioned with one hand to Arya,
then left the table. Arya followed.
As Eragon stepped around the table with Saphira, he paused by the woman-child, caught by her feral
eyes. All the elements of her appear-ance, from her eyes to her shaggy hair to her white fangs, triggered
Er-agon’s memory. “You’re a werecat, aren’t you?” She blinked once and then bared her teeth in a
dangerous smile. “I met one of your kin, Solem-bum, in Teirm and in Farthen Dûr.”
Her grin widened. “Aye. A good one he is. Humans bore me, but he finds it amusing to travel with the
witch Angela.” Then her gaze switched to Saphira and she uttered a throaty half-growl, half-purr of
appreciation.

Page 455

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

What is your name?asked Saphira.
“Names be powerful things in the heart of Du Weldenvarden, dragon, yes they are. However... among
the elves, I am known as The Watcher and as Quickpaw and as The Dream Dancer, but you may know
me as Maud.” She tossed her mane of stiff white bangs. “You’d better catch up with the queen,
younglings; she does not take lightly to fools or laggards.”
“It was a pleasure meeting you, Maud,” said Eragon. He bowed, and Saphira inclined her head. Eragon
glanced at Orik, wondering where the dwarf would be taken, and then pursued Islanzadí.
They overtook the queen just as she reached the base of a tree. The trunk was ridged by a delicate
staircase that spiraled up to a series of globular rooms cupped and suspended in the tree’s crown by a
spray of branches.
Islanzadí lifted an elegant hand and pointed at the eyrie. “You needs must fly there, Saphira. Our stairs
were not grown with dragons in mind.”
Then she spoke to Eragon: “This is where the leader of the Dragon Riders would dwell while in
Ellesméra. I give it to you now, for you are the rightful heir to that title.... It is your inheritance.” Before
Eragon could thank her, the queen swept past and departed with Arya, who held his gaze for a long
moment before vanishing deeper into the city.
Shall we see what accommodations they’ve provided us with?asked Saphira. She jumped into the air
and sailed around the tree in a tight cir-cle, balancing on one wing tip, perpendicular to the ground.
As Eragon took the first step, he saw that Islanzadí had spoken true; the stairs were one with the tree.
The bark beneath his feet was smooth and flat from the many elves who had traversed it, but it was still
part of the trunk, as were the twisting cobweb banisters by his side and the curved railing that slid under
his right hand.
Because the stairs had been designed with the elves’ strength in mind, they were steeper than Eragon
was used to, and his calves and thighs soon began to burn. He was breathing so hard when he reached
the top—after climbing through a trapdoor in the floor of one of the rooms—he had to put his hands on
his knees and bend over to pant. Once recovered, he straightened and examined his surroundings.
He stood in a circular vestibule with a pedestal in the center, out of which spiraled a sculpture of two
pale hands and forearms that twined around each other without touching. Three screen doors led from
the vestibule—one to an austere dining room that might hold ten people at the most, one to a closet with
an empty hollow in the floor that Eragon could think of no discernible use for, and the last to a bedroom
overlook-ing, and open to, the wide expanse of Du Weldenvarden.
Taking a lantern from its hook in the ceiling, Eragon entered the bed-room, creating a host of shadows
that jumped and swirled like madcap dancers. A teardrop gap large enough for a dragon pierced the
outer wall. Inside the room was a bed, situated so that he could watch the sky and the moon while lying
on his back; a fireplace made of gray wood that felt as hard and cold as steel when he touched it, as if
the timber had been compressed to unsurpassed density; and a huge low-rimmed bowl set in the floor
and lined with soft blankets where Saphira could sleep.
Even as he watched, she swooped down and landed on the edge of the opening, her scales twinkling
like a constellation of blue stars. Behind her, the last rays of the sun streaked across the forest, painting

the various ridges and hills with a hazy amber that made the needles glow like hot iron and chased the
shadows back toward the violet horizon. From their height, the city appeared as a series of gaps in the
voluminous canopy, is-lands of calm in a restless ocean. Ellesméra’s true scope was now revealed; it
extended for several miles to the west and to the north.
I respect the Riders even more if this is how Vrael normally lived,said Er-agon. It’s much simpler than
I expected. The entire structure rocked slightly in response to a breath of wind.
Saphira sniffed her blankets. We have yet to see Vroengard, she cau-tioned, although he sensed that
she agreed with him.
As Eragon closed the screen to the bedroom, he saw something in the corner that he had missed during
his first inspection: a spiral staircase that wound up a dark wood chimney. Thrusting the lantern before
him, he cautiously ascended, one step at a time. After about twenty feet, he emerged in a study furnished
with a writing desk—stocked with quills, ink, and paper, but no parchment—and another padded roost
for a dragon to curl up on. The far wall also had an opening to fly through.
Saphira, come see this.
How?she asked.
Through the outside.Eragon winced as layers of bark splintered and cracked under Saphira’s claws
while she crawled out of the bedroom and up the side of the compound to the study. Satisfied? he asked
when she arrived. Saphira raked him with her sapphire eyes, then proceeded to scrutinize the walls and
furniture.
I wonder,she said, how you are supposed to stay warm when the rooms are open to the elements?
I don’t know.Eragon examined the walls on either side of the breach, running his hands over abstract
patterns that had been coaxed from the tree by the elves’ songs. He stopped when he felt a vertical ridge
embed-ded in the bark. He tugged on it, and a diaphanous membrane unspooled from within the wall.
Pulling it across the portal, he found a second groove to hold the hem of the cloth. As soon as it was
fastened, the air thickened and became noticeably hotter. There’s your answer, he said. He released the
cloth and it lashed back and forth as it rewound itself.
When they returned to the bedroom, Eragon unpacked while Saphira coiled upon her dais. He carefully
arranged his shield, bracers, greaves, coif, and helm, then stripped off his tunic and removed his shirt of
leather-backed mail. He sat bare-chested on the bed and studied the oiled links, struck by their similarity
to Saphira’s scales.
We made it,he said, bemused.
A long journey... but yes, we made it. We’re lucky that misfortune did not strike upon the road.
He nodded. Now we’ll find out if it was worth it. Sometimes I wonder if our time would have been
better spent helping the Varden.
Eragon! You know that we need further instruction. Brom would have wanted it. Besides, Ellesméra and
Islanzadí were certainly worth coming all this way to see.
Maybe.Finally, he asked, What do you make of all this?

Page 457

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Saphira parted her jaws slightly to show her teeth. I don’t know. The elves keep more secrets than
even Brom, and they can do things with magic that I never thought possible. I have no idea what
methods they use to grow their trees into such shapes, nor how Islanzadí summoned those flowers.
It is beyond my ken.
Eragon was relieved that he was not the only one who felt over-whelmed. And Arya?
What about her?
You know, who she really is.
She hasn’t changed, only your perception of her.Saphira chuckled deep in her throat, where it sounded
like stones grinding against each other, and rested her head on her two front feet.
The stars were bright in the sky now, and the soft hoots of owls drifted through Ellesméra. All the world
was calm and silent as it slumbered away the liquid night.
Eragon clambered underneath his downy sheets and reached to shutter the lantern, then stopped, his
hand an inch from the latch. Here he was in the elves’ capital, over a hundred feet in the air, lying in what
used to be Vrael’s bed.
The thought was too much for him.
Rolling upright, he grabbed the lantern with one hand, Zar’roc with the other, and surprised Saphira by
crawling onto her dais and snuggling against her warm side. She hummed and dropped a velvet wing over
him as he extinguished the light and closed his eyes.
Together they slept long and deep in Ellesméra.
OUT OF THE PAST

Eragon woke at dawn well rested. He tapped Saphira’s ribs, and she lifted her wing. Running his hands
through his hair, he walked to the room’s precipice and leaned against one side, bark rough against his
shoulder. Below, the forest sparkled like a field of diamonds as each tree reflected the morning light with
a thousand thousand drops of dew.
He jumped with surprise as Saphira dove past him, twisting like an au-ger toward the canopy before she
pulled up and circled through the sky, roaring with joy. Morning, little one. He smiled, happy that she
was happy.
He opened the screen to their bedroom, where he found two trays of food—mostly fruit—that had been
placed by the lintel during the night. By the trays was a bundle of clothes with a paper note pinned to it.
Er-agon had difficulty deciphering the flowing script, since he had not read for over a month and had
forgotten some of the letters, but at last he un-derstood that it said:
Greetings, Saphira Bjartskular and Eragon Shadeslayer.
I, Bellaen of House Miolandra, do humble myself and apologize to you, Saphira, for this unsatisfactory

meal. Elves do not hunt, and no meat is to be had in Ellesméra, nor in any of our cities. If you wish, you
can do as the dragons of old were wont, and catch what you may in Du Welden-varden. We only ask
that you leave your kills in the forest so that our air and water remain untainted by blood.
Eragon, these clothes are for you. They were woven by Niduen of Is-lanzadí’s house and are her gift to
you.
May good fortune rule over you,
Peace live in your heart,
And the stars watch over you.
Bellaen du Hljödhr
When Eragon told Saphira the message, she said, It does not matter; I won’t need to eat for a while
after yesterday’s meal. However, she did snap up a few seed cakes. Just so that I don’t appear rude,
she explained.
After Eragon finished breakfast, he hauled the bundle of clothes onto his bed and carefully unfolded
them, finding two full-length tunics of rus-set trimmed with thimbleberry green, a set of creamy leggings to
wrap his calves in, and three pairs of socks so soft, they felt like liquid when he pulled them through his
hands. The quality of the fabric shamed the weaving of the women of Carvahall as well as the dwarf
clothes he wore now.
Eragon was grateful for the new raiment. His own tunic and breeches were sadly travel-worn from their
weeks exposed to the rain and sun since Farthen Dûr. Stripping, he donned one of the luxurious tunics,
sa-voring its downy texture.
He had just laced on his boots when someone knocked on the screen to the bedroom. “Come in,” he
said, reaching for Zar’roc.
Orik poked his head inside, then cautiously entered, testing the floor with his feet. He eyed the ceiling.
“Give me a cave any day instead of a bird’s nest like this. How fared your night, Eragon? Saphira?”
“Well enough. And yours?” said Eragon.
“I slept like a rock.” The dwarf chuckled at his own jest, then his chin sank into his beard and he
fingered the head of his ax. “I see you’ve eaten, so I’ll ask you to accompany me. Arya, the queen, and a
host of other elves await you at the base of the tree.” He fixed Eragon with a testy gaze. “Something is
going on that they haven’t told us about. I’m not sure what they want from you, but it’s important.
Islanzadí’s as tense as a cor-nered wolf... I thought I’d warn you beforehand.”
Eragon thanked him, then the two of them descended by way of the stairs, while Saphira glided to earth.
They were met on the ground by Is-lanzadí arrayed in a mantle of ruffled swan feathers, which were like
win-ter snow heaped upon a cardinal’s breast. She greeted them and said, “Fol-low me.”
Her wending course took the group to the edge of Ellesméra, where the buildings were few and the
paths were faint from disuse. At the base of a wooded knoll, Islanzadí stopped and said in a terrible
voice, “Before we go any farther, the three of you must swear in the ancient language that you will never
speak to outsiders of what you are about to see, not without permission from me, my daughter, or

whoever may succeed us to the throne.”
“Why should I gag myself?” demanded Orik.
Why indeed ?asked Saphira. Do you not trust us?
“It is not a matter of trust, but of safety. We must protect this knowl-edge at all costs—it’s our greatest
advantage over Galbatorix—and if you are bound by the ancient language, you will never willingly reveal
our se-cret. You came to supervise Eragon’s training, Orik-vodhr. Unless you give me your word, you
may as well return to Farthen Dûr.”
At last Orik said, “I believe that you mean no harm to dwarves or to the Varden, else I would never
agree. And I hold you to the honor of your hall and clan that this isn’t a ploy to deceive us. Tell me what
to say.”
While the queen tutored Orik in the correct pronunciation of the de-sired phrase, Eragon asked
Saphira, Should I do it?
Do we have a choice?Eragon remembered that Arya had asked the same question yesterday, and he
began to have an inkling of what she had meant: the queen left no room to maneuver.
When Orik finished, Islanzadí looked expectantly at Eragon. He hesi-tated, then delivered the oath, as
did Saphira. “Thank you,” said Islanzadí. “Now we may proceed.”
At the top of the knoll, the trees were replaced by a bed of red clover that ran several yards to the edge
of a stone cliff. The cliff extended a league in either direction and dropped a thousand feet to the forest
be-low, which pooled outward until it merged with the sky. It felt as if they stood on the edge of the
world, staring across an endless expanse of for-est.
I know this place,realized Eragon, remembering his vision of Togira Ik-onoka.
Thud.The air shivered from the strength of the concussion. Thud. An-other dull blow made Eragon’s
teeth chatter. Thud. He jammed his fin-gers in his ears, trying to protect them from the painful spikes in
pres-sure. The elves stood motionless. Thud. The clover bent under a sudden gust of wind.
Thud.From below the edge of the cliff rose a huge gold dragon with a Rider on its back.
CONVICTION

Roran glared at Horst.
They were in Baldor’s room. Roran was propped upright in bed, listen-ing as the smith said, “What did
you expect me to do? We couldn’t at-tack once you fainted. Besides, the men were in no state to fight.
Can’t blame them either. I nearly bit off my tongue when I saw those mon-sters.” Horst shook his wild
mane of hair. “We’ve been dragged into one of the old tales, Roran, and I don’t like it one bit.” Roran
retained his stony expression. “Look, you can kill the soldiers if you want, but you have to get your
strength back first. You’ll have plenty of volunteers; people trust you in battle, especially after you
defeated the soldiers here last night.” When Roran remained silent, Horst sighed, patted him on his good
shoulder, and left the room, closing the door behind him.

Roran did not even blink. So far in his life, he had only truly cared about three things: his family, his home
in Palancar Valley, and Katrina. His family had been annihilated last year. His farm had been smashed
and burned, though the land remained, which was all that really mattered.
But now Katrina was gone.
A choked sob escaped past the iron lump in his throat. He was faced with a quandary that tore at his
very essence: the only way to rescue Katrina would be to somehow pursue the Ra’zac and leave
Palancar Val-ley, yet he could not abandon Carvahall to the soldiers. Nor could he for-get Katrina.
My heart or my home,he thought bitterly. They were worthless with-out each other. If he killed the
soldiers it would only prevent the Ra’zac—and perhaps Katrina—from returning. Anyway, the slaughter
would be pointless if reinforcements were nearby, for their arrival would surely signal Carvahall’s demise.
Roran clenched his teeth as a fresh burst of pain emanated from his bound shoulder. He closed his eyes.
I hope Sloan gets eaten like Quimby. No fate could be too terrible for that traitor. Roran cursed him
with the blackest oaths he knew.
Even if I were free to leave Carvahall, how could I find the Ra’zac? Who would know where they live?
Who would dare inform on Galbatorix’s ser-vants?Despair rolled over him as he wrestled with the
problem. He
imagined himself in one of the great cities of the Empire, searching aim-lessly among dirty buildings and
hordes of strangers for a hint, a glimpse, a taste of his love.
It was hopeless.
A river of tears followed as he doubled over, groaning from the strength of his agony and fear. He
rocked back and forth, blind to any-thing but the desolation of the world.
An endless amount of time reduced Roran’s sobs to weak gasps of pro-test. He wiped his eyes and
forced himself to take a long, shuddering breath. He winced. His lungs felt like they were filled with
shards of glass.
I have to think,he told himself.
He leaned against the wall and—through the sheer strength of his will—began to gradually subdue each
of his unruly emotions, wrestling them into submission to the one thing that could save him from insanity:
reason. His neck and shoulders trembled from the violence of his efforts.
Once he regained control, Roran carefully arranged his thoughts, like a master craftsman organizing his
tools into precise rows. There must be a solution hidden amid my knowledge, if only I’m creative
enough.
He could not track the Ra’zac through the air. That much was clear. Someone would have to tell him
where to find them, and of all the peo-ple he could ask, the Varden probably knew the most. However,
they would be just as hard to find as the desecrators, and he could not waste time searching for them.
Although... A small voice in his head reminded him of the rumors he had heard from trappers and
traders that Surda se-cretly supported the Varden.

Page 461

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Surda.The country lay at the bottom of the Empire, or so Roran had been told, as he had never seen a
map of Alagaësia. Under ideal condi-tions, it would take several weeks to reach on horse, longer if he
had to evade soldiers. Of course, the swiftest mode of transportation would be to sail south along the
coast, but that would mean having to travel all the way to the Toark River and then to Teirm to find a
ship. It would take far too long. And he still might be apprehended by soldiers.
“If, could, would, might, ” he muttered, repeatedly clenching his left hand. North of Teirm, the only port
he knew of was Narda, but to reach it, he would have to cross the entire width of the Spine—a feat
unheard of, even for the trappers.
Roran swore quietly. The conjecture was pointless. I should be trying to save Carvahall, not desert
it. The problem was, he had already deter-mined that the village and all who remained in it were
doomed. Tears gathered at the corners of his eyes again. All who remain...
What... what if everyone in Carvahall accompanied me to Narda and then to Surda?He would achieve
both his desires simultaneously.
The audacity of the idea stunned him.
It was heresy, blasphemy, to think that he could convince the farmers to abandon their fields and the
merchants their shops... and yet... and yet what was the alternative but slavery or death? The Varden
were the only group that would harbor fugitives of the Empire, and Roran was sure that the rebels would
be delighted to have a village’s worth of recruits, espe-cially ones who had proved themselves in battle.
Also, by bringing the villagers to them, he would earn the Varden’s confidence, so that they would trust
him with the location of the Ra’zac. Maybe they can explain why Galbatorix is so desperate to
capture me.
If the plan were to succeed, though, it would have to be implemented before the new troops reached
Carvahall, which left only a few days—if that—to arrange the departure of some three hundred people.
The logis-tics were frightening to consider.
Roran knew that mere reason could not persuade anyone to leave; it would require messianic zeal to stir
people’s emotions, to make them feel in the depths of their hearts the need to relinquish the trappings of
their identities and lives. Nor would it be enough to simply instill fear—for he knew that fear often made
those in peril fight harder. Rather, he had to instill a sense of purpose and destiny, to make the villagers
believe, as he did, that joining the Varden and resisting Galbatorix’s tyranny was the noblest action in the
world.
It required passion that could not be intimidated by hardship, deterred by suffering, or quenched by
death.
In his mind, Roran saw Katrina standing before him, pale and ghostly with solemn amber eyes. He
remembered the heat of her skin, the mulled scent of her hair, and what it felt like to be with her under the
cover of darkness. Then in a long line behind her appeared his family, friends, and everyone he had
known in Carvahall, both dead and alive. If not for Eragon... and me... the Ra’zac would have never
come here. I must rescue the village from the Empire as surely as I must rescue Katrina from
those desecrators.
Drawing upon the strength of his vision, Roran rose from bed, causing his maimed shoulder to burn and
sting. He staggered and leaned against a wall. Will I ever regain the use of my right arm ? He waited
for the pain to subside. When it did not, he bared his teeth, shoved himself upright, and marched from the

room.
Elain was folding towels in the hallway. She cried out with amazement. “Roran! What are you—”
“Come,” he growled, lurching past.
With a worried expression, Baldor stepped out of a doorway. “Roran, you shouldn’t be walking around.
You lost too much blood. I’ll help—”
“Come.”
Roran heard them follow as he descended the curved stairs toward the entrance of the house, where
Horst and Albriech stood talking. They looked up with astonishment.
“Come.”
He ignored the babble of questions, opened the front door, and stepped into the evening’s faded light.
Above, an imposing plume of clouds was laced with gold and purple.
Leading the small group, Roran stomped to the edge of Carvahall— repeating his monosyllabic message
whenever he passed a man or woman—pulled a torch mounted on a pole from the grasping mud,
wheeled about, and retraced his path to the center of town. There he stabbed the pole between his feet,
then raised his left arm and roared, “COME!”
The village rang with his voice. He continued the summons as people drifted from the houses and
shadowed alleyways and began to gather around him. Many were curious, others sympathetic, some
awed, and some angry. Again and again, Roran’s chant echoed in the valley. Loring arrived with his sons
in tow. From the opposite direction came Birgit, Delwin, and Fisk with his wife, Isold. Morn and Tara
left the tavern to-gether and joined the crush of spectators.
When most of Carvahall stood before him, Roran fell silent, tightening his left fist until his fingernails cut
into his palm. Katrina. Raising his hand, he opened it and showed everyone the crimson tears that
dripped down his arm. “This,” he said, “is my pain. Look well, for it will be yours unless we defeat the
curse wanton fate has set upon us. Your friends and family will be bound in chains, destined for slavery in
foreign lands, or slain before your eyes, hewn open by soldiers’ merciless blades. Galba-torix will sow
our land with salt so that it lies forever fallow. This I have seen. This I know.” He paced like a caged
wolf, glowering and swinging his head. He had their attention. Now he had to stoke them into a frenzy to
match his own.
“My father was killed by the desecrators. My cousin has fled. My farm was razed. And my bride-to-be
was kidnapped by her own father, who murdered Byrd and betrayed us all! Quimby eaten, the hay barn
burned along with Fisk’s and Delwin’s houses. Parr, Wyglif, Ged, Bardrick, Far-old, Hale, Garner,
Kelby, Melkolf, Albem, and Elmund: all slain. Many of you have been injured, like me, so that you can
no longer support your family. Isn’t it enough that we toil every day of our lives to eke a living from the
earth, subjected to the whims of nature? Isn’t it enough that we are forced to pay Galbatorix’s iron taxes,
without also having to endure these senseless torments?” Roran laughed maniacally, howling at the sky
and hearing the madness in his own voice. No one stirred in the crowd.
“I know now the true nature of the Empire and of Galbatorix; they are evil. Galbatorix is an unnatural
blight on the world. He destroyed the Riders and the greatest peace and prosperity we ever had. His
servants are foul demons birthed in some ancient pit. But is Galbatorix content to grind us beneath his

heel? No! He seeks to poison all of Alagaësia, to suf-focate us with his cloak of misery. Our children and
their descendants shall live in the shadow of his darkness until the end of time, reduced to slaves, worms,
vermin for him to torture at his pleasure. Unless...”
Roran stared into the villagers’ wide eyes, conscious of his control over them. No one had ever dared
say what he was about to. He let his voice rasp low in his throat: “Unless we have the courage to resist
evil.
“We’ve fought the soldiers and the Ra’zac, but it means nothing if we die alone and forgotten—or are
carted away as chattel. We cannot stay here, and I won’t allow Galbatorix to obliterate everything that’s
worth living for. I would rather have my eyes plucked out and my hands chopped off than see him
triumph! I choose to fight! I choose to step from my grave and let my enemies bury themselves in it!
“I choose to leave Carvahall.
“I will cross the Spine and take a ship from Narda down to Surda, where I will join the Varden, who
have struggled for decades to free us of this oppression.” The villagers looked shocked at the idea. “But I
do not wish to go alone. Come with me. Come with me and seize this chance to forge a better life for
yourselves. Throw off the shackles that bind you here.” Roran pointed at his listeners, moving his finger
from one target to the next. “A hundred years from now, what names shall drop from the bards’ lips?
Horst... Birgit... Kiselt... Thane; they will recite our sagas. They will sing “The Epic of Carvahall,” for we
were the only village brave enough to defy the Empire.”
Tears of pride flooded Roran’s eyes. “What could be more noble than cleansing Galbatorix’s stain from
Alagaësia? No more would we live in fear of having our farms destroyed, or being killed and eaten. The
grain we harvest would be ours to keep, save for any extra that we might send as a gift to the rightful
king. The rivers and streams would run thick with gold. We would be safe and happy and fat!
“It is our destiny.”
Roran held his hand before his face and slowly closed his fingers over the bleeding wounds. He stood
hunched over his injured arm—crucified by the scores of gazes—and waited for a response to his
speech. None came. At last he realized that they wanted him to continue; they wanted to hear more
about the cause and the future he had portrayed.
Katrina.
Then as darkness gathered around the radius of his torch, Roran drew himself upright and resumed
speaking. He hid nothing, only labored to make them understand his thoughts and feelings, so they too
could share the sense of purpose that drove him. “Our age is at an end. We must step forward and cast
our lot with the Varden if we and our children are to live free.” He spoke with rage and honeyed tones in
equal amount, but always with a fervid conviction that kept his audience entranced.
When his store of images was exhausted, Roran looked into the faces of his friends and neighbors and
said, “I march in two days. Accompany me if you wish, but I go regardless.” He bowed his head and
stepped out of the light.
Overhead, the waning moon glowed behind a lens of clouds. A slight breeze wafted through Carvahall.
An iron weather vane creaked on a roof as it swung in the direction of the current.
From within the crowd, Birgit picked her way into the light, clutching the folds of her dress to avoid

Page 464

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

tripping. With a subdued expression, she adjusted her shawl. “Today we saw an...” She stopped, shook
her head, and laughed in an embarrassed way. “I find it hard to speak after Roran. I don’t like his plan,
but I believe that it’s necessary, although for a differ-ent reason: I would hunt down the Ra’zac and
avenge my husband’s death. I will go with him. And I will take my children.” She too stepped away from
the torch.
A silent minute passed, then Delwin and his wife, Lenna, advanced with their arms around each other.
Lenna looked at Birgit and said, “I un-derstand your need, Sister. We want our vengeance as well, but
more than that, we want the rest of our children to be safe. For that reason, we too will go.” Several
women whose husbands had been slain came for-ward and agreed with her.
The villagers murmured among themselves, then fell silent and mo-tionless. No one else seemed willing
to address the subject; it was too momentous. Roran understood. He was still trying to digest the
implica-tions himself.
Finally, Horst strode to the torch and stared with a drawn face into the flame. “It’s no good talking any
more.... We need time to think. Every man must decide for himself. Tomorrow... tomorrow will be
another day. Perhaps things will be clearer then.” He shook his head and lifted the torch, then inverted it
and extinguished it against the ground, leaving everyone to find their way home in the moonlight.
Roran joined Albriech and Baldor, who walked behind their parents at a discreet distance, giving them
privacy to talk. Neither of the brothers would look at Roran. Unsettled by their lack of expression, Roran
asked, “Do you think anyone else will go? Was I good enough?”
Albriech emitted a bark of laughter. “Good enough!”
“Roran,” said Baldor in an odd voice, “you could have convinced an Ur-gal to become a farmer
tonight.”
“No!”
“When you finished, I was ready to grab my spear and dash into the Spine after you. I wouldn’t have
been alone either. The question isn’t who will leave, it’s who won’t. What you said... I’ve never heard
anything like it before.”
Roran frowned. His goal had been to persuade people to accept his plan, not to get them to follow him
personally. If that’s what it takes, he thought with a shrug. Still, the prospect had caught him unawares.
At an earlier time, it would have disturbed him, but now he was just thankful for anything that could help
him to rescue Katrina and save the villagers.
Baldor leaned toward his brother. “Father would lose most of his tools.” Albriech nodded solemnly.
Roran knew that smiths made whatever implement was required by the task at hand, and that these
custom tools formed a legacy that was bequeathed from father to son, or from master to journeyman.
One measure of a smith’s wealth and skill was the number of tools he owned. For Horst to surrender his
would be... Would be no harder than what any-one else has to do,thought Roran. He only regretted
that it would entail depriving Albriech and Baldor of their rightful inheritance.
When they reached the house, Roran retreated to Baldor’s room and lay in bed. Through the walls, he
could still hear the faint sound of Horst and Elain talking. He fell asleep imagining similar discussions
taking place throughout Carvahall, deciding his—and their—fate.

REPERCUSSIONS

The morning after his speech, Roran looked out his window and saw twelve men leaving Carvahall,
heading toward Igualda Falls. He yawned and limped downstairs to the kitchen.
Horst sat alone at the table, twisting a mug of ale in his hands. “Morn-ing,” he said.
Roran grunted, tore a heel of bread off the loaf on the counter, then seated himself at the opposite end of
the table. As he ate, he noted Horst’s bloodshot eyes and unkempt beard. Roran guessed that the smith
had been awake the entire night. “Do you know why a group is going up—”
“Have to talk with their families,” said Horst abruptly. “They’ve been running into the Spine since dawn.”
He put the mug down with a crack. “You have no idea what you did, Roran, by asking us to leave. The
whole village is in turmoil. You backed us into a corner with only one way out: your way. Some people
hate you for it. Of course a fair number of them already hated you for bringing this upon us.”
The bread in Roran’s mouth tasted like sawdust as resentment flared inside him. Eragon was the one
who brought back the stone, not me. “And the others?”
Horst sipped his ale and grimaced. “The others adore you. I never thought I would see the day when
Garrow’s son would stir my heart with words, but you did it, boy, you did it.” He swung a gnarled hand
over his head. “All this? I built it for Elain and my sons. It took me seven years to finish! See that beam
over the door right there? I broke three toes getting that into place. And you know what? I’m going to
give it up because of what you said last night.”
Roran remained silent; it was what he wanted. Leaving Carvahall was the right thing to do, and since he
had committed himself to that course, he saw no reason to torment himself with guilt and regret. The
decision is made. I will accept the outcome without complaint, no matter how dire, for this is our
only escape from the Empire.
“But,” said Horst, and leaned forward on one elbow, his black eyes burning beneath his brow, “just you
remember that if reality falls short of the airy dreams you conjured, there’ll be debts to pay. Give people
a hope and then take it away, and they’ll destroy you.”
The prospect was of no concern to Roran. If we make it to Surda, we will be greeted as heroes by
the rebels. If we don’t, our deaths will fulfill all debts. When it was clear that the smith had finished,
Roran asked, “Where is Elain?”
Horst scowled at the change of topic. “Out back.” He stood and straightened his tunic over his heavy
shoulders. “I have to go clear out the smithy and decide what tools I’m going to take. I’ll hide or destroy
the rest. The Empire won’t benefit from my work.”
“I’ll help.” Roran pushed back his chair.
“No,” said Horst roughly. “This is a task I can only do with Albriech and Baldor. That forge has been
my entire life, and theirs.... You wouldn’t be much help with that arm of yours anyway. Stay here. Elain
can use you.”

Page 466

After the smith left, Roran opened the side door and found Elain talk-ing with Gertrude by the large pile
of firewood Horst maintained year-round. The healer went up to Roran and put a hand on his forehead.
“Ah, I was afraid that you might have a fever after yesterday’s excitement. Your family heals at the most
extraordinary rate. I could barely believe my eyes when Eragon started walking about after having his
legs skinned and spending two days in bed.” Roran stiffened at the mention of his cousin, but she did not
seem to notice. “Let’s see how your shoulder is doing, shall we?”
Roran bowed his neck so that Gertrude could reach behind him and untie the knot to the wool sling.
When it was undone, he carefully low-ered his right forearm—which was immobilized in a splint—until
his arm was straight. Gertrude slid her fingers under the poultice packed on his wound and peeled it off.
“Oh my,” she said.
A thick, rancid smell clogged the air. Roran clenched his teeth as his gorge rose, then looked down. The
skin under the poultice had turned white and spongy, like a giant birthmark of maggot flesh. The bite itself
had been stitched up while he was unconscious, so all he saw was a jag-ged pink line caked with blood
on the front of his shoulder. Swelling and inflammation had forced the twisted catgut threads to cut deep
into his flesh, while beads of clear liquid oozed from the wound.
Gertrude clucked her tongue as she inspected him, then refastened the bandages and looked Roran in
the eye. “You’re doing well enough, but the tissue may become diseased. I can’t tell yet. If it does, we’ll
have to cauterize your shoulder.”
Roran nodded. “Will my arm work once it heals?”
“As long as the muscle knits together properly. It also depends on how you want to use it. You—”
“Will I be able to fight?”
“If you want to fight,” said Gertrude slowly, “I suggest that you learn to use your left hand.” She patted
his cheek, then hurried back toward her hut.
My arm.Roran stared at his bound limb as if it no longer belonged to him. Until that moment, he had not
realized how closely his sense of identity was linked to the condition of his body. Injuring his flesh caused
injury to his psyche, as well as the other way around. Roran was proud of his body, and seeing it
mutilated sent a jolt of panic through him, espe-cially since the damage was permanent. Even if he
regained the use of his arm, he would always bear a thick scar as a memento of his injury.
Taking his hand, Elain led Roran back into the house, where she crum-bled mint into a kettle, then set it
on the stove to boil. “You really love her, don’t you?”
“What?” He looked at her, startled.
Elain rested a hand on her belly. “Katrina.” She smiled. “I’m not blind. I know what you’ve done for
her, and I’m proud of you. Not every man would go as far.”
“It won’t matter, if I can’t free her.”
The kettle began to whistle stridently. “You will, I’m sure of it—one way or another.” Elain poured the
tea. “We had better start preparing for the trip. I’m going to sort through the kitchen first. While I do, can
you go upstairs and bring me all the clothes, bedding, and anything else you think might be useful?”

“Where should I put it?” asked Roran.
“The dining room will be fine.”
Since the mountains were too steep—and the forest too dense—for wagons, Roran realized that their
supplies were limited to however much they could carry themselves, as well as what they could pile onto
Horst’s two horses, although one of those had to be left partially unburdened so that Elain could ride
whenever the trail proved too strenuous for her pregnancy.
Compounding the issue was the fact that some families in Carvahall did not have enough steeds for both
provisions and the young, old, and infirm who would be unable to keep pace on foot. Everyone would
have to share resources. The question, though, was with whom? They still did not know who else was
going, besides Birgit and Delwin.
Thus, when Elain finished packing the items she deemed essential— mainly food and shelter—she sent
Roran to find out if anyone needed ex-tra storage space and, if not, if she could borrow some in turn, for
there were plenty of nonessential items she wanted to bring but would other-wise abandon.
Despite the people hurrying through the streets, Carvahall was heavy with a forced stillness, an unnatural
calm that belied the feverish activity hidden within the houses. Almost everyone was silent and walked
with downturned faces, engrossed in their own thoughts.
When Roran arrived at Orval’s house, he had to pound on the knocker for almost a minute before the
farmer answered the door. “Oh, it’s you, Stronghammer.” Orval stepped out on the porch. “Sorry for the
wait, but I was busy. How can I help you?” He tapped a long black pipe against his palm, then began to
roll it nervously between his fingers. Inside the house, Roran heard chairs being shoved across the floor
and pots and pans banging together.
Roran quickly explained Elain’s offer and request. Orval squinted up at the sky. “I reckon I’ve got
enough room for my own stuff. Ask around, an’ if you still need space, I have a pair of oxen that could
hold a bit more.”
“So you are going?”
Orval shifted uncomfortably. “Well, I wouldn’t say that. We’re just... getting ready in case of another
attack.”
“Ah.” Puzzled, Roran trudged on to Kiselt’s house. He soon discovered that no one was willing to
reveal whether they had decided to leave— even when evidence of their preparations was in plain sight.
And they all treated Roran with a deference that he found unsettling. It manifested itself in small gestures:
offers of condolences for his misfor-tune, respectful silence whenever he spoke, and murmurs of assent
when he made a statement. It was as if his deeds had inflated his stature and in-timidated the people he
had known since childhood, distancing him from them.
I am branded,thought Roran, limping through the mud. He stopped at the edge of a puddle and bent to
examine his reflection, curious if he could discern what made him so different.
He saw a man in ragged, blood-stained clothes, with a humped back and a crooked arm tied across his
chest. His neck and cheeks were scum-bled with an impending beard, while his hair was matted into

snarled ropes that writhed in a halo around his head. Most frightening of all, though, were his eyes, which
had sunk deep into the sockets, giving him a haunted appearance. From within those two morbid
caverns, his gaze boiled like molten steel, full of loss, rage, and an obsessive craving.
A lopsided smile crept across Roran’s face, rendering his visage even more shocking. He liked how he
looked. It matched his feelings. Now he understood how he had managed to influence the villagers. He
bared his teeth. I can use this image. I can use it to destroy the Ra’zac.
Lifting his head, he slouched up the street, pleased with himself. Just then, Thane approached him and
grasped his left forearm in a hearty grip. “Stronghammer! You don’t know how glad I am to see you.”
“You are?” Roran wondered if the whole world had been turned inside out during the night.
Thane nodded vigorously. “Ever since we attacked the soldiers, every-thing has seemed hopeless to me.
It pains me to admit it, but so it was. My heart pounded all the time, like I was about to fall down a well;
my hands shook; and I felt dreadfully ill. I thought someone had poisoned me! It was worse than death.
But what you said yesterday healed me in-stantly and let me see purpose and meaning in the world again!
I... I can’t even explain the horror you saved me from. I am in your debt. If you need or want anything,
just ask and I’ll help.”
Moved, Roran gripped the farmer’s forearm in return and said, “Thank you, Thane. Thank you.” Thane
bowed his head, tears in his eyes, then released Roran and left him standing alone in the middle of the
street.
What have I done?
EXODUS

Awall of thick, smoky air engulfed Roran as he entered the Seven Sheaves, Morn’s tavern. He stopped
beneath the Urgal horns pegged over the door and let his eyes adjust to the dim interior. “Hello?” he
called.
The door to the back rooms banged open as Tara plowed forward, trailed by Morn. They both glared
sullenly at Roran. Tara planted her meaty fists on her hips and demanded, “What do you want here?”
Roran stared at her for a moment, trying to determine the source of her animosity. “Have you decided
whether to accompany me into the Spine?”
“That’s none of your business,” snapped Tara.
Oh yes, it is.He restrained himself, though, and instead said, “Whatever your intentions are, if you were
to go, Elain would like to know if you have room in your bags for a few more items, or if you need extra
room yourself. She has—”
“Extra room!” burst out Morn. He waved at the wall behind the bar, which was lined with oak casks. “I
have, packed in straw, twelve barrels of the clearest winter ale, which have been kept at the perfect
tempera-ture for the past five months. They were Quimby’s last batch! What am I supposed to do with
them? Or my hogsheads of lager and stout? If I leave them, the soldiers will dispose of it in a week, or
they’ll spike the barrels and pour the beer into the ground, where the only creatures who’ll enjoy it will be

grubs and worms. Oh!” Morn sat and wrung his hands, shaking his head. “Twelve years of work! Ever
since Father died I ran the tavern the same way he did, day in and day out. And then you and Eragon
had to cause this trouble. It...” He stopped, breathing with difficulty, and wiped his mashed face with the
edge of his sleeve.
“There, there now,” said Tara. She put her arm around Morn and jabbed a finger at Roran. “Who gave
you leave to stir up Carvahall with your fancy words? If we go, how will my poor husband make a living?
He can’t take his trade with him like Horst or Gedric. He can’t squat in an empty field and farm it like
you! Impossible! Everyone will go and we will starve. Or we will go and we will still starve. You have
ruined us!”
Roran looked from her flushed, angry face to Morn’s distraught one, then turned and opened the door.
He paused on the threshold and said in a low voice, “I have always counted you among my friends. I
would not have you killed by the Empire.” Stepping outside, he pulled his vest tight around himself and
paced away from the tavern, ruminating the whole way.
At Fisk’s well, he stopped for a drink and found himself joined by Birgit. She watched him struggle to
turn the crank with only one hand, then took it from him and brought up the water bucket, which she
passed to him without drinking. He sipped the cool liquid, then said, “I’m glad that you are coming.” He
handed the bucket back.
Birgit eyed him. “I recognize the force that drives you, Roran, for it propels me as well; we both wish to
find the Ra’zac. Once we do, though, I will have my compensation from you for Quimby’s death. Never
forget that.” She pushed the full bucket back into the well and let it fall unchecked, the crank spinning
wildly. A second later, the well ech-oed with a hollow splash.
Roran smiled as he watched her walk away. He was more pleased than upset by her declaration; he
knew that even if everyone else in Carvahall were to forsake the cause or die, Birgit would still help him
to hunt the Ra’zac. Afterward, though—if an afterward existed—he would have to pay her price or kill
her. That was the only way to resolve such matters.
By evening Horst and his sons had returned to the house, bearing two small bundles wrapped in oilcloth.
“Is that all?” asked Elain. Horst nodded curtly, lay the bundles on the kitchen table, and unwrapped them
to ex-pose four hammers, three tongs, a clamp, a medium-sized bellows, and a three-pound anvil.
As the five of them sat to dinner, Albriech and Baldor discussed the various people they had seen
making covert preparations. Roran listened intently, trying to keep track of who had lent donkeys to
whom, who showed no signs of departing, and who might need help to leave.
“The biggest problem,” said Baldor, “is food. We can only carry so much, and it’ll be difficult to hunt
enough in the Spine to feed two or three hundred people.”
“Mmm.” Horst shook his finger, his mouth full of beans, then swal-lowed. “No, hunting won’t work. We
have to bring our flocks with us. Combined, we own enough sheep and goats to feed the lot of us for a
month or more.”
Roran raised his knife. “Wolves.”
“I’m more worried about keeping the animals from wandering off into the forest,” replied Horst.
“Herding them will be a chore.”

Roran spent the following day assisting whomever he could, saying lit-tle, and generally allowing people
to see him working for the good of the village. Late that night, he tumbled into bed exhausted but hopeful.
The advent of dawn pierced Roran’s dreams and woke him with a sense of momentous expectation. He
stood and tiptoed downstairs, then went outside and stared at the misty mountains, absorbed by the
morn-ing’s silence. His breath formed a white plume in the air, but he felt warm, for his heart throbbed
with fear and eagerness.
After a subdued breakfast, Horst brought the horses to the front of the house, where Roran helped
Albriech and Baldor load them with saddle-bags and other bundles of supplies. Next Roran took up his
own pack, hissing as the leather shoulder strap pressed down on his injury.
Horst closed the door to the house. He lingered for a moment with his fingers on the steel doorknob,
then took Elain’s hand and said, “Let’s go.”
As they walked through Carvahall, Roran saw somber families gather-ing by their houses with their piles
of possessions and yammering live-stock. He saw sheep and dogs with bags tied on their backs,
teary-eyed children on donkeys, and makeshift sledges hitched to horses with crates of fluttering chickens
hung on each side. He saw the fruits of his success, and he knew not whether to laugh or to cry.
They stopped at Carvahall’s north end and waited to see who would join them. A minute passed, then
Birgit approached from the side, ac-companied by Nolfavrell and his younger siblings. Birgit greeted
Horst and Elain and stationed herself nearby.
Ridley and his family arrived outside the wall of trees, driving over a hundred sheep from the east side of
Palancar Valley. “I figured that it would be better to keep them out of Carvahall,” shouted Ridley over
the animals.
“Good thinking!” replied Horst.
Next came Delwin, Lenna, and their five children; Orval and his family; Loring with his sons; Calitha and
Thane—who gave Roran a large smile; and then Kiselt’s clan. Those women who had been recently
widowed, like Nolla, clustered around Birgit. Before the sun had cleared the moun-tain peaks, most of
the village had assembled along the wall. But not all.
Morn, Tara, and several others had yet to show themselves, and when Ivor arrived, it was without any
supplies. “You’re staying,” observed Ro-ran. He sidestepped a knot of testy goats that Gertrude was
attempting to restrain.
“Aye,” said Ivor, drawing out the word into a weary admission. He shivered, crossed his bony arms for
warmth, and faced the rising sun, lift-ing his head so as to catch the transparent rays. “Svart refused to
leave. Heh! It was like carving against the grain to get him into the Spine in the first place. Someone has
to look after him, an’ I don’t have any children, so...” He shrugged. “Doubt I could give up the farm
anyway.”
“What will you do when the soldiers arrive?”
“Give them a fight that they’ll remember.”
Roran laughed hoarsely and clapped Ivor on the arm, doing his best to ignore the unspoken fate that
they both knew awaited anyone who re-mained.

Page 471

A thin, middle-aged man, Ethlbert, marched to the edge of the congre-gation and shouted, “You’re all
fools!” With an ominous rustle, people turned to look at their accuser. “I’ve held my peace through this
madness, but I’ll not follow a nattering lunatic! If you weren’t blinded by his words, you’d see that he’s
leading you to destruction! Well, I won’t go! I’ll take my chances sneaking past the soldiers and finding
refuge in Therins-ford. They’re our own people at least, not the barbarians you’ll find in Surda.” He spat
on the ground, then spun on his heel and stomped away.
Afraid that Ethlbert might convince others to defect, Roran scanned the crowd and was relieved to see
nothing more than restless muttering. Still, he did not want to dawdle and give people a chance to change
their minds. He asked Horst under his breath, “How long should we wait?”
“Albriech, you and Baldor run around as fast as you can and check if anyone else is coming. Otherwise,
we’ll leave.” The brothers dashed off in opposite directions.
Half an hour later, Baldor returned with Fisk, Isold, and their borrowed horse. Leaving her husband,
Isold hurried toward Horst, shooing her hands at anyone who got in her way, oblivious to the fact that
most of her hair had escaped imprisonment in its bun and stuck out in odd tufts. She stopped, wheezing
for breath. “I am sorry we’re so late, but Fisk had trouble closing up the shop. He couldn’t pick which
planers or chisels to bring.” She laughed in a shrill tone, almost hysterical. “It was like watch-ing a cat
surrounded by mice trying to decide which one to chase. First this one, then that one.”
A wry smile tugged at Horst’s lips. “I understand perfectly.”
Roran strained for a glimpse of Albriech, but to no avail. He gritted his teeth. “Where is he?”
Horst tapped his shoulder. “Right over there, I do believe.”
Albriech advanced between the houses with three beer casks tied to his back and an aggrieved look that
was comic enough to make Baldor and several others laugh. On either side of Albriech walked Morn
and Tara, who staggered under the weight of their enormous packs, as did the don-key and two goats
that they towed behind them. To Roran’s astonish-ment, the animals were burdened with even more
casks.
“They won’t last a mile,” said Roran, growing angry at the couple’s fool-ishness. “And they don’t have
enough food. Do they expect us to feed them or—”
With a chuckle, Horst cut him off. “I wouldn’t worry about the food. Morn’s beer will be good for
morale, and that’s worth more than a few extra meals. You’ll see.”
As soon as Albriech had freed himself of the casks, Roran asked him and his brother, “Is that
everyone?” When they answered in the affirma-tive, Roran swore and struck his thigh with a clenched
fist. Excluding Ivor, three families were determined to remain in Palancar Valley: Ethl-bert’s, Parr’s, and
Knute’s. I can’t force them to come. He sighed. “All right. There’s no sense in waiting longer.”
Excitement rippled through the villagers; the moment had finally ar-rived. Horst and five other men pulled
open the wall of trees, then laid planks across the trench so that the people and animals could walk over.
Horst gestured. “I think that you should go first, Roran.”
“Wait!” Fisk ran up and, with evident pride, handed Roran a blackened six-foot-long staff of hawthorn

Page 472

wood with a knot of polished roots at the top, and a blued-steel ferrule that tapered into a blunt spike at
the base. “I made it last night,” said the carpenter. “I thought that you might have need of it.”
Roran ran his left hand over the wood, marveling at its smoothness. “I couldn’t have asked for anything
better. Your skill is masterful.... Thank you.” Fisk grinned and backed away.
Conscious of the fact that the entire crowd was watching, Roran faced the mountains and the Igualda
Falls. His shoulder throbbed beneath the leather strap. Behind him lay his father’s bones and everything
he had known in life. Before him the jagged peaks piled high into the pale sky and blocked his way and
his will. But he would not be denied. And he would not look back.
Katrina.
Lifting his chin, Roran strode forward. His staff knocked against the hard planks as he crossed the
trench and passed out of Carvahall, leading the villagers into the wilderness.
ON THE CRAGS OF TEL’NAEÍR

Thud.
Bright as a flaming sun, the dragon hung before Eragon and everyone clustered along the Crags of
Tel’naeír, buffeting them with gusts from its mighty wings. The dragon’s body appeared to be on fire as
the brilliant dawn illuminated its golden scales and sprayed the ground and trees with dazzling chips of
light. It was far larger than Saphira, large enough to be several hundred years old, and proportionally
thicker in its neck, limbs, and tail. Upon its back sat the Rider, robes startling white against the bril-liance
of the scales.
Eragon fell to his knees, his face upturned. I’m not alone.... Awe and re-lief coursed through him. No
more would he have to bear the responsi-bility of the Varden and of Galbatorix by himself. Here was one
of the guardians of old resurrected from the depths of time to guide him, a liv-ing symbol, and a testament
to the legends he had been raised with. Here was his master. Here was a legend!
As the dragon turned to land, Eragon gasped; the creature’s left foreleg had been severed by a terrible
blow, leaving a helpless white stump in place of the once mighty limb. Tears filled his eyes.
A whirlwind of dry twigs and leaves enveloped the hilltop as the dragon settled on the sweet clover and
folded its wings. The Rider care-fully descended from his steed along the dragon’s intact front right leg,
then approached Eragon, his hands clasped before him. He was an elf with silver hair, old beyond
measure, though the only sign of age was the expression of great compassion and sadness upon his face.
“Osthato Chetowä,” said Eragon. “The Mourning Sage... As you asked, I have come.” With a jolt, he
remembered his manners and touched his lips. “Atra esterní ono thelduin.”
The Rider smiled. He took Eragon by the shoulders and lifted him up-right, staring at him with such
kindness that Eragon could look at nothing else; he was consumed by the endless depths within the elf’s
eyes. “Oromis is my proper name, Eragon Shadeslayer.”
“You knew,” whispered Islanzadí with a hurt expression that quickly transformed into a storm of rage.
“You knew of Eragon’s existence and yet you did not tell me? Why have you betrayed me, Shur’tugal?”

Page 473

Oromis released Eragon from his gaze and transferred it onto the queen. “I kept my peace because it
was uncertain if Eragon or Arya would live long enough to come here; I had no wish to give you a fragile
hope that might have been torn away at any moment.”
Islanzadí spun about, her cape of swan feathers billowing like wings. “You had no right to withhold such
information from me! I could have sent warriors to protect Arya, Eragon, and Saphira in Farthen Dûr and
to escort them safely here.”
Oromis smiled sadly. “I hid nothing from you, Islanzadí, but what you had already chosen not to see. If
you had scryed the land, as is your duty, you would have discerned the source of the chaos that has
swept Ala-gaësia and learned the truth of Arya and Eragon. That you might forget the Varden and the
dwarves in your grief is understandable, but Brom? Vinr Älfakyn? The last of the Elf Friends? You have
been blind to the world, Islanzadí, and lax upon your throne. I could not risk driving you further away by
subjecting you to another loss.”
Islanzadí’s anger drained away, leaving her face pale and her shoulders slumped. “I am diminished,” she
whispered.
A cloud of hot, moist air pressed against Eragon as the gold dragon bent to examine him with eyes that
glittered and sparked. We are well met, Eragon Shadeslayer. I am Glaedr. His voice—for it was
unmistakably male—rumbled and shook through Eragon’s mind, like the growl of a mountain avalanche.
All Eragon could do was touch his lips and say, “I am honored.”
Then Glaedr brought his attention to bear on Saphira. She remained perfectly still, her neck arched stiffly
as Glaedr sniffed her cheek and along the line of her wing. Eragon saw Saphira’s clenched leg muscles
flutter with an involuntary tremor. You smell of humans, said Glaedr, and all you know of your own
race is what your instincts have taught you, but you have the heart of a true dragon.
During this silent exchange, Orik presented himself to Oromis. “Truly, this is beyond anything that I
dared hope or expect. You are a pleasant surprise in these dark times, Rider.” He clapped his fist over
his heart. “If it is not too presumptuous, I would ask a boon on behalf of my king and my clan, as was the
custom between our people.”
Oromis nodded. “And I will grant it if it is within my power.”
“Then tell me: Why have you remained hidden for all these years? You were sorely needed, Argetlam.”
“Ah,” said Oromis. “Many sorrows exist in this world, and one of the greatest is being unable to help
those in pain. I could not risk leaving this sanctuary, for if I had died before one of Galbatorix’s eggs had
hatched, then there would have been no one to pass on our secrets to the new Rider, and it would have
been even harder to defeat Galbatorix.”
“ Thatwas your reason?” spat Orik. “Those are the words of a coward! The eggs might have never
hatched.”
Everyone went deathly quiet, except for a faint growl that emanated from between Glaedr’s teeth. “If
you were not my guest here,” said Islan-zadí, “I would strike you down myself for that insult.”
Oromis spread his hands. “Nay, I am not offended. It is an apt reaction. Understand, Orik, that Glaedr

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

and I cannot fight. Glaedr has his disabil-ity, and I,” he touched the side of his head, “I am also maimed.
The For-sworn broke something within me when I was their captive, and while I can still teach and learn,
I can no longer control magic, except for the smallest of spells. The power escapes me, no matter how
much I struggle. I would be worse than useless in battle, I would be a weakness and a li-ability, one who
could easily be captured and used against you. So I re-moved myself from Galbatorix’s influence for the
good of the many, even though I yearned to openly oppose him.”
“The Cripple Who Is Whole,” murmured Eragon.
“Forgive me,” said Orik. He appeared stricken.
“It is of no consequence.” Oromis placed a hand on Eragon’s shoulder. “Islanzadí Dröttning, by your
leave?”
“Go,” she said wearily. “Go and be done with you.”
Glaedr crouched low to the ground, and Oromis nimbly climbed up his leg and into the saddle on his
back. “Come, Eragon and Saphira. We have much to talk about.” The gold dragon leaped off the cliff
and circled overhead, rising on an updraft.
Eragon and Orik solemnly clasped arms. “Bring honor to your clan,” said the dwarf.
As Eragon mounted Saphira, he felt as if he were about to embark on a long journey and that he should
say farewell to those who remained be-hind. Instead, he just looked at Arya and smiled, letting his
wonder and joy show. She half frowned, appearing troubled, but then he was gone, swept into the sky
by the eagerness of Saphira’s flight.
Together the two dragons followed the white cliff northward for sev-eral miles, accompanied only by the
sound of their wings. Saphira flew abreast of Glaedr. Her enthusiasm boiled over into Eragon’s mind,
heightening his own emotions.
They landed in another clearing situated on the edge of the cliff, just before the wall of exposed stone
crumbled back into the earth. A bare path led from the precipice to the doorstep of a low hut grown
between the trunks of four trees, one of which straddled a stream that emerged from the moody depths
of the forest. Glaedr would not fit inside; the hut could have easily sat between his ribs.
“Welcome to my home,” said Oromis as he alighted on the ground with uncommon ease. “I live here, on
the brink of the Crags of Tel’naeír, be-cause it provides me the opportunity to think and study in peace.
My mind works better away from Ellesméra and the distractions of other people.”
He disappeared inside the hut, then returned with two stools and flag-ons of clear, cold water for both
himself and Eragon. Eragon sipped his drink and admired the spacious view of Du Weldenvarden in an
attempt to conceal his awe and nervousness while he waited for the elf to speak. I’m in the presence of
another Rider! Beside him, Saphira crouched with her eyes fixed on Glaedr, slowly kneading the dirt
between her claws.
The gap in their conversation stretched longer and longer. Ten minutes passed... half an hour... then an
hour. It reached the point where Eragon began to measure the elapsed time by the sun’s progress. At
first his mind buzzed with questions and thoughts, but those eventually subsided into calm acceptance. He
enjoyed just observing the day.

Page 475

Only then did Oromis say, “You have learned the value of patience well. That is good.”
It took Eragon a moment to find his voice. “You can’t stalk a deer if you are in a hurry.”
Oromis lowered his flagon. “True enough. Let me see your hands. I find that they tell me much about a
person.” Eragon removed his gloves and allowed the elf to grip his wrists with thin, dry fingers. He
examined Er-agon’s calluses, then said, “Correct me if I am wrong. You have wielded a scythe and plow
more often than a sword, though you are accustomed to a bow.”
“Aye.”
“And you have done little writing or drawing, maybe none at all.”
“Brom taught me my letters in Teirm.”
“Mmm. Beyond your choice of tools, it seems obvious that you tend to be reckless and disregard your
own safety.”
“What makes you say that, Oromis-elda?” asked Eragon, using the most respectful and formal honorific
that he could think of.
“Not elda, ” corrected Oromis. “You may call me master in this tongue and ebrithil in the ancient
language, nothing else. You will extend the same courtesy to Glaedr. We are your teachers; you are our
students; and you will act with proper respect and deference.” Oromis spoke gently, but with the
authority of one who expects absolute obedience.
“Yes, Master Oromis.”
“As will you, Saphira.”
Eragon could sense how hard it was for Saphira to unbend her pride enough to say, Yes, Master.
Oromis nodded. “Now. Anyone with such a collection of scars has ei-ther been hopelessly unfortunate,
fights like a berserker, or deliberately pursues danger. Do you fight like a berserker?”
“No.”
“Nor do you seem unfortunate; quite the opposite. That leaves only one explanation. Unless you think
differently?”
Eragon cast his mind over his experiences at home and on the road, in an attempt to categorize his
behavior. “I would say, rather, that once I dedicate myself to a certain project or path, I see it through,
no matter the cost... especially if someone I love is in danger.” His gaze flicked to-ward Saphira.
“And do you undertake challenging projects?”
“I like to be challenged.”
“So you feel the need to pit yourself against adversity in order to test your abilities.”
“I enjoy overcoming challenges, but I’ve faced enough hardship to know that it’s foolish to make things

Page 476

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

more difficult than they are. It’s all I can do to survive as it is.”
“Yet you chose to follow the Ra’zac when it would have been easier to remain in Palancar Valley. And
you came here.”
“It was the right thing to do... Master.”
For several minutes, no one spoke. Eragon tried to guess what the elf was thinking, but could glean no
information from his masklike visage. Finally, Oromis stirred. “Were you, perchance, given a trinket of
some kind in Tarnag, Eragon? A piece of jewelry, armor, or even a coin?”
“Aye.” Eragon reached inside of his tunic and fished out the necklace with the tiny silver hammer.
“Gannel made this for me on Hrothgar’s or-ders, to prevent anyone from scrying Saphira or me. They
were afraid that Galbatorix might have discovered what I look like.... How did you know?”
“Because,” said Oromis, “I could no longer sense you.”
“Someone tried to scry me by Sílthrim about a week ago. Was that you?”
Oromis shook his head. “After I first scryed you with Arya, I had no need to use such crude methods to
find you. I could reach out and touch your mind with mine, as I did when you were injured in Farthen
Dûr.” Lifting the amulet, he murmured several lines in the ancient language, then released it. “It contains
no other spells I can detect. Keep it with you at all times; it is a valuable gift.” He pressed the tips of his
long fingers to-gether, his nails as round and bright as fish scales, and stared between the arches they
formed toward the white horizon. “Why are you here, Er-agon?”
“To complete my training.”
“And what do you think that process entails?”
Eragon shifted uncomfortably. “Learning more about magic and fight-ing. Brom wasn’t able to finish
teaching me everything that he knew.”
“Magic, swordsmanship, and other such skills are useless unless you know how and when to apply
them. This I will teach you. However, as Galbatorix has demonstrated, power without moral direction is
the most dangerous force in the world. My main task, then, is to help you, Eragon and Saphira, to
understand what principles guide you, so that you do not make the right choices for the wrong reasons.
You must learn more about yourself, who you are and what you are capable of doing. That is why you
are here.”
When do we begin?asked Saphira.
Oromis began to answer when he stiffened and dropped his flagon. His face went crimson and his
fingers tightened into hooked claws that dragged at his robe like cockleburs. The change was frightening
and in-stantaneous. Before Eragon could do more than flinch, the elf had relaxed again, although his
entire body now bespoke weariness.
Concerned, Eragon dared to ask, “Are you well?”
A trace of amusement lifted the corner of Oromis’s mouth. “Less so than I might wish. We elves fancy
ourselves immortal, but not even we can escape certain maladies of the flesh, which are beyond our

knowl-edge of magic to do more than delay. No, do not worry... it isn’t conta-gious, but neither can I rid
myself of it.” He sighed. “I have spent decades binding myself with hundreds of small, weak spells that,
layered one upon another, duplicate the effect of enchantments that are now beyond my reach. I bound
myself with them so that I might live long enough to witness the birth of the last dragons and to foster the
Riders’ resurrection from the ruin of our mistakes.”
“How long until...”
Oromis lifted a sharp eyebrow. “How long until I die? We have time, but precious little for you or me,
especially if the Varden decide to call upon your help. As a result—to answer your question,
Saphira—we will begin your instruction immediately, and we will train faster than any Rider ever has or
ever will, for I must condense decades of knowledge into months and weeks.”
“You do know,” said Eragon, struggling against the embarrassment and shame that made his cheeks
burn, “about my... my own infirmity. ” He ground out the last word, hating the sound of it. “I am as
crippled as you are.”
Sympathy tempered Oromis’s gaze, though his voice was firm. “Eragon, you are only a cripple if you
consider yourself one. I understand how you feel, but you must remain optimistic, for a negative outlook
is more of a handicap than any physical injury. I speak from personal experience. Pity-ing yourself serves
neither you nor Saphira. I and the other spellweavers will study your malady to see if we might devise a
way to alleviate it, but in the meantime, your training will proceed as if nothing were amiss.”
Eragon’s gut clenched and he tasted bile as he considered the implica-tions. Surely Oromis wouldn’t
make me endure that torment again! “The pain is unbearable,” he said frantically. “It would kill me.
I—”
“No, Eragon. It will not kill you. That much I know about your curse. However, we both have our duty;
you to the Varden, and I to you. We cannot shirk it for the sake of mere pain. Far too much is at risk,
and we can ill afford to fail.” All Eragon could do was shake his head as panic threatened to overwhelm
him. He tried to deny Oromis’s words, but their truth was inescapable. “Eragon. You must accept this
burden freely. Have you no one or nothing that you are willing to sacrifice yourself for?”
His first thought was of Saphira, but he was not doing this for her. Nor for Nasuada. Nor even for Arya.
What drove him, then? When he had pledged fealty to Nasuada, he had done so for the good of Roran
and the other people trapped within the Empire. But did they mean enough to him to put himself through
such anguish? Yes, he decided. Yes, they do, because I am the only one who has a chance to help
them, and because I won’t be free of Galbatorix’s shadow until they are as well. And because this
is my only purpose in life. What else would I do? He shuddered as he mouthed the ghastly phrase, “I
accept on behalf of those I fight for: the people of Alagaësia—of all races—who have suffered from
Galbatorix’s brutality. No matter the pain, I swear that I will study harder than any student you’ve had
before.”
Oromis nodded gravely. “I ask for nothing less.” He looked at Glaedr for a moment, then said, “Stand
and remove your tunic. Let me see what you are made of.”
Wait,said Saphira. Was Brom aware of your existence here, Master? Er-agon paused, struck by the
possibility.
“Of course,” said Oromis. “He was my pupil as a boy in Ilirea. I am glad that you gave him a proper
burial, for he had a hard life and few enough ever showed him kindness. I hope that he found peace

before he entered the void.”
Eragon slowly frowned. “Did you know Morzan as well?”
“He was my apprentice before Brom.”
“And Galbatorix?”
“I was one of the Elders who denied him another dragon after his first was killed, but no, I never had the
misfortune to teach him. He made sure to personally hunt down and kill each of his mentors.”
Eragon wanted to inquire further, but he knew that it would be better to wait, so he stood and unlaced
the top of his tunic. It seems , he said to Saphira, that we will never learn all of Brom’s secrets. He
shivered as he pulled off the tunic in the cool air, then squared his shoulders and lifted his chest.
Oromis circled him, stopping with an astonished exclamation as he saw the scar that crossed Eragon’s
back. “Did not Arya or one of the Varden’s healers offer to remove this weal? You should not have to
carry it.”
“Arya did offer, but...” Eragon stopped, unable to articulate his feelings. Finally, he just said, “It’s part of
me now, just as Murtagh’s scar is part of him.”
“Murtagh’s scar?”
“Murtagh bore a similar mark. It was inflicted when his father, Morzan, threw Zar’roc at him while he
was only a child.”
Oromis stared at him seriously for a long time before he nodded and moved on. “You have a fair amount
of muscle, and you are not as lop-sided as most swordsmen. Are you ambidextrous?”
“Not really, but I had to teach myself to fight with my left hand after I broke my wrist by Teirm.”
“Good. That will save some time. Clasp your hands behind your back and lift them as high as possible.”
Eragon did as he was told, but the pos-ture hurt his shoulders and he could barely make his hands meet.
“Now bend forward while keeping your knees straight. Try to touch the ground.” This was even harder
for Eragon; he ended up bowed like a hunchback, with his arms hanging uselessly by his head while his
ham-strings twinged and burned. His fingers were still nine or ten inches from the ground. “At least you
can stretch without hurting yourself. I had not hoped for so much. You can perform a number of
exercises for flexibility without overexerting. Yes.”
Then Oromis addressed Saphira: “I would know your capabilities as well, dragon.” He gave her a
number of complex poses that had her con-tort every foot of her sinuous length in fantastic ways,
culminating in a series of aerial acrobatics the likes of which Eragon had never seen before. Only a few
things exceeded her ability, such as executing a backward loop while corkscrewing through the air.
When she landed, it was Glaedr who said, I fear that we coddled the Riders. If our hatchlings had
been forced to care for themselves in the wild—as you were, and so our ancestors were—then
perhaps they would have possessed your skill.
“No,” said Oromis, “even if Saphira had been raised on Vroengard using the established methods, she
would still be an extraordinary flier. I’ve rarely seen a dragon so naturally suited to the sky.” Saphira

blinked, then shuffled her wings and busied herself cleaning one of her claws in a man-ner that hid her
head from view. “You have room to improve, as do we all, but little, very little.” The elf reseated himself,
his back perfectly straight.
For the next five hours, by Eragon’s reckoning, Oromis delved into every aspect of his and Saphira’s
knowledge, from botany to woodwork-ing to metallurgy and medicine, although he mainly concentrated
on their grasp of history and the ancient language. The interrogation comforted Eragon, as it reminded
him of how Brom used to quiz him during their long treks to Teirm and Dras-Leona.
When they broke for lunch, Oromis invited Eragon into his house, leaving the two dragons alone. The
elf’s quarters were barren except for those few essentials necessary for food, hygiene, and the pursuit of
an in-tellectual life. Two entire walls were dotted with cubbyholes that held hundreds of scrolls. Next to
the table hung a golden sheath—the same color as Glaedr’s scales—and a matching sword with a blade
the color of iridescent bronze.
On the inner pane of the door, set within the heart of the wood, was a flat panel one span high and two
wide. It depicted a beautiful, towering city built against an escarpment and caught in the ruddy light of a
rising harvest moon. The pitted lunar face was bisected by the horizon and ap-peared to sit on the ground
like a maculated dome as large as a mountain. The picture was so clear and perfectly detailed, Eragon at
first took it to be a magical window; it was only when he saw that the image was indeed static that he
could accept it as a piece of art.
“Where is this?” he asked.
Oromis’s slanted features tightened for an instant. “You would do well to memorize that landscape,
Eragon, for there lies the heart of your mis-ery. You see what was once our city of Ilirea. It was burned
and aban-doned during Du Fyrn Skulblaka and became the capital of the Broddring Kingdom and now
is the black city of Urû’baen. I made that fairth on the night that I and others were forced to flee our
home before Galbatorix arrived.”
“You painted this... fairth?”
“No, no such thing. A fairth is an image fixed by magic upon a square of polished slate that is prepared
beforehand with layers of pigments. The landscape upon that door is exactly how Ilirea presented itself to
me at the moment I uttered my spell.”
“And,” said Eragon, unable to stop the flow of questions, “what was the Broddring Kingdom?”
Oromis’s eyes widened with dismay. “You don’t know?” Eragon shook his head. “How can you not?
Considering your circumstances and the fear that Galbatorix wields among your people, I might
understand that you were raised in darkness, ignorant of your heritage. But I cannot credit Brom with
being so lax with your instruction as to neglect subjects that even the youngest elf or dwarf knows. The
children of your Varden could tell me more about the past.”
“Brom was more concerned with keeping me alive than teaching me about people who are already
dead,” retorted Eragon.
This drew silence from Oromis. Finally, he said, “Forgive me. I did not mean to impugn Brom’s
judgment, only I am impatient beyond reason; we have so little time, and each new thing you must learn
reduces that which you can master during your tenure here.” He opened a series of cupboards hidden
within the curved wall and removed bread rolls and bowls of fruit, which he rowed out on the table. He

Page 480

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

paused for a mo-ment over the food with his eyes closed before beginning to eat. “The Broddring
Kingdom was the human’s country before the Riders fell. After Galbatorix killed Vrael, he flew on Ilirea
with the Forsworn and deposed King Angrenost, taking his throne and titles for his own. The Broddring
Kingdom then formed the core of Galbatorix’s conquests. He added Vro-engard and other lands to the
east and south to his holdings, creating the empire you are familiar with. Technically, the Broddring
Kingdom still exists, though, at this point, I doubt that it is much more than a name on royal decrees.”
Afraid to pester the elf with further inquiries, Eragon concentrated on his food. His face must have
betrayed him, though, because Oromis said, “You remind me of Brom when I chose him as my
apprentice. He was younger than you, only ten, but his curiosity was just as great. I doubt I heard aught
from him for a year but how, what, when, and, above all else, why. Do not be shy to ask what lies in
your heart.”
“I want to know so much,” whispered Eragon. “Who are you? Where do you come from?... Where did
Brom come from? What was Morzan like? How, what, when, why ? And I want to know everything
about Vroengard and the Riders. Maybe then my own path will be clearer.”
Silence fell between them as Oromis meticulously disassembled a blackberry, prying out one plump
segment at a time. When the last cor-puscle vanished between his port-red lips, he rubbed his hands flat
to-gether—“polishing his palms,” as Garrow used to say—and said, “Know this about me, then: I was
born some centuries past in our city of Lu-thivíra, which stood in the woods by Lake Tüdosten. At the
age of twenty, like all elf children, I was presented to the eggs that the dragons had given the Riders, and
Glaedr hatched for me. We were trained as Riders, and for near a century, we traveled the world over,
doing Vrael’s will. Eventually, the day arrived when it was deemed appropriate for us to retire and pass
on our experience to the next generation, so we took a position in Ilirea and taught new Riders, one or
two at a time, until Gal-batorix destroyed us.”
“And Brom?”
“Brom came from a family of illuminators in Kuasta. His mother was Nelda and his father Holcomb.
Kuasta is so isolated by the Spine from the rest of Alagaësia, it has become a peculiar place, full of
strange cus-toms and superstitions. When he was still new to Ilirea, Brom would knock on a door frame
three times before entering or leaving a room. The human students teased him about it until he abandoned
the practice along with some of his other habits.
“Morzan was my greatest failure. Brom idolized him. He never left his side, never contradicted him, and
never believed that he could best Mor-zan in any venture. Morzan, I’m ashamed to admit—for it was
within my power to stop—was aware of this and took advantage of Brom’s devotion in a hundred
different ways. He grew so proud and cruel that I consid-ered separating him from Brom. But before I
could, Morzan helped Gal-batorix to steal a dragon hatchling, Shruikan, to replace the one Galba-torix
had lost, killing the dragon’s original Rider in the process. Morzan and Galbatorix then fled together,
sealing our doom.
“You cannot begin to fathom the effect Morzan’s betrayal had on Brom until you understand the depth
of Brom’s affection for him. And when Galbatorix at last revealed himself and the Forsworn killed
Brom’s dragon, Brom focused all of his anger and pain on the one who he felt was responsible for the
destruction of his world: Morzan.”
Oromis paused, his face grave. “Do you know why losing your dragon, or vice versa, usually kills the
survivor?”

Page 481

“I can imagine,” said Eragon. He quailed at the thought.
“The pain is shock enough—although it isn’t always a factor—but what really causes the damage is
feeling part of your mind, part of your iden-tity, die. When it happened to Brom, I fear that he went mad
for a time. After I was captured and escaped, I brought him to Ellesméra for safety, but he refused to
stay, instead marching with our army to the plains of Ilirea, where King Evandar was slain.
“The confusion then was indescribable. Galbatorix was busy consolidat-ing his power, the dwarves were
in retreat, the southwest was a mass of war as the humans rebelled and fought to create Surda, and we
had just lost our king. Driven by his desire for vengeance, Brom sought to use the turmoil to his
advantage. He gathered together many of those who had been exiled, freed some who had been
imprisoned, and with them he formed the Varden. He led them for a few years, then surrendered the
position to another so that he was free to pursue his true passion, which was Morzan’s downfall. Brom
personally killed three of the Forsworn, in-cluding Morzan, and he was responsible for the deaths of five
others. He was rarely happy during his life, but he was a good Rider and a good man, and I am honored
to have known him.”
“I never heard his name mentioned in connection to the Forsworn’s deaths,” objected Eragon.
“Galbatorix did not want to publicize the fact that any still existed who could defeat his servants. Much
of his power resides in the appearance of invulnerability.”
Once again, Eragon was forced to revise his conception of Brom, from the village storyteller that Eragon
had first taken him to be, to the warrior and magician he had traveled with, to the Rider he was at last
revealed as, and now firebrand, revolutionary leader, and assassin. It was hard to rec-oncile all of those
roles. I feel as if I barely knew him. I wish that we had had a chance to talk about all of this at
least once. “He was a good man,” agreed Eragon.
He looked out one of the round windows that faced the edge of the cliff and allowed the afternoon
warmth to suffuse the room. He watched Saphira, noting how she acted with Glaedr, seeming both shy
and coy. One moment she would twist around to examine some feature of the clearing, the next she
would shuffle her wings and make small advances on the larger dragon, weaving her head from side to
side, the tip of her tail twitching as if she were about to pounce on a deer. She reminded Er-agon of a
kitten trying to bait an old tomcat into playing with her, only Glaedr remained impassive throughout her
machinations.
Saphira,he said. She responded with a distracted flicker of her thoughts, barely acknowledging him.
Saphira, answer me.
What?
I know you’re excited, but don’t make a fool of yourself.
You’ve made a fool of yourself plenty of times,she snapped.
Her reply was so unexpected, it stunned him. It was the sort of casually cruel remark that humans often
make, but that he had never thought to hear from her. He finally managed to say, That doesn’t make it
any better. She grunted and closed her mind to his, although he could still feel the thread of her emotions
connecting them.
Eragon returned to himself to find Oromis’s gray eyes heavy upon him. The elf’s gaze was so perceptive,

Page 482

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Eragon was sure that Oromis under-stood what had transpired. Eragon forced a smile and motioned
toward Saphira. “Even though we’re linked, I can never predict what she’s going to do. The more I learn
about her, the more I realize how different we are.”
Then Oromis made his first statement that Eragon thought was truly wise: “Those whom we love are
often the most alien to us.” The elf paused. “She is very young, as are you. It took Glaedr and I decades
be-fore we fully understood each other. A Rider’s bond with his dragon is like any relationship—that is,
a work in progress. Do you trust her?”
“With my life.”
“And does she trust you?”
“Yes.”
“Then humor her. You were brought up as an orphan. She was brought up to believe that she was the
last sane individual of her entire race. And now she has been proved wrong. Don’t be surprised if it takes
some months before she stops pestering Glaedr and returns her attention to you.”
Eragon rolled a blueberry between his thumb and forefinger; his appe-tite had vanished. “Why don’t
elves eat meat?”
“Why should we?” Oromis held up a strawberry and rotated it so that the light reflected off its dimpled
skin and illuminated the tiny hairs that bearded the fruit. “Everything that we need or want we sing from
the plants, including our food. It would be barbaric to make animals suffer that we might have additional
courses on the table.... Our choice will make greater sense to you before long.”
Eragon frowned. He had always eaten meat and did not look forward to living solely on fruit and
vegetables while in Ellesméra. “Don’t you miss the taste?”
“You cannot miss that which you have never had.”
“What about Glaedr, though? He can’t live off grass.”
“No, but neither does he needlessly inflict pain. We each do the best we can with what we are given.
You cannot help who or what you are born as.”
“And Islanzadí? Her cape was made of swan feathers.”
“Loose feathers gathered over the course of many years. No birds were killed to make her garment.”
They finished the meal, and Eragon helped Oromis to scour the dishes clean with sand. As the elf
stacked them in the cupboard, he asked, “Did you bathe this morning?” The question startled Eragon, but
he answered that no, he had not. “Please do so tomorrow then, and every day follow-ing.”
“Every day! The water’s too cold for that. I’ll catch the ague.”
Oromis eyed him oddly. “Then make it warmer.”
Now it was Eragon’s turn to look askance. “I’m not strong enough to heat an entire stream with magic,”
he protested.

Page 483

The house echoed as Oromis laughed. Outside, Glaedr swung his head toward the window and
inspected the elf, then returned to his earlier po-sition. “I assume that you explored your quarters last
night.” Eragon nod-ded. “And you saw a small room with a depression in the floor?”
“I thought that it might be for washing clothes or linens.”
“It is for washing you. Two nozzles are concealed in the side of the wall above the hollow. Open them
and you can bathe in water of any tem-perature. Also,” he gestured at Eragon’s chin, “while you are my
student, I expect you to keep yourself clean-shaven until you can grow a full beard—if you so
choose—and not look like a tree with half its leaves blown off. Elves do not shave, but I will have a razor
and mirror found and sent to you.”
Wincing at the blow to his pride, Eragon agreed. They returned out-side, whereupon Oromis looked at
Glaedr and the dragon said, We have decided upon a curriculum for Saphira and you.
The elf said, “You will start—”
—an hour after sunrise tomorrow, in the time of the Red Lily. Return here then.
“And bring the saddle that Brom made for you, Saphira,” continued Oromis. “Do what you wish in the
meantime; Ellesméra holds many wonders for a foreigner, if you care to see them.”
“I’ll keep that in mind,” said Eragon, bowing his head. “Before I go, Mas-ter, I want to thank you for
helping me in Tronjheim after I killed Durza. I doubt that I would have survived without your assistance. I
am in your debt.”
We are both in your debt,added Saphira.
Oromis smiled slightly and inclined his head.
THE SECRET LIVES OF ANTS

The moment that Oromis and Glaedr were out of sight, Saphira said,
Eragon, another dragon! Can you believe it?
He patted her shoulder. It’s wonderful. High above Du Weldenvarden, the only sign of habitation in the
forest was an occasional ghostly plume of smoke that rose from the crown of a tree and soon faded into
clear air.
I never expected to encounter another dragon, except for Shruikan. Maybe rescue the eggs from
Galbatorix, yes, but that was the extent of my hopes. And now this!She wriggled underneath him with
joy. Glaedr is incredible, isn’t he? He’s so old and strong and his scales are so bright. He must be
two, no, three times bigger than me. Did you see his claws? They...
She continued on in that manner for several minutes, waxing eloquent about Glaedr’s attributes. But
stronger than her words were the emotions Eragon sensed roiling within her: eagerness and enthusiasm,
twined over what he could only identify as a longing adoration.

Page 484

Eragon tried to tell Saphira what he had learned from Oromis—since he knew that she had not paid
attention—but he found it impossible to change the subject of conversation. He sat silently on her back,
the world an emerald ocean below, and felt himself the loneliest man in existence.
Back at their quarters, Eragon decided against any sightseeing; he was far too tired from the day’s
events and the weeks of traveling. And Saphira was more than content to sit on her bed and chatter
about Glaedr while he examined the mysteries of the elves’ wash closet.
Morning came, and with it a package wrapped in onionskin paper con-taining the razor and mirror that
Oromis had promised. The blade was of elvish make, so it needed no sharpening or stropping.
Grimacing, Eragon first bathed in steaming hot water, then held up the mirror and con-fronted his visage.
I look older. Older and worn.Not only that, but his features had be-come far more angled, giving him an
ascetic, hawklike appearance. He was no elf, but neither would anyone take him to be a purebred human
if they inspected him closely. Pulling back his hair, he bared his ears, which now tapered to slight points,
more evidence of how his bond with Saphira had changed him. He touched one ear, letting his fingers
wander over the unfamiliar shape.
It was difficult for him to accept the transformation of his flesh. Even though he had known it would
occur—and occasionally welcomed the prospect as the last confirmation that he was a Rider—the reality
of it filled him with confusion. He resented the fact that he had no say in how his body was being altered,
yet at the same time he was curious where the process would take him. Also, he was aware that he was
still in the midst of his own, human adolescence, and its attendant realm of myster-ies and difficulties.
When will I finally know who and what I am?
He placed the edge of the razor against his cheek, as he had seen Gar-row do, and dragged it across his
skin. The hairs came free, but they were cut long and ragged. He altered the angle of the blade and tried
again with a bit more success.
When he reached his chin, though, the razor slipped in his hand and cut him from the corner of his mouth
to the underside of his jaw. He howled and dropped the razor, clapping his hand over the incision, which
poured blood down his neck. Spitting the words past bared teeth, he said, “Waíse heill.” The pain
quickly receded as magic knitted his flesh back together, though his heart still pounded from the shock.
Eragon!cried Saphira. She forced her head and shoulders into the vesti-bule and nosed open the door to
the closet, flaring her nostrils at the scent of blood.
I’ll live,he assured her.
She eyed the sanguine water. Be more careful. I’d rather you were as ragged as a molting deer
than have you decapitate yourself for the sake of a close shave.
So would I. Go on, I’m fine.
Saphira grunted and reluctantly withdrew.
Eragon sat, glaring at the razor. Finally, he muttered, “Forget this.” Composing himself, he reviewed his
store of words from the ancient lan-guage, selected those that he needed, and then allowed his invented
spell to roll off his tongue. A faint stream of black powder fell from his face as his stubble crumbled into

Page 485

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

dust, leaving his cheeks perfectly smooth.
Satisfied, Eragon went and saddled Saphira, who immediately took to the air, aiming their course toward
the Crags of Tel’naeír. They landed before the hut and were met by Oromis and Glaedr.
Oromis examined Saphira’s saddle. He traced each strap with his fin-gers, pausing on the stitching and
buckles, and then pronounced it pass-able handiwork considering how and when it had been
constructed. “Brom was always clever with his hands. Use this saddle when you must travel with great
speed. But when comfort is allowed—” He stepped into his hut for a moment and reappeared carrying a
thick, molded saddle decorated with gilt designs along the seat and leg pieces. “—use this. It was crafted
in Vroengard and imbued with many spells so that it will never fail you in time of need.”
Eragon staggered under the weight of the saddle as he received it from Oromis. It had the same general
shape as Brom’s, with a row of buckles— intended to immobilize his legs—hanging from each side. The
deep seat was sculpted out of the leather in such a way that he could fly for hours with ease, both sitting
upright and lying flat against Saphira’s neck. Also, the straps encircling Saphira’s chest were rigged with
slips and knots so that they could extend to accommodate years of growth. A series of broad ties on
either side of the head of the saddle caught Eragon’s atten-tion. He asked their purpose.
Glaedr rumbled, Those secure your wrists and arms so that you are not killed like a rat shaken to
death when Saphira performs a complex maneu-ver.
Oromis helped Eragon relieve Saphira of her current saddle. “Saphira, you will go with Glaedr today,
and I will work with Eragon here.”
As you wish,she said, and crowed with excitement. Heaving his golden bulk off the ground, Glaedr
soared off to the north, Saphira close behind.
Oromis did not give Eragon long to ponder Saphira’s departure; the elf marched him to a square of
hard-packed dirt beneath a willow tree at the far side of the clearing. Standing opposite him in the
square, Oromis said, “What I am about to show you is called the Rimgar, or the Dance of Snake and
Crane. It is a series of poses that we developed to prepare our warriors for combat, although all elves
use it now to maintain their health and fitness. The Rimgar consists of four levels, each more difficult than
the last. We will start with the first.”
Apprehension for the coming ordeal sickened Eragon to the point where he could barely move. He
clenched his fists and hunched his shoulders, his scar tugging at the skin of his back as he glared between
his feet.
“Relax,” advised Oromis. Eragon jerked open his hands and let them hang limply at the end of his rigid
arms. “I asked you to relax, Eragon. You can’t do the Rimgar if you are as stiff as a piece of rawhide.”
“Yes, Master.” Eragon grimaced and reluctantly loosened his muscles and joints, although a knot of
tension remained coiled in his belly.
“Place your feet together and your arms at your sides. Look straight ahead. Now take a deep breath
and lift your arms over your head so that your palms meet.... Yes, like that. Exhale and bend down as far
as you can, put your palms on the ground, take another breath... and jump back. Good. Breathe in and
bend up, looking toward the sky... and exhale, lift-ing your hips until you form a triangle. Breathe in
through the back of your throat... and out. In... and out. In...”

Page 486

To Eragon’s utter relief, the stances proved gentle enough to hold with-out igniting the pain in his back,
yet challenging enough that sweat beaded his forehead and he panted for breath. He found himself
grinning with joy at his reprieve. His wariness evaporated and he flowed through the postures—most of
which far exceeded his flexibility—with more en-ergy and confidence than he had possessed since before
the battle in Far-then Dûr. Maybe I’ve healed!
Oromis performed the Rimgar with him, displaying a level of strength and flexibility that astounded
Eragon, especially for one so old. The elf could touch his forehead to his toes. Throughout the exercise,
Oromis remained impeccably composed, as if he were doing no more than stroll-ing down a garden path.
His instruction was calmer and more patient than Brom’s, yet completely unyielding. No deviation was
allowed from the correct path.
“Let us wash the sweat from our limbs,” said Oromis when they fin-ished.
Going to the stream by the house, they quickly disrobed. Eragon sur-reptitiously watched the elf, curious
as to what he looked like without his clothes. Oromis was very thin, yet his muscles were perfectly
defined, etched under his skin with the hard lines of a woodcut. No hair grew upon his chest or legs, not
even around his groin. His body seemed al-most freakish to Eragon, compared to the men he was used
to seeing in Carvahall—although it had a certain refined elegance to it, like that of a wildcat.
When they were clean, Oromis took Eragon deep into Du Welden-varden to a hollow where the dark
trees leaned inward, obscuring the sky behind branches and veils of snarled lichen. Their feet sank into
the moss above their ankles. All was silent about them.
Pointing to a white stump with a flat, polished top three yards across that rested in the center of the
hollow, Oromis said, “Sit here.” Eragon did as he was told. “Cross your legs and close your eyes.” The
world went dark around him. From his right, he heard Oromis whisper, “Open your mind, Eragon. Open
your mind and listen to the world around you, to the thoughts of every being in this glade, from the ants in
the trees to the worms in the ground. Listen until you can hear them all and you under-stand their purpose
and nature. Listen, and when you hear no more, come tell me what you have learned.”
Then the forest was quiet.
Unsure if Oromis had left, Eragon tentatively lowered the barriers around his mind and reached out with
his consciousness, like he did when trying to contact Saphira at a great distance. Initially only a void
surrounded him, but then pricks of light and warmth began to appear in the darkness, strengthening until
he sat in the midst of a galaxy of swirl-ing constellations, each bright point representing a life. Whenever
he had contacted other beings with his mind, like Cadoc, Snowfire, or Solem-bum, the focus had always
been on the one he wanted to communicate with. But this... this was as if he had been standing deaf in the
midst of a crowd and now he could hear the rivers of conversation whirling around him.
He felt suddenly vulnerable; he was completely exposed to the world. Anyone or anything that might
want to leap into his mind and control him could now do so. He tensed unconsciously, withdrawing back
into himself, and his awareness of the hollow vanished. Remembering one of Oromis’s lessons, Eragon
slowed his breathing and monitored the sweep of his lungs until he had relaxed enough to reopen his
mind.
Of all the lives he could sense, the majority were, by far, insects. Their sheer number astounded him.
Tens of thousands dwelled in a square foot of moss, teeming millions throughout the rest of the small
hollow, and uncounted masses beyond. Their abundance actually frightened Eragon. He had always
known that humans were scarce and beleaguered in Ala-gaësia, but he had never imagined that they

Page 487

were so outnumbered by even beetles.
Since they were one of the few insects that he was familiar with, and Oromis had mentioned them,
Eragon concentrated his attention on the columns of red ants marching across the ground and up the
stems of a wild rosebush. What he gleaned from them were not so much thoughts—their brains were too
primitive—but urges: the urge to find food and avoid injury, the urge to defend one’s territory, the urge to
mate. By examining the ants’ instincts, he could begin to puzzle out their behavior.
It fascinated him to discover that—except for the few individuals ex-ploring outside the borders of their
province—the ants knew exactly where they were going. He was unable to ascertain what mechanism
guided them, but they followed clearly defined paths from their nest to food and back. Their source of
food was another surprise. As he had ex-pected, the ants killed and scavenged other insects, but most of
their ef-forts were directed toward the cultivation of... of something that dotted the rosebush. Whatever
the life-form was, it was barely large enough for him to sense. He focused all of his strength on it in an
attempt to identify it and satisfy his curiosity.
The answer was so simple, he laughed out loud when he compre-hended it: aphids. The ants were
acting as shepherds for aphids, driving and protecting them, as well as extracting sustenance from them
by mas-saging the aphids’ bellies with the tips of their antennae. Eragon could hardly believe it, but the
longer he watched, the more he became con-vinced that he was correct.
He traced the ants underground into their complex matrix of warrens and studied how they cared for a
certain member of their species that was several times bigger than a normal ant. However, he was unable
to determine the insect’s purpose; all he could see were servants swarming around it, rotating it, and
removing the specks of matter it produced at regular intervals.
After a time, Eragon decided that he had gleaned all the information from the ants that he could—unless
he was willing to sit there for the rest of the day—and was about to return to his body when a squirrel
jumped into the glade. Its appearance was like a blast of light to him, at-tuned as he was to the insects.
Stunned, he was overwhelmed by a rush of sensations and feelings from the animal. He smelled the forest
with its nose, felt the bark give under his hooked claws and the air swish through his upraised plume of a
tail. Compared to an ant, the squirrel burned with energy and possessed unquestionable intelligence.
Then it leaped to another branch and faded from his awareness.
The forest seemed much darker and quieter than before when Eragon opened his eyes. He took a deep
breath and looked about, appreciating for the first time how much life existed in the world. Unfolding his
cramped legs, he walked over to the rosebush.
He bent down and examined the branches and twigs. Sure enough, aphids and their crimson guardians
clung to them. And near the base of the plant was the mound of pine needles that marked the entrance to
the ants’ lair. It was strange to see with his own eyes; none of it betrayed the numerous and subtle
interactions that he was now aware of.
Engrossed in his thoughts, Eragon returned to the clearing, wondering what he might be crushing under
his feet with every step. When he emerged from under the trees’ shelter, he was startled by how far the
sun had fallen. I must have been sitting there for at least three hours.
He found Oromis in his hut, writing with a goose-feather quill. The elf finished his line, then wiped the nib
of the quill clean, stoppered his ink, and asked, “And what did you hear, Eragon?”

Page 488

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Eragon was eager to share. As he described his experience, he heard his voice rise with enthusiasm over
the details of the ants’ society. He re-counted everything that he could recall, down to the minutest and
most inconsequential observation, proud of the information that he had gath-ered.
When he finished, Oromis raised an eyebrow. “Is that all?”
“I...” Dismay gripped Eragon as he understood that he had somehow missed the point of the exercise.
“Yes, Ebrithil.”
“And what about the other organisms in the earth and the air? Can you tell me what they were doing
while your ants tended their droves?”
“No, Ebrithil.”
“Therein lies your mistake. You must become aware of all things equally and not blinker yourself in order
to concentrate on a particular subject. This is an essential lesson, and until you master it, you will
medi-tate on the stump for an hour each day.”
“How will I know when I have mastered it?”
“When you can watch one and know all.”
Oromis motioned for Eragon to join him at the table, then set a fresh sheet of paper before him, along
with a quill and a bottle of ink. “So far you have made do with an incomplete knowledge of the ancient
lan-guage. Not that any of us knows all the words in the language, but you must be familiar with its
grammar and structure so that you do not kill yourself through an incorrectly placed verb or similar
mistake. I do not expect you to speak our language like an elf—that would take a life-time—but I do
expect you to achieve unconscious competence. That is, you must be able to use it without thinking.
“In addition, you must learn to read and write the ancient language. Not only will this help you to
memorize words, it is an essential skill if you need to compose an especially long spell and you don’t trust
your mem-ory, or if you find such a spell recorded and you want to use it.
“Every race has evolved their own system of writing the ancient lan-guage. The dwarves use their runic
alphabet, as do humans. They are only makeshift techniques, though, and are incapable of expressing the
lan-guage’s true subtleties as well as our Liduen Kvaedhí, the Poetic Script. The Liduen Kvaedhí was
designed to be as elegant, beautiful, and precise as possible. It is composed of forty-two different shapes
that represent various sounds. These shapes can be combined in a nearly infinite range of glyphs that
represent both individual words and entire phrases. The symbol on your ring is one such glyph. The
symbol on Zar’roc is an-other.... Let us start: What are the basic vowel sounds of the ancient
lan-guage?”
“What?”
Eragon’s ignorance of the underpinnings of the ancient language quickly became apparent. When he had
traveled with Brom, the old storyteller had concentrated on having Eragon memorize lists of words that
he might need to survive, as well as perfecting his pronunciation. In those two areas, he excelled, but he
could not even explain the difference be-tween a definite and indefinite article. If the gaps in his education
frus-trated Oromis, the elf did not betray it through word or action, but la-bored persistently to mend
them.

Page 489

At a certain point during the lesson, Eragon commented, “I’ve never needed very many words in my
spells; Brom said it was a gift that I could do so much with just brisingr. I think the most I ever said in
the ancient language was when I spoke to Arya in her mind and when I blessed an orphan in Farthen
Dûr.”
“You blessed a child in the ancient language?” asked Oromis, suddenly alert. “Do you remember how
you worded this blessing?”
“Aye.”
“Recite it for me.” Eragon did so, and a look of pure horror engulfed Oromis. He exclaimed, “You used
skölir ! Are you sure? Wasn’t it sköliro ?”
Eragon frowned. “No, skölir. Why shouldn’t I have used it? Skölir means shielded. ‘... and may you be
shielded from misfortune.’ It was a good blessing.”
“That was no blessing, but a curse.” Oromis was more agitated than Er-agon had ever seen him. “The
suffix o forms the past tense of verbs end-ing with r and i. Sköliro means shielded, but skölir means
shield. What you said was ‘May luck and happiness follow you and may you be a shield from
misfortune.’ Instead of protecting this child from the vagaries of fate, you condemned her to be a sacrifice
for others, to absorb their misery and suffering so that they might live in peace.”
No, no! It can’t be!Eragon recoiled from the possibility. “The effect a spell has isn’t only determined by
the word’s sense, but also by your in-tent, and I didn’t intend to harm—”
“You cannot gainsay a word’s inherent nature. Twist it, yes. Guide it, yes. But not contravene its
definition to imply the very opposite.” Oromis pressed his fingers together and stared at the table, his lips
reduced to a flat white line. “I will trust that you did not mean harm, else I would re-fuse to teach you
further. If you were honest and your heart was pure, then this blessing may cause less evil than I fear,
though it will still be the nucleus of more pain than either of us could wish.”
Violent trembling overtook Eragon as he realized what he had done to the child’s life. “It may not undo
my mistake,” he said, “but perhaps it will alleviate it; Saphira marked the girl on the brow, just like she
marked my palm with the gedwëy ignasia.”
For the first time in his life, Eragon witnessed an elf dumbstruck. Oromis’s gray eyes widened, his mouth
opened, and he clutched the arms of his chair until the wood groaned with protest. “One who bears the
sign of the Riders, and yet is not a Rider,” he murmured. “In all my years, I have never met anyone such
as the two of you. Every decision you make seems to have an impact far beyond what anyone could
anticipate. You change the world with your whims.”
“Is that good or bad?”
“Neither, it just is. Where is the babe now?”
It took a moment for Eragon to compose his thoughts. “With the Varden, either in Farthen Dûr or
Surda. Do you think that Saphira’s mark will help her?”
“I know not,” said Oromis. “No precedent exists to draw upon for wis-dom.”
“There must be ways to remove the blessing, to negate a spell.” Eragon was almost pleading.

Page 490

“There are. But for them to be most effective, you should be the one to apply them, and you cannot be
spared here. Even under the best of cir-cumstances, remnants of your magic will haunt this girl evermore.
Such is the power of the ancient language.” He paused. “I see that you understand the gravity of the
situation, so I will say this only once: you bear full re-sponsibility for this girl’s doom, and, because of the
wrong you did her, it is incumbent upon you to help her if ever the opportunity should arise. By the
Riders’ law, she is your shame as surely as if you had begotten her out of wedlock, a disgrace among
humans, if I remember correctly.”
“Aye,” whispered Eragon. “I understand.” I understand that I forced a de-fenseless baby to pursue a
certain destiny without ever giving her a choice in the matter. Can someone be truly good if they
never have the opportunity to act badly? I made her a slave. He also knew that if he had been bound
in that manner without permission, he would hate his jailer with every fiber of his being.
“Then we will speak of this no more.”
“Yes, Ebrithil.”
Eragon was still subdued, even depressed, by the end of the day. He barely looked up when they went
outside to meet Saphira and Glaedr upon their return. The trees shook from the fury of the gale that the
two dragons created with their wings. Saphira seemed proud of herself; she arched her neck and
pranced toward Eragon, opening her chops in a lu-pine grin.
A stone cracked under Glaedr’s weight as the ancient dragon turned a giant eye—as large as a dinner
platter—on Eragon and asked, What are the rules three to spotting downdrafts, and the rules five
for escaping them?
Startled out of his reverie, Eragon could only blink dumbly. “I don’t know.”
Then Oromis confronted Saphira and asked, “What creatures do ants farm, and how do they extract
food from them?”
I wouldn’t know,declared Saphira. She sounded affronted.
A gleam of anger leaped into Oromis’s eyes and he crossed his arms, though his expression remained
calm. “After all the two of you have done together, I would think that you had learned the most basic
lesson of being Shur’tugal: Share everything with your partner. Would you cut off your right arm? Would
you fly with only one wing? Never. Then why would you ignore the bond that links you? By doing so,
you reject your greatest gift and your advantage over any single opponent. Nor should you just talk to
each other with your minds, but rather mingle your con-sciousnesses until you act and think as one. I
expect both of you to know what either one of you is taught.”
“What about our privacy?” objected Eragon.
Privacy?said Glaedr. Keep your thoughts to thyself when you leave here, if it pleases you, but while
we tutor you, you have no privacy.
Eragon looked at Saphira, feeling even worse than before. She avoided his gaze, then stamped a foot
and faced him directly. What?
They’re right. We have been negligent.

Page 491

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

It’s not my fault.
I didn’t say that it was.She had guessed his opinion, though. He re-sented the attention she lavished on
Glaedr and how it drew her away from him. We’ll do better, won’t we?
Of course!she snapped.
She declined to offer Oromis and Glaedr an apology, though, leaving the task to Eragon. “We won’t
disappoint you again.”
“See that you don’t. You will be tested tomorrow on what the other learned.” Oromis revealed a round
wood bauble nestled in the middle of his palm. “So long as you take care to wind it regularly, this device
will wake you at the proper time each morning. Return here as soon as you have bathed and eaten.”
The bauble was surprisingly heavy when Eragon took it. The size of a walnut, it had been carved with
deep whorls around a knob wrought in the likeness of a moss-rose blossom. He turned the knob
experimentally and heard three clicks as a hidden ratchet advanced. “Thank you,” he said.
UNDER THE MENOA TREE

After Eragon and Saphira had said their farewells, they flew back to their tree house with Saphira’s new
saddle dangling between her front claws. Without acknowledging the fact, they gradually opened their
minds and allowed their connection to widen and deepen, though neither of them consciously reached for
the other. Eragon’s tumultuous emotions must have been strong enough for Saphira to sense anyway,
though, for she asked, What happened, then?
A throbbing pain built up behind his eyes as he explained the terrible crime he had committed in Farthen
Dûr. Saphira was as appalled by it as he was. He said, Your gift may help that girl, but what I did is
inexcusable and will only hurt her.
The blame isn’t all yours. I share your knowledge of the ancient language, and I didn’t spot the error any
more than you did.When Eragon remained silent, she added, At least your back didn’t cause any
trouble today. Be grateful for that.
He grunted, unwilling to be tempted out of his black mood. And what did you learn this fine day?
How to identify and avoid dangerous weather patterns.She paused, ap-parently ready to share the
memories with him, but he was too busy worrying about his distorted blessing to inquire further. Nor
could he bear the thought of being so intimate right then. When he did not pursue the matter, Saphira
withdrew into a taciturn silence.
Back in their bedroom, he found a tray of food by the screen door, as he had the previous night.
Carrying the tray to his bed—which had been remade with fresh linens—he settled down to eat, cursing
the lack of meat. Already sore from the Rimgar, he propped himself up with pillows and was about to
take his first bite when there came a gentle rapping at the opening to his chamber. “Enter,” he growled.
He took a drink of wa-ter.
Eragon nearly choked as Arya stepped through the doorway. She had abandoned the leather clothes

Page 492

she usually wore in favor of a soft green tunic cinched at the waist with a girdle adorned with
moonstones. She had also removed her customary headband, allowing her hair to tumble around her face
and over her shoulders. The biggest change, however, was not so much in her dress but her bearing; the
brittle tension that had permeated her demeanor ever since Eragon first met her was now gone.
She seemed to have finally relaxed.
He scrambled to his feet, noticing that her own were bare. “Arya! Why are you here?”
Touching her first two fingers to her lips, she said, “Do you plan on spending another evening inside?”
“I—”
“You have been in Ellesméra for three days now, and yet you have seen nothing of our city. I know that
you always wished to explore it. Set aside your weariness this once and accompany me.” Gliding toward
him, she took Zar’roc from where it lay by his side and beckoned to him.
He rose from the bed and followed her into the vestibule, where they descended through the trapdoor
and down the precipitous staircase that wound around the rough tree trunk. Overhead, the gathering
clouds glowed with the sun’s last rays before it was extinguished behind the edge of the world.
A piece of bark fell on Eragon’s head and he looked up to see Saphira leaning out of their bedroom,
gripping the wood with her claws. Without opening her wings, she sprang into the air and dropped the
hundred or so feet to the ground, landing in a thunderous cloud of dirt. I’m coming.
“Of course,” said Arya, as if she expected nothing less. Eragon scowled; he had wanted to be alone with
her, but he knew better than to com-plain.
They walked under the trees, where dusk already extended its tendrils from inside hollow logs, dark
crevices in boulders, and the underside of knobby eaves. Here and there, a gemlike lantern twinkled
within the side of a tree or at the end of a branch, casting gentle pools of light on either side of the path.
Elves worked on various projects in and around the lanterns’ radius, solitary except for a few, rare
couples. Several elves sat high in the trees, playing mellifluous tunes on their reed pipes, while others
stared at the sky with peaceful expressions—neither awake nor asleep. One elf sat cross-legged before a
pottery wheel that whirled round and round with a steady rhythm while a delicate urn took form beneath
his hands. The werecat, Maud, crouched beside him in the shadows, watching his pro-gress. Her eyes
flared silver as she looked at Eragon and Saphira. The elf followed her gaze and nodded to them without
halting his work.
Through the trees, Eragon glimpsed an elf—man or woman, he could not tell—squatting on a rock in the
middle of a stream, muttering a spell over the orb of glass clutched in its hands. He twisted his neck in an
at-tempt to get an unobstructed view, but the spectacle had already van-ished into the dark.
“What,” asked Eragon, keeping his voice low so as to not disturb any-one, “do most elves do for a
living or profession?”
Arya answered just as quietly. “Our strength with magic grants us as much leisure as we desire. We
neither hunt nor farm, and, as a result, we spend our days working to master our interests, whatever they
might be. Very little exists that we must strive for.”

Page 493

Through a tunnel of dogwood draped with creepers, they entered the enclosed atrium of a house grown
out of a ring of trees. An open-walled hut occupied the center of the atrium, which sheltered a forge and
an as-sortment of tools that Eragon knew even Horst would covet.
An elf woman held a pair of small tongs in a nest of molten coals, working bellows with her right hand.
With uncanny speed, she pulled the tongs from the fire—revealing a ring of white-hot steel clamped in the
pincers’ jaws—looped the ring through the edge of an incomplete mail corselet hung over the anvil,
grasped a hammer, and welded shut the open ends of the ring with a blow and a burst of sparks.
Only then did Arya approach. “Atra esterní ono thelduin.”
The elf faced them, her neck and cheek lit from underneath by the coals’ bloody light. Like taut wires
embedded in her skin, her face was scribed with a delicate pattern of lines—the greatest display of age
Er-agon had seen in an elf. She gave no response to Arya, which he knew was offensive and
discourteous, especially since the queen’s daughter had honored her by speaking first.
“Rhunön-elda, I have brought you the newest Rider, Eragon Shade-slayer.”
“I heard you were dead,” said Rhunön to Arya. Rhunön’s voice guttered and rasped unlike any other
elf’s. It reminded Eragon of the old men of Carvahall who sat on the porches outside their houses,
smoking pipes and telling stories.
Arya smiled. “When did you last leave your house, Rhunön?”
“You should know. It was that Midsummer’s Feast you forced me to at-tend.”
“That was three years ago.”
“Was it?” Rhunön frowned as she banked the coals and covered them with a grated lid. “Well, what of
it? I find company trying. A gaggle of meaningless chatter that...” She glared at Arya. “Why are we
speaking this foul language? I suppose you want me to forge a sword for him? You know I swore to
never create instruments of death again, not after that traitor of a Rider and the destruction he wreaked
with my blade.”
“Eragon already has a sword,” said Arya. She raised her arm and pre-sented Zar’roc to the smith.
Rhunön took Zar’roc with a look of wonder. She caressed the wine-red sheath, lingered on the black
symbol etched into it, rubbed a bit of dirt from the hilt, then wrapped her fingers around the handle and
drew the sword with all the authority of a warrior. She sighted down each of Zar’roc’s edges and flexed
the blade between her hands until Eragon feared it might break. Then, in a single movement, Rhunön
swung Zar’roc over her head and brought it down upon the tongs on her anvil, riving them in half with a
resounding ring.
“Zar’roc,” said Rhunön. “I remember thee.” She cradled the weapon like a mother would her firstborn.
“As perfect as the day you were finished.” Turning her back, she looked up at the knotted branches
while she traced the curves of the pommel. “My entire life I spent hammering these swords out of ore.
Then he came and destroyed them. Centuries of effort obliterated in an instant. So far as I knew, only
four examples of my art still existed. His sword, Oromis’s, and two others guarded by families who
managed to rescue them from the Wyrdfell.”
Wyrdfell?Eragon dared ask Arya with his mind.

Page 494

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Another name for the Forsworn.
Rhunön turned on Eragon. “Now Zar’roc has returned to me. Of all my creations, this I least expected
to hold again, save for his. How came you to possess Morzan’s sword?”
“It was given to me by Brom.”
“Brom?” She hefted Zar’roc. “Brom... I remember Brom. He begged me to replace the sword he had
lost. Truly, I wished to help him, but I had already taken my oath. My refusal angered him beyond
reason. Oromis had to knock him unconscious before he would leave.”
Eragon seized on the information with interest. “Your handiwork has served me well, Rhunön-elda. I
would be long dead were it not for Zar’roc. I killed the Shade Durza with it.”
“Did you now? Then some good has come of it.” Sheathing Zar’roc, Rhunön returned it to him, though
not without reluctance, then looked past him to Saphira. “Ah. Well met, Skulblaka.”
Well met, Rhunön-elda.
Without bothering to ask permission, Rhunön went up to Saphira’s shoulder and tapped a scale with one
of her blunt fingernails, twisting her head from side to side in an attempt to peer into the translucent
pebble. “Good color. Not like those brown dragons, all muddy and dark. Properly speaking, a Rider’s
sword should match the hue of his dragon, and this blue would have made a gorgeous blade....” The
thought seemed to drain the energy from her. She returned to the anvil and stared at the wrecked tongs,
as if the will to replace them had deserted her.
Eragon felt that it would be wrong to end the conversation on such a depressing note, but he could not
think of a tactful way to change the subject. The glimmering corselet caught his attention and, as he
studied it, he was astonished to see that every ring was welded shut. Because the tiny links cooled so
quickly, they usually had to be welded before being attached to the main piece of mail, which meant that
the finest mail— such as Eragon’s hauberk—was composed of links that were alternately welded and
riveted closed. Unless, it seemed, the smith possessed an elf’s speed and precision.
Eragon said, “I’ve never seen the equal of your mail, not even among the dwarves. How do you have
the patience to weld every link? Why don’t you just use magic and save yourself the work?”
He hardly expected the burst of passion that animated Rhunön. She tossed her short-cropped hair and
said, “And rob myself of all pleasure in this task? Aye, every other elf and I could use magic to satisfy our
de-sires—and some do—but then what meaning is there in life? How would you fill your time? Tell me.”
“I don’t know,” he confessed.
“By pursuing that which you love the most. When you can have any-thing you want by uttering a few
words, the goal matters not, only the journey to it. A lesson for you. You’ll face the same dilemma one
day, if you live long enough.... Now begone! I am weary of this talk.” With that Rhunön plucked the lid
off the forge, retrieved a new pair of tongs, and immersed a ring in the coals while she worked the
bellows with single-minded intensity.
“Rhunön-elda,” said Arya, “remember, I will return for you on the eve of the Agaetí Blödhren.” A grunt
was her only reply.

Page 495

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

The rhythmic peal of steel on steel, as lonely as the cry of a death bird in the night, accompanied them
back through the dogwood tunnel and onto the path. Behind them, Rhunön was no more than a black
figure bowed over the sullen glow of her forge.
“She made all the Riders’ swords?” asked Eragon. “Every last one?”
“That and more. She’s the greatest smith who has ever lived. I thought that you should meet her, for her
sake and yours.”
“Thank you.”
Is she always so brusque?asked Saphira.
Arya laughed. “Always. For her, nothing matters except her craft, and she’s famously impatient with
anything—or anyone—that interferes with it. Her eccentricities are well tolerated, though, because of her
incredible skill and accomplishments.”
While she spoke, Eragon tried to work out the meaning of Agaetí Blödhren. He was fairly sure that
blödh stood for blood and, as a result, that blödhren was blood-oath, but he had never heard of agaetí
.
“Celebration,”explained Arya when he asked. “We hold the Blood-oath Celebration once every century
to honor our pact with the dragons. Both of you are fortunate to be here now, for it is nigh upon us....”
Her slanted eyebrows met as she frowned. “Fate has indeed arranged a most auspi-cious coincidence.”
She surprised Eragon by leading them deeper into Du Weldenvarden, down paths tangled with nettles
and currant bushes, until the lights around them vanished and they entered the restless wilderness. In the
darkness, Eragon had to rely on Saphira’s keen night vision so as to not lose his way. The craggy trees
increased in width, crowding closer and closer together and threatening to form an impenetrable barrier.
Just when it appeared that they could go no farther, the forest ended and they entered a clearing washed
with moonlight from the bright sickle low in the eastern sky.
A lone pine tree stood in the middle of the clearing. No taller than the rest of its brethren, it was thicker
than a hundred regular trees combined; in comparison, they looked as puny as windblown saplings. A
blanket of roots radiated from the tree’s massive trunk, covering the ground with bark-sheathed veins
that made it seem as if the entire forest flowed out from the tree, as if it were the heart of Du
Weldenvarden itself. The tree presided over the woods like a benevolent matriarch, protecting its
in-habitants under the shelter of her branches.
“Behold the Menoa tree,” whispered Arya. “We observe the Agaetí Blödhren in her shade.”
A cold tingle crawled down Eragon’s side as he recognized the name. After Angela told his fortune in
Teirm, Solembum had come up to him and said, When the time comes and you need a weapon, look
under the roots of the Menoa tree. Then, when all seems lost and your power is insufficient, go to
the rock of Kuthian and speak your name to open the Vault of Souls . Eragon could not imagine
what kind of weapon might be buried under the tree, nor how he would go about finding it.
Do you see anything?he asked Saphira.
No, but then I doubt that Solembum’s words will make sense until our need is clear.

Page 496

Eragon told Arya about both parts of the werecat’s counsel, although— as he had with Ajihad and
Islanzadí—he kept Angela’s prophecy a secret because of its personal nature, and because he feared
that it might lead Arya to guess his attraction to her.
When he finished, Arya said, “Werecats rarely offer help, and when they do, it’s not to be ignored. So
far as I know, no weapon is hidden here, not even in song or legend. As for the Rock of Kuthian... the
name echoes in my head like a voice from a half-forgotten dream, familiar yet strange. I’ve heard it
before, though I cannot recall where.”
As they approached the Menoa tree, Eragon’s attention was caught by the multitude of ants crawling
over the roots. Faint black smudges were all he could see of the insects, but Oromis’s assignment had
sensitized him to the currents of life around him, and he could feel the ants’ primi-tive consciousness with
his mind. He lowered his defenses and allowed his awareness to flood outward, lightly touching Saphira
and Arya and then expanding beyond them to see what else lived in the clearing.
With unexpected suddenness, he encountered an immense entity, a sentient being of such a colossal
nature, he could not grasp the limits of its psyche. Even Oromis’s vast intellect, which Eragon had been in
con-tact with in Farthen Dûr, was dwarfed in comparison to this presence. The very air seemed to thrum
with the energy and strength that ema-nated from... the tree?
The source was unmistakable.
Deliberate and inexorable, the tree’s thoughts moved at a measured pace as slow as the creep of ice
over granite. It took no notice of Eragon nor, he was sure, of any single individual. It was entirely
concerned with the affairs of things that grow and flourish in the bright sunlight, with the dogbane and the
lily, the evening primrose and the silky foxglove and the yellow mustard tall beside the crabapple with its
purple blossoms.
“It’s awake!” exclaimed Eragon, shocked into speaking. “I mean... it’s in-telligent.” He knew that
Saphira felt it too; she cocked her head toward the Menoa tree, as if listening, then flew to one of its
branches, which were as thick as the road from Carvahall to Therinsford. There she perched with her tail
hanging free, waving the tip of it back and forth, ever so gracefully. It was such an odd sight, a dragon in
a tree, that Eragon almost laughed.
“Of course she’s awake,” said Arya. Her voice was low and mellow in the night air. “Shall I tell you the
story of the Menoa tree?”
“I’d like that.”
A flash of white streaked across the sky, like a banished specter, and re-solved itself beside Saphira in
the form of Blagden. The raven’s narrow shoulders and crooked neck gave him the appearance of a
miser basking in the radiance of a pile of gold. The raven lifted his pallid head and ut-tered his ominous
cry, “ Wyrda!”
“This is what happened. Once there lived a woman, Linnëa, in the years of spice and wine before our
war with the dragons and before we became as immortal as any beings still composed of vulnerable flesh
can be. Lin-nëa had grown old without the comfort of a mate or children, nor did she feel the need to
seek them out, preferring to occupy herself with the art of singing to plants, of which she was a master.
That is, she did until a young man came to her door and beguiled her with words of love. His affections
woke a part of Linnëa that she had never suspected existed, a craving to experience the things that she

had unknowingly sacrificed. The offer of a second chance was too great an opportunity for her to ignore.
She deserted her work and devoted herself to the young man and, for a time, they were happy.
“But the young man was young, and he began to long for a mate closer to his own age. His eye fell upon
a young woman, and he wooed and won her. And for a time, they too were happy.
“When Linnëa discovered that she had been spurned, scorned, and abandoned, she went mad with
grief. The young man had done the worst possible thing; he had given her a taste of the fullness of life,
then torn it away with no more thought than a rooster flitting from one hen to the next. She found him with
the woman and, in her fury, she stabbed him to death.
“Linnëa knew that what she had done was evil. She also knew that even if she was exonerated of the
murder, she could not return to her previous existence. Life had lost all joy for her. So she went to the
oldest tree in Du Weldenvarden, pressed herself against it, and sang herself into the tree, abandoning all
allegiance to her own race. For three days and three nights she sang, and when she finished, she had
become one with her be-loved plants. And through all the millennia since has she kept watch over the
forest.... Thus was the Menoa tree created.”
At the conclusion of her tale, Arya and Eragon sat side by side on the crest of a huge root, twelve feet
off the ground. Eragon bounced his heels against the tree and wondered if Arya had intended the story as
a warning to him or if it was merely an innocent piece of history.
His doubt hardened into certainty when she asked, “Do you think that the young man was to blame for
the tragedy?”
“I think,” he said, knowing that a clumsy reply could turn her against him, “that what he did was cruel...
and that Linnëa overreacted. They were both at fault.”
Arya stared at him until he was forced to avert his gaze. “They weren’t suited for each other.”
Eragon began to deny it but then stopped himself. She was right. And she had maneuvered him so that
he had to say it out loud, so that he had to say it to her. “Perhaps,” he admitted.
Silence accumulated between them like sand piling into a wall that nei-ther of them was willing to breach.
The high-pitched hum of cicadas echoed from the edge of the clearing. At last he said, “Being home
seems to agree with you.”
“It does.” With unconscious ease, she leaned over and picked up a thin branch that had fallen from the
Menoa tree and began to weave the clumps of needles into a small basket.
Hot blood rushed to Eragon’s face as he watched her. He hoped that the moon was not bright enough
to reveal that his cheeks had turned mottled red. “Where... where do you live? Do you and Islanzadí
have a palace or castle... ?”
“We live in Tialdarí Hall, our family’s ancestral buildings, in the west-ern part of Ellesméra. I would
enjoy showing our home to you.”
“Ah.” A practical question suddenly intruded in Eragon’s muddled thoughts, driving away his
embarrassment. “Arya, do you have any sib-lings?” She shook her head. “Then you are the sole heir to
the elven throne?”

“Of course. Why do you ask?” She sounded bemused by his curiosity.
“I don’t understand why you were allowed to become an ambassador to the Varden and dwarves, as
well as ferry Saphira’s egg from here to Tron-jheim. It’s too dangerous an errand for a princess, much
less the queen-in-waiting.”
“You mean it’s too dangerous for a human woman. I told you before that I am not one of your helpless
females. What you fail to realize is that we view our monarchs differently than you or the dwarves. To us,
a king or queen’s highest responsibility is to serve their people however and wherever possible. If that
means forfeiting our lives in the process, we welcome the opportunity to prove our devotion to—as the
dwarves say—hearth, hall, and honor. If I had died in the course of my duty, then a replacement
successor would have been chosen from among our vari-ous Houses. Even now I would not be required
to become queen if I found the prospect distasteful. We do not choose leaders who are unwill-ing to
devote themselves wholeheartedly to their obligation.” She hesi-tated, then hugged her knees against her
chest and propped her chin on them. “I had many years to perfect those arguments with my mother.” For
a minute, the wheet-wheet of the cicadas went undisturbed in the clearing. Then she asked, “How go
your studies with Oromis?”
Eragon grunted as his foul temper returned on a wave of unpleasant memories, souring his pleasure at
being with Arya. All he wanted to do was crawl into bed, go to sleep, and forget the day. “Oromis-elda,”
he said, working each word around his mouth before letting it escape, “is quite thorough.”
He winced as she gripped his upper arm with bruising strength. “What has gone amiss?”
He tried to shrug her hand off. “Nothing.”
“I’ve traveled with you long enough to know when you’re happy, an-gry... or in pain. Did something
happen between you and Oromis? If so, you have to tell me so that it can be rectified as soon as
possible. Or was it your back? We could—”
“It’s not my training!” Despite his pique, Eragon noticed that she seemed genuinely concerned, which
pleased him. “Ask Saphira. She can tell you.”
“I want to hear it from you,” she said quietly.
The muscles in Eragon’s jaw spasmed as he clenched his teeth. In a low voice, no more than a whisper,
he first described how he had failed at his meditation in the glade, then the incident that poisoned his heart
like a viper coiled in his chest: his blessing.
Arya released his arm and clutched at the root of the Menoa tree, as if to steady herself. “Barzûl.” The
dwarf curse alarmed him; he had never heard her use profanity before, and this one was particularly apt,
for it meant ill fate. “I knew of your act in Farthen Dûr, for sure, but I never thought... I never suspected
that such a thing could occur. I cry your par-don, Eragon, for forcing you to leave your rooms tonight. I
did not com-prehend your discomfort. You must want to be alone.”
“No,” he said. “No, I appreciate the company and the things you’ve shown me.” He smiled at her, and
after a moment, she smiled back. To-gether they sat small and still at the base of the ancient tree and
watched the moon arch high over the peaceful forest before it hid behind the gathering clouds. “I only
wonder what will become of the child.”
High above their heads, Blagden ruffled his bone-white feathers and shrieked, “Wyrda!”

A MAZE OF OPPOSITION

Nasuada crossed her arms without bothering to conceal her impatience as she examined the two men
before her.
The one on the right had a neck so thick, it forced his head to jut for-ward at nearly right angles to his
shoulders, giving him a stubborn, dim-witted appearance. This was intensified by his heavy brow with its
two cliffs of matted hair—almost long enough to pull over his eyes—and bul-bous lips that remained
puckered into a pink mushroom, even when he spoke. She knew better than to put stock in his repulsive
looks, though. No matter its rough housing, his tongue was as clever as a jester’s.
The only identifying feature of the second man was his pale skin, which refused to darken under Surda’s
relentless sun, even though the Varden had been in Aberon, the capital, for some weeks now. From his
coloring, Nasuada guessed he had been born in the northern reaches of the Empire. He held a knit wool
cap that he wrung into a hard rope between his hands.
“You,” she said, pointing at him. “How many of your chickens did he kill again?”
“Thirteen, Ma’am.”
Nasuada returned her attention to the ugly man. “An unlucky number, by all accounts, Master Gamble.
And so it has proved for you. You are guilty of both theft and destroying someone else’s property
without of-fering proper recompense.”
“I never denied it.”
“I only wonder how you ate thirteen chickens in four days. Are you ever full, Master Gamble?”
He gave her a jocular grin and scratched the side of his face. The rasp of his untrimmed fingernails over
his stubble annoyed her, and it was only with an effort of will that she kept from asking him to stop.
“Well, not to be disrespectful, Ma’am, but filling my stomach wouldn’t be a problem if you fed us
properly, what with all the work we do. I’m a large man, an’ I need a bit o’ meat in my belly after half a
day breaking rocks with a mat-tock. I did my best to resist temptation, I did. But three weeks of short
rations and watching these farmers drive around fat livestock they wouldn’t share even if a body were
starving... Well, I’ll admit, it broke me. I’m not a strong man when it comes to food. I like it hot and I like
plenty of it. An’ I don’t fancy I’m the only one willing to help himself.”
And that’s the heart of the problem,reflected Nasuada. The Varden could not afford to feed its
members, not even with Surda’s king, Orrin, helping. Orrin had opened his treasury to them, but he had
refused to behave as Galbatorix was wont to do when moving his army across the Empire, which was to
appropriate supplies from his countrymen without paying for them. A noble sentiment, but one that
only makes my task harder. Still, she knew that acts like those were what separated her, Orrin,
Hrothgar, and Islanzadí from Galbatorix’s despotism. It would be so easy to cross that divide without
noticing it.
“I understand your reasons, Master Gamble. However, although the Varden aren’t a country and we
answer to no one’s authority but our own, that does not give you or anyone else leave to ignore the rule
of law as laid down by my predecessors or as it’s observed here in Surda. There-fore, I order you to

Page 500

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

pay a copper for each chicken you stole.”
Gamble surprised her by acceding without protest. “As you wish, Ma’am,” he said.
“That’s it?” exclaimed the pale man. He wrung his cap even tighter. “That’s no fair price. If I sold them
in any market, they’d—”
She could not contain herself any longer. “Yes! You’d get more. But I happen to know that Master
Gamble cannot afford to give you the chickens’ full price, as I’m the one who provides his salary! As I
do yours. You forget that if I decided to acquire your poultry for the good of the Varden, you’d get no
more than a copper a chicken and be lucky at that. Am I understood?”
“He can’t—”
“Am I understood?”
After a moment, the pale man subsided and muttered, “Yes, Ma’am.”
“Very well. You’re both dismissed.” With an expression of sardonic admiration, Gamble touched his
brow and bowed to Nasuada before backing out of the stone room with his sullen opponent. “You too,”
she said to the guards on either side of the door.
As soon as they were gone, she slumped in her chair with an exhausted sigh and reached for her fan,
batting it over her face in a futile attempt to dissipate the pinpricks of sweat that accumulated on her
forehead. The constant heat drained her strength and made even the smallest task ardu-ous.
She suspected she would feel tired even if it were winter. Familiar as she was with the innermost secrets
of the Varden, it still had taken more work than she expected to transport the entire organization from
Farthen Dûr, through the Beor Mountains, and deliver them to Surda and Aberon. She shuddered,
remembering long, uncomfortable days spent in the saddle. Planning and executing their departure had
been exceedingly difficult, as was integrating the Varden into their new surroundings while simultaneously
preparing for an attack on the Empire. I don’t have enough time each day to solve all these
problems, she lamented.
Finally, she dropped the fan and rang the bellpull, summoning her handmaid, Farica. The banner hanging
to the right of the cherrywood desk rippled as the door hidden behind it opened. Farica slipped out to
stand with downcast eyes by Nasuada’s elbow.
“Are there any more?” asked Nasuada.
“No, Ma’am.”
She tried not to let her relief show. Once a week, she held an open court to resolve the Varden’s
various disputes. Anyone who felt that they had been wronged could seek an audience with her and ask
for her judg-ment. She could not imagine a more difficult and thankless chore. As her father had often
said after negotiating with Hrothgar, “A good compro-mise leaves everyone angry.” And so it seemed.
Returning her attention to the matter at hand, she told Farica, “I want that Gamble reassigned. Give him
a job where his talent with words will be of some use. Quartermaster, perhaps, just so long as it’s a job
where he’ll get full rations. I don’t want to see him before me for stealing again.”

Farica nodded and went to the desk, where she recorded Nasuada’s in-structions on a parchment
scroll. That skill alone made her invaluable. Farica asked, “Where can I find him?”
“One of the work gangs in the quarry.”
“Yes, Ma’am. Oh, while you were occupied, King Orrin asked that you join him in his laboratory.”
“What has he done in there now, blind himself?” Nasuada washed her wrists and neck with lavender
water, then checked her hair in the mirror of polished silver that Orrin had given her and tugged on her
overgown until the sleeves were straight.
Satisfied with her appearance, she swept out of her chambers with Farica in tow. The sun was so bright
today that no torches were needed to illuminate the inside of Borromeo Castle, nor could their added
warmth have been tolerated. Shafts of light fell through the crossletted arrow slits and glowed upon the
inner wall of the corridor, striping the air with bars of golden dust at regular intervals. Nasuada looked
out one embrasure toward the barbican, where thirty or so of Orrin’s orange-clad cavalry soldiers were
setting forth on another of their ceaseless rounds of patrols in the countryside surrounding Aberon.
Not that they could do much good if Galbatorix decided to attack us him-self,she thought bitterly. Their
only protection against that was Galba-torix’s pride and, she hoped, his fear of Eragon. All leaders were
aware of the risk of usurpation, but usurpers themselves were doubly afraid of the threat that a single
determined individual could pose. Nasuada knew that she was playing an exceedingly dangerous game
with the most powerful madman in Alagaësia. If she misjudged how far she could push him, she and the
rest of the Varden would be destroyed, along with any hope of ending Galbatorix’s reign.
The clean smell of the castle reminded her of the times she had stayed there as a child, back when
Orrin’s father, King Larkin, still ruled. She never saw much of Orrin then. He was five years older than
her and al-ready occupied with his duties as a prince. Nowadays, though, she often felt as if she were the
elder one.
At the door to Orrin’s laboratory, she had to stop and wait for his bodyguards, who were always
posted outside, to announce her presence to the king. Soon Orrin’s voice boomed out into the stairwell:
“Lady Nasuada! I’m so glad you came. I have something to show you.”
Mentally bracing herself, she entered the laboratory with Farica. A maze of tables laden with a fantastic
array of alembics, beakers, and re-torts confronted them, like a glass thicket waiting to snag their dresses
on any one of its myriad fragile branches. The heavy odor of metallic vapors made Nasuada’s eyes
water. Lifting their hems off the floor, she and Farica wended their way in single file toward the back of
the room, past hourglasses and scales, arcane tomes bound with black iron, dwarven as-trolabes, and
piles of phosphorescent crystal prisms that produced fitful blue flashes.
They met Orrin by a marble-topped bench, where he stirred a crucible of quicksilver with a glass tube
that was closed at one end, open at the other, and must have measured at least three feet in length,
although it was only a quarter of an inch thick.
“Sire,” said Nasuada. As befitted one of equal rank to the king, she re-mained upright while Farica
curtsied. “You seem to have recovered from the explosion last week.”
Orrin grimaced good-naturedly. “I learned that it’s not wise to combine phosphorus and water in an
enclosed space. The result can be quite vio-lent.”

Page 502

“Has all of your hearing returned?”
“Not entirely, but...” Grinning like a boy with his first dagger, he lit a taper with the coals from a brazier,
which she could not fathom how he endured in the stifling weather, carried the flaming brand back to the
bench, and used it to start a pipe packed with cardus weed.
“I didn’t know that you smoked.”
“I don’t really,” he confessed, “except that I found that since my ear-drum hasn’t completely sealed up
yet, I can do this....” Drawing on the pipe, he puffed out his cheeks until a tendril of smoke issued from
his left ear, like a snake leaving its den, and coiled up the side of his head. It was so unexpected,
Nasuada burst out laughing, and after a moment, Orrin joined her, releasing a plume of smoke from his
mouth. “It’s the most peculiar sensation,” he confided. “Tickles like crazy on the way out.”
Growing serious again, Nasuada asked, “Was there something else that you wished to discuss with me,
Sire?”
He snapped his fingers. “Of course.” Dipping his long glass tube in the crucible, he filled it with
quicksilver, then capped the open end with one finger and showed the whole thing to her. “Would you
agree that the only thing in this tube is quicksilver?”
“I would.” Is this why he wanted to see me?
“And what about now?” With a quick movement, he inverted the tube and planted the open end inside
the crucible, removing his finger. Instead of all pouring out, as Nasuada expected, the quicksilver in the
tube dropped about halfway, then stopped and held its position. Orrin pointed to the empty section
above the suspended metal. He asked, “What occu-pies that space?”
“It must be air,” asserted Nasuada.
Orrin grinned and shook his head. “If that were true, how would the air bypass the quicksilver or diffuse
through the glass? No routes are avail-able by which the atmosphere can gain admission.” He gestured at
Farica. “What’s your opinion, maid?”
Farica stared at the tube, then shrugged and said, “It can’t be nothing, Sire.”
“Ah, but that’s exactly what I think it is: nothing. I believe that I’ve solved one of the oldest conundrums
of natural philosophy by creating and proving the existence of a vacuum! It completely invalidates
Va-cher’s theories and means that Ládin was actually a genius. Blasted elves always seem to be right.”
Nasuada struggled to remain cordial as she asked, “What purpose does it serve, though?”
“Purpose?” Orrin looked at her with genuine astonishment. “None, of course. At least not that I can
think of. However, this will help us to un-derstand the mechanics of our world, how and why things
happen. It’s a wondrous discovery. Who knows what else it might lead to?” While he spoke, he emptied
the tube and carefully placed it in a velvet-padded box that held similar delicate instruments. “The
prospect that truly ex-cites me, though, is of using magic to ferret out nature’s secrets. Why, just
yesterday, with a single spell, Trianna helped me to discover two en-tirely new gases. Imagine what could
be learned if magic were systemati-cally applied to the disciplines of natural philosophy. I’m considering
learning magic myself, if I have the talent for it, and if I can convince some magic users to divulge their
knowledge. It’s a pity that your Dragon Rider, Eragon, didn’t accompany you here; I’m sure that he

Page 503

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

could help me.”
Looking at Farica, Nasuada said, “Wait for me outside.” The woman curtsied and then departed. Once
Nasuada heard the door to the labora-tory close, she said, “Orrin. Have you taken leave of your
senses?”
“Whatever do you mean?”
“While you spend your time locked in here conducting experiments that no one
understands—endangering your well-being in the process— your country totters on the brink of war. A
myriad issues await your de-cision, and you stand here blowing smoke and playing with quicksilver?”
His face hardened. “I am quite aware of my duties, Nasuada. You may lead the Varden, but I’m still
king of Surda, and you would do well to re-call that before you speak so disrespectfully. Need I remind
you that your sanctuary here depends on my continued goodwill?”
She knew it was an idle threat; many of the Surdan people had relatives in the Varden, and vice versa.
They were too closely linked for either of them to abandon the other. No, the real reason that Orrin had
taken of-fense was the question of authority. Since it was nigh impossible to keep large groups of armed
warriors at the ready over extended periods of time—as Nasuada had learned, feeding that many
inactive people was a logistical nightmare—the Varden had begun taking jobs, starting farms, and
otherwise assimilating into their host country. Where will that leave me eventually? As the leader of a
nonexistent army? A general or councilor under Orrin? Her position was precarious. If she moved
too quickly or with too much initiative, Orrin would perceive it as a threat and turn against her, especially
now that she was cloaked in the glamour of the Varden’s victory in Farthen Dûr. But if she waited too
long, they would lose their chance to exploit Galbatorix’s momentary weakness. Her only advantage over
the maze of opposition was her command of the one element that had instigated this act of the play:
Eragon and Saphira.
She said, “I don’t seek to undermine your command, Orrin. That was never my intention, and I
apologize if it appeared that way.” He bowed his neck with a stiff bob. Unsure of how to continue, she
leaned on her fingertips against the lip of the bench. “It’s only... so many things must be done. I work
night and day—I keep a tablet beside my bed for notes— and yet I never catch up; I feel as if we are
always balanced on the brink of disaster.”
Orrin picked up a pestle stained black from use and rolled it between his palms with a steady, hypnotic
rhythm. “Before you came here... No, that’s not right. Before your Rider materialized fully formed from
the ethers like Moratensis from his fountain, I expected to live my life as my father and grandfather before
me. That is, opposing Galbatorix in secret. You must excuse me if it takes a while to accustom myself to
this new reality.”
It was as much contrition as she could expect in return. “I understand.”
He stopped the pestle in its path for a brief moment. “You are newly come to your power, whereas I
have held mine for a number of years. If I may be arrogant enough to offer advice, I’ve found that it’s
essential for my sanity to allocate a certain portion of the day for my own interests.”
“I couldn’t do that,” objected Nasuada. “Every moment I waste might be the moment of effort that’s
needed to defeat Galbatorix.”
The pestle paused again. “You do the Varden a disservice if you insist on overworking yourself. No one

Page 504

can function properly without occa-sional peace and quiet. They don’t have to be long breaks, just five
or ten minutes. You could even practice your archery, and then you would still serve your goals, albeit in
a different manner.... That’s why I had this labo-ratory constructed in the first place. That’s why I blow
smoke and play with quicksilver, as you put it—so that I don’t scream with frustration throughout the rest
of the day.”
Despite her reluctance to surrender her view of Orrin as a feckless lay-about, Nasuada could not help
but acknowledge the validity of his argu-ment. “I will keep your recommendation in mind.”
Some of his former levity returned as he smiled. “That’s all I ask.”
Walking to the window, she pushed the shutters farther open and gazed down upon Aberon, with its
cries of quick-fingered merchants hawking their wares to unsuspecting customers, the clotted yellow dust
blowing from the western road as a caravan approached the city gates, the air that shimmered over clay
tile roofs and carried the scent of cardus weed and incense from the marble temples, and the fields that
sur-rounded Aberon like the outstretched petals of a flower.
Without turning around, she asked, “Have you received copies of our latest reports from the Empire?”
“I have.” He joined her at the window.
“What’s your opinion of them?
“That they’re too meager and incomplete to extract any meaningful conclusions.”
“They’re the best we have, though. Give me your suspicions and your hunches. Extrapolate from the
known facts like you would if this were one of your experiments.” She smiled to herself. “I promise that I
won’t attach meaning to what you say.”
She had to wait for his reply, and when it came, it was with the dolor-ous weight of a doomsday
prophecy. “Increased taxes, emptied garrisons, horses and oxen confiscated throughout the Empire... It
seems that Gal-batorix gathers his forces in preparation to confront us, though I cannot tell whether he
means to do it in offense or defense.” Revolving shadows cooled their faces as a cloud of starlings
whirled across the sun. “The question that weighs upon my mind now is, how long will it take him to
mobilize? For that will determine the course of our strategies.”
“Weeks. Months. Years. I cannot predict his actions.”
He nodded. “Have your agents continued to spread tidings of Eragon?”
“It has become increasingly dangerous, but yes. My hope is that if we inundate cities like Dras-Leona
with rumors of Eragon’s prowess, when we actually reach the city and they see him, they will join us of
their own accord and we can avoid a siege.”
“War is rarely so easy.”
She let the comment pass uncontested. “And how fares the mobiliza-tion of your own army? The
Varden, as always, are ready to fight.”
Orrin spread his hands in a placating gesture. “It’s difficult to rouse a na-tion, Nasuada. There are nobles
who I must convince to back me, armor and weapons to be constructed, supplies to be gathered....”

Page 505

“And in the meantime, how do I feed my people? We need more land than you allotted us—”
“Well, I know it,” he said.
“—and we’ll only get it by invading the Empire, unless you fancy mak-ing the Varden a permanent
addition to Surda. If so, you’ll have to find homes for the thousands of people I brought from Farthen
Dûr, which won’t please your existing citizens. Whatever your choice, choose quickly, because I fear that
if you continue to procrastinate, the Varden will disintegrate into an uncontrollable horde.” She tried not
to make it sound like a threat.
Nevertheless, Orrin obviously did not appreciate the insinuation. His upper lip curled and he said, “Your
father never let his men get out of hand. I trust you won’t either, if you expect to remain leader of the
Varden. As for our preparations, there’s a limit to what we can do in so short a time; you’ll just have to
wait until we are ready.”
She gripped the windowsill until veins stood out on her wrists and her fingernails sank into the crevices
between the stones, yet she allowed none of her anger to color her voice: “In that case, will you lend the
Varden more gold for food?”
“No. I’ve given you all the money I can spare.”
“How will we eat, then?”
“I would suggest that you raise the funds yourself.”
Furious, she gave him her widest, brightest smile—holding it long enough to make him shift with
unease—and then curtsied as deeply as a servant, never letting her demented grimace waver. “Farewell
then, Sire. I hope that the rest of your day is as enjoyable as our conversation was.”
Orrin muttered an unintelligible response as she swept back to the laboratory’s entrance. In her anger,
Nasuada caught her right sleeve on a jade bottle and knocked it over, cracking the stone and releasing a
flood of yellow liquid that splattered her sleeve and soaked her skirt. She flicked her wrist in annoyance
without stopping.
Farica rejoined her in the stairwell, and together they traversed the warren of passageways to Nasuada’s
chambers.
HANGING BY A THREAD

Throwing open the doors to her rooms, Nasuada strode to her desk, then dropped into a chair, blind to
her surroundings. Her spine was so rigid that her shoulders did not touch the back. She felt frozen by the
in-soluble quandary the Varden faced. The rise and fall of her chest slowed until it was imperceptible. I
have failed, was all she could think.
“Ma’am, your sleeve!”
Jolted from her reverie, Nasuada looked down to find Farica beating at her right arm with a cleaning rag.
A wisp of smoke rose from the em-broidered sleeve. Alarmed, Nasuada pushed herself out of the chair

and twisted her arm, trying to find the cause of the smoke. Her sleeve and skirt were disintegrating into
chalky cobwebs that emitted acrid fumes.
“Get me out of this,” she said.
She held her contaminated arm away from her body and forced herself to remain still as Farica unlaced
her overgown. The handmaid’s fingers scrabbled against Nasuada’s back with frantic haste, fumbling
with the knots, and then finally loosening the wool shell that encased Nasuada’s torso. As soon as the
overgown sagged, Nasuada yanked her arms out of the sleeves and clawed her way free of the robe.
Panting, she stood by the desk, clad only in her slippers and linen che-mise. To her relief, the expensive
chainsil had escaped harm, although it had acquired a foul reek.
“Did it burn you?” asked Farica. Nasuada shook her head, not trusting her tongue to respond. Farica
nudged the overgown with the tip of her shoe. “What evil is this?”
“One of Orrin’s foul concoctions,” croaked Nasuada. “I spilled it in his laboratory.” Calming herself with
long breaths, she examined the ruined gown with dismay. It had been woven by the dwarf women of
Dûrgrimst Ingeitum as a gift for her last birthday and was one of the finest pieces in her wardrobe. She
had nothing to replace it, nor could she justify com-missioning a new dress, considering the Varden’s
financial difficulties. Somehow I will have to make do without.
Farica shook her head. “It’s a shame to lose such a pretty dress.” She went round the desk to a sewing
basket and returned with a pair of etched scissors. “We might as well save as much of the cloth as we
can. I’ll cut off the ruined parts and have them burned.”
Nasuada scowled and paced the length of the room, seething with an-ger at her own clumsiness and at
having another problem added to her already overwhelming list of worries. “What am I going to wear to
court now?” she demanded.
The scissors bit into the soft wool with brisk authority. “Mayhap your linen dress.”
“It’s too casual to appear in before Orrin and his nobles.”
“Give me a chance with it, Ma’am. I’m sure that I can alter it so it’s ser-viceable. By the time I’m done,
it’ll look twice as grand as this one ever did.”
“No, no. It won’t work. They’ll just laugh at me. It’s hard enough to command their respect when I’m
dressed properly, much less if I’m wearing patched gowns that advertise our poverty.”
The older woman fixed Nasuada with a stern gaze. “It will work, so long as you don’t apologize for
your appearance. Not only that, I guaran-tee that the other ladies will be so taken with your new fashion
that they’ll imitate you. Just you wait and see.” Going to the door, she cracked it open and handed the
damaged fabric to one of the guards outside. “Your mistress wants this burned. Do it in secret and
breathe not a word of this to another soul or you’ll have me to answer to.” The guard saluted.
Nasuada could not help smiling. “How would I function without you, Farica?”
“Quite well, I should think.”
After donning her green hunting frock—which, with its light skirt, provided some respite from the day’s

Page 507

heat—Nasuada decided that even though she was ill disposed toward Orrin, she would take his advice
and break with her regular schedule to do nothing more important than help Farica rip out stitches from
the overgown. She found the repetitive task an excellent way to focus her thoughts. While she pulled on
the threads, she discussed the Varden’s predicament with Farica, in the hope that she might perceive a
solution that had escaped Nasuada.
In the end, Farica’s only assistance was to observe, “Seems most matters in this world have their root in
gold. If we had enough of it, we could buy Galbatorix right off his black throne... might not even have to
fight his men.”
Did I really expect that someone else would do my job for me?Nasuada asked herself. I led us into this
blind and I have to lead us out.
Intending to cut open a seam, she extended her arm and snagged the tip of her knife on a fringe of
bobbin lace, slicing it in half. She stared at the ragged wound in the lace, at the frayed ends of the
parchment-colored strands that wriggled across the overgown like so many contorted worms, stared and
felt a hysterical laugh claw at her throat even as a tear formed in her eye. Could her luck be any worse?
The bobbin lace was the most valuable part of the dress. Even though lace required skill to make, its
rarity and expense were mainly due to its central ingredient: vast, copious, mind-numbing, and deadening
amounts of time. It took so long to produce that if you attempted to create a lace veil by yourself, your
progress would be measured not in weeks but in months. Ounce for ounce, lace was worth more than
gold or silver.
She ran her fingers over the band of threads, pausing on the rift that she had created. It’s not as if lace
takes that much energy, just time. She hated making it herself. Energy... energy... At that moment, a
series of images flashed through her mind: Orrin talking about using magic for research; Trianna, the
woman who had helmed Du Vrangr Gata since the Twins’ deaths; looking up at one of the Varden’s
healers while he explained the principles of magic to Nasuada when she was only five or six years old.
The disparate experiences formed a chain of reasoning that was so outra-geous and unlikely, it finally
released the laugh imprisoned in her throat.
Farica gave her an odd look and waited for an explanation. Standing, Nasuada tumbled half the
overgown off her lap and onto the floor. “Fetch me Trianna this instant,” she said. “I don’t care what
she’s doing; bring her here.”
The skin around Farica’s eyes tightened, but she curtsied and said, “As you wish, Ma’am.” She
departed through the hidden servants’ door.
“Thank you,” Nasuada whispered in the empty room.
She understood her maid’s reluctance; she too felt uncomfortable whenever she had to interact with
magic users. Indeed, she only trusted Eragon because he was a Rider—although that was no proof of
virtue, as Galbatorix had shown—and because of his oath of fealty, which Nasuada knew he would
never break. It scared her to consider magicians’ and sor-cerers’ powers. The thought that a seemingly
ordinary person could kill with a word; invade your mind if he or she wished; cheat, lie, and steal without
being caught; and otherwise defy society with near impunity...
Her heart quickened.
How did you enforce the law when a certain segment of the popula-tion possessed special powers? At

Page 508

its most basic level, the Varden’s war against the Empire was nothing more than an attempt to bring to
justice a man who had abused his magical abilities and to prevent him from committing further crimes. All
this pain and destruction because no one had the strength to defeat Galbatorix. He won’t even die
after a normal span of years!
Although she disliked magic, she knew that it would play a crucial role in removing Galbatorix and that
she could not afford to alienate its prac-titioners until victory was assured. Once that occurred, she
intended to resolve the problem that they presented.
A brazen knock on her chamber door disturbed her thoughts. Fixing a pleasant smile on her face and
guarding her mind as she had been trained, Nasuada said, “Enter!” It was important that she appear
polite after sum-moning Trianna in such a rude manner.
The door thrust open and the brunette sorceress strode into the room, her tousled locks piled high above
her head with obvious haste. She looked as if she had just been roused from bed. Bowing in the dwarven
fashion, she said, “You asked for me, Lady?”
“I did.” Relaxing into a chair, Nasuada let her gaze slowly drift up and down Trianna. The sorceress
lifted her chin under Nasuada’s examina-tion. “I need to know: What is the most important rule of
magic?”
Trianna frowned. “That whatever you do with magic requires the same amount of energy as it would to
do otherwise.”
“And what you can do is only limited by your ingenuity and by your knowledge of the ancient
language?”
“Other strictures apply, but in general, yes. Lady, why do you ask? These are basic principles of magic
that, while not commonly bandied about, I am sure you are familiar with.”
“I am. I wished to ensure that I understood them properly.” Without moving from her chair, Nasuada
reached down and lifted the overgown so that Trianna could see the mutilated lace. “So then, within
those lim-its, you should be able to devise a spell that will allow you to manufac-ture lace with magic.”
A condescending sneer distorted the sorceress’s dark lips. “Du Vrangr Gata has more important duties
than repairing your clothes, Lady. Our art is not so common as to be employed for mere whims. I’m sure
that you will find your seamstresses and tailors more than capable of fulfilling your request. Now, if you
will excuse me, I—”
“Be quiet, woman,” said Nasuada in a flat voice. Astonishment muted Trianna in midsentence. “I see that
I must teach Du Vrangr Gata the same lesson that I taught the Council of Elders: I may be young, but I
am no child to be patronized. I ask about lace because if you can manufac-ture it quickly and easily with
magic, then we can support the Varden by selling inexpensive bobbin and needle lace throughout the
Empire. Gal-batorix’s own people will provide the funds we need to survive.”
“But that’s ridiculous,” protested Trianna. Even Farica looked skeptical. “You can’t pay for a war with
lace. ”
Nasuada raised an eyebrow. “Why not? Women who otherwise could never afford to own lace will leap
at the chance to buy ours. Every farmer’s wife who longs to appear richer than she is will want it. Even
wealthy merchants and nobles will give us their gold because our lace will be finer than any thrown or

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

stitched by human hands. We’ll garner a fortune to rival the dwarves’. That is, if you are skilled enough in
magic to do what I want.”
Trianna tossed her hair. “You doubt my abilities?”
“Can it be done!”
Trianna hesitated, then took the overgown from Nasuada and studied the lace strip for a long while. At
last she said, “It should be possible, but I’ll have to conduct some tests before I know for certain.”
“Do so immediately. From now on, this is your most important assign-ment. And find an experienced
lace maker to advise you on the patterns.”
“Yes, Lady Nasuada.”
Nasuada allowed her voice to soften. “Good. I also want you to select the brightest members of Du
Vrangr Gata and work with them to invent other magical techniques that will help the Varden. That’s
your responsi-bility, not mine.”
“Yes, Lady Nasuada.”
“ Nowyou are excused. Report back to me tomorrow morning.”
“Yes, Lady Nasuada.”
Satisfied, Nasuada watched the sorceress depart, then closed her eyes and allowed herself to enjoy a
moment of pride for what she had accom-plished. She knew that no man, not even her father, would
have thought of her solution. “This is my contribution to the Varden,” she told herself, wishing that Ajihad
could witness it. Louder, she asked, “Did I surprise you, Farica?”
“You always do, Ma’am.”
ELVA

“Ma’am?... You’re needed, Ma’am.”
“What?” Reluctant to move, Nasuada opened her eyes and saw Jör-mundur enter the room. The wiry
veteran pulled off his helm, tucked it in the crook of his right arm, and made his way to her with his left
hand planted on the pommel of his sword.
The links of his hauberk clinked as he bowed. “My Lady.”
“Welcome, Jörmundur. How is your son today?” She was pleased that he had come. Of all the
members of the Council of Elders, he had ac-cepted her leadership the most easily, serving her with the
same dogged loyalty and determination as he had Ajihad. If all my warriors were like him, no one
could stop us.
“His cough has subsided.”

Page 510

“I’m glad to hear it. Now, what brings you?”
Lines appeared on Jörmundur’s forehead. He ran his free hand over his hair, which was tied back in a
ponytail, then caught himself and pushed his hand back down to his side. “Magic, of the strangest kind.”
“Oh?”
“Do you remember the babe that Eragon blessed?”
“Aye.” Nasuada had seen her only once, but she was well aware of the exaggerated tales about the child
that circulated among the Varden, as well as the Varden’s hopes for what the girl might achieve once she
grew up. Nasuada was more pragmatic about the subject. Whatever the infant became, it would not be
for many years, by which time the battle with Galbatorix would already be won or lost.
“I’ve been asked to take you to her.”
“Asked? By whom? And why?”
“A boy on the practice field told me that you should visit the child. Said that you would find it interesting.
He refused to give me his name, but he looked like what that witch’s werecat is supposed to turn into, so
I thought... Well, I thought you should know.” Jörmundur looked embar-rassed. “I asked my men
questions about the girl, and I heard things... that she’s different. ”
“In what way?”
He shrugged. “Enough to believe that you should do what the werecat says.”
Nasuada frowned. She knew from the old stories that ignoring a were-cat was the height of folly and
often led to one’s doom. However, his companion—Angela the herbalist—was another magic user that
Nasuada did not entirely trust; she was too independent and unpredictable. “Magic,” she said, making it
a curse.
“Magic,” agreed Jörmundur, though he used it as a word of awe and fear.
“Very well, let us go visit this child. Is she within the castle?”
“Orrin gave her and her caretaker rooms on the west side of the keep.”
“Take me to her.”
Gathering up her skirts, Nasuada ordered Farica to postpone the rest of the day’s appointments, then
left the chambers. Behind her, she heard Jörmundur snap his fingers as he directed four guards to take up
positions around her. A moment later, he joined her side, pointing out their course.
The heat within Borromeo Castle had increased to the point where they felt as if they were trapped
within a giant bread oven. The air shimmered like liquid glass along the windowsills.
Though she was uncomfortable, Nasuada knew that she dealt with the heat better than most people
because of her swarthy skin. The ones who had the hardest time enduring the high temperatures were
men like Jör-mundur and her guards, who had to wear their armor all day long, even if they were
stationed out under the lidless gaze of the sun.

Page 511

Nasuada kept close watch on the five men as sweat gathered on their exposed skin and their breathing
became ever more ragged. Since they had arrived in Aberon, a number of the Varden had fainted from
heat-stroke—two of whom died an hour or two later—and she had no inten-tion of losing more of her
subjects by driving them beyond their physical limits.
When she deemed they needed to rest, she bade them to stop— overriding their objections—and get
drinks of water from a servant. “I can’t have you toppling like ninepins.”
They had to break twice more before they reached their destination, a nondescript door recessed in the
inner wall of the corridor. The floor around it was littered with gifts.
Jörmundur knocked, and a quavering voice from inside asked, “Who is it?”
“Lady Nasuada, come to see the child,” he said.
“Be you of true heart and steadfast resolve?”
This time Nasuada answered, “My heart is pure and my resolve is as iron.”
“Cross the threshold, then, and be welcome.”
The door swung open to an entryway lit by a single red dwarf lantern. No one was at the door.
Proceeding inward, Nasuada saw that the walls and ceiling were swathed with layers of dark fabric,
giving the place the appearance of a cave or lair. To her surprise, the air was quite cold, al-most chilly,
like a brisk autumn night. Apprehension sank its poisonous claws into her belly. Magic.
A black mesh curtain blocked her way. Brushing it aside, she found herself in what was once a sitting
room. The furniture had been removed, except for a line of chairs pushed against the shrouded walls. A
cluster of faint dwarf lanterns were hung in a dimple of the sagging fabric overhead, casting weird
multicolored shadows in every direction.
A bent crone watched her from the depths of one corner, bracketed by Angela the herbalist and the
werecat, who stood with his hackles raised. In the center of the room knelt a pale girl that Nasuada took
to be three or four years old. The girl picked at a platter of food on her lap. No one spoke.
Confused, Nasuada asked, “Where is the baby?”
The girl looked up.
Nasuada gasped as she saw the dragon mark bright upon the child’s brow and as she peered deep into
her violet eyes. The girl quirked her lips with a terrible, knowing smile. “I am Elva.”
Nasuada recoiled without thinking, clutching at the dagger she kept strapped to her left forearm. It was
an adult’s voice and filled with an adult’s experience and cynicism. It sounded profane coming from the
mouth of a child.
“Don’t run,” said Elva. “I’m your friend.” She put the platter aside; it was empty now. To the crone, she
said, “More food.” The old woman hurried from the room. Then Elva patted the floor beside her.
“Please, sit. I have been waiting for you ever since I learned to talk.”

Page 512

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Keeping her grip on her dagger, Nasuada lowered herself to the stones. “When was that?”
“Last week.” Elva folded her hands in her lap. She fixed her ghastly eyes on Nasuada, pinning her in
place through the unnatural strength of her gaze. Nasuada felt as if a violet lance had pierced her skull and
was twist-ing inside her mind, tearing apart her thoughts and memories. She fought the desire to scream.
Leaning forward, Elva reached out and cupped Nasuada’s cheek with one soft hand. “You know,
Ajihad could not have led the Varden better than you have. You chose the correct path. Your name will
be praised for centuries for having the courage and foresight to move the Varden to Surda and attack the
Empire when everyone else thought it was insane to do so.”
Nasuada gaped at the girl, stunned. Like a key matched to a lock, Elva’s words perfectly addressed
Nasuada’s primal fears, the doubts that kept her awake at night, sweating in the darkness. An involuntary
surge of emotion rushed through her, bolstering her with a sense of confidence and peace that she had
not possessed since before Ajihad’s death. Tears of relief burst from her eyes and rolled down her face.
It was as if Elva had known exactly what to say in order to comfort her.
Nasuada loathed her for it.
Her euphoria warred against her distaste for how this moment of weakness had been induced and by
whom. Nor did she trust the girl’s motivation.
“What are you?” she demanded.
“I am what Eragon made me.”
“He blessed you.”
The dreadful, ancient eyes were obscured for a moment as Elva blinked. “He did not understand his
actions. Since Eragon ensorcelled me, whenever I see a person, I sense all the hurts that beset him and
are about to beset him. When I was smaller, I could do nothing about it. So I grew bigger.”
“Why would—”
“The magic in my blood drives me to protect people from pain... no matter the injury to myself or
whether I want to help or not.” Her smile acquired a bitter twist. “It costs me dearly if I resist the urge.”
As Nasuada digested the implications, she realized that Elva’s unsettling aspect was a by-product of the
suffering that she had been exposed to. Nasuada shivered at the thought of what the girl had endured. It
must have torn her apart to have this compulsion and yet be unable to act on it. Against her better
judgment, she began to feel a measure of sympathy for Elva.
“Why have you told me this?”
“I thought that you should know who and what I am.” Elva paused, and the fire in her gaze strengthened.
“And that I will fight for you however I can. Use me as you would an assassin—in hiding, in the dark,
and with-out mercy.” She laughed with a high, chilling voice. “You wonder why; I see you do. Because
unless this war ends, and sooner rather than later, it will drive me insane. I find it hard enough to deal with
the agonies of everyday life without also having to confront the atrocities of battle. Use me to end it and
I’ll ensure that your life is as happy as any human has had the privilege to experience.”

Page 513

At that moment, the crone scurried back into the room, bowed to Elva, and handed her a new platter of
food. It was a physical relief to Nasuada as Elva looked down and attacked a leg of mutton, cramming
the meat into her mouth with both hands. She ate with the ravenous in-tensity of a gorging wolf,
displaying a complete lack of decorum. With her violet eyes hidden and her dragon mark covered by
black bangs, she once again appeared to be nothing more than an innocent child.
Nasuada waited until it became apparent that Elva had said all she was going to. Then—at a gesture
from Angela—she accompanied the herbal-ist through a side door, leaving the pale girl sitting alone in the
center of the dark, cloth-bound room, like a dire fetus nestled in its womb, waiting for the right moment
to emerge.
Angela made sure that the door was closed and whispered, “All she does is eat and eat. We can’t sate
her appetite with the current rations. Can you—”
“She’ll be fed. You needn’t worry about it.” Nasuada rubbed her arms, trying to eradicate the memory
of those awful, horrible eyes....
“Thank you.”
“Has this ever happened to anyone else?”
Angela shook her head until her curly hair bounced on her shoulders. “Not in the entire history of magic.
I tried to cast her future, but it’s a hopeless quagmire—lovely word, quagmire —because her life
interacts with so many others.”
“Is she dangerous?”
“We’re all dangerous.”
“You know what I mean.”
Angela shrugged. “She’s more dangerous than some and less than others. The one she’s most likely to
kill, though, is herself. If she meets someone who’s about to be hurt and Eragon’s spell catches her
unawares, then she’ll take the doomed person’s place. That’s why she stays inside most of the time.”
“How far in advance can she foretell events?”
“Two or three hours at the most.”
Leaning against the wall, Nasuada considered the newest complication in her life. Elva could be a potent
weapon if she were applied correctly. Through her, I can discern my opponents’ troubles and
weaknesses, as well as what will please them and make them amenable to my wishes. In an
emergency, the girl could also act as an infallible guard if one of the Varden, like Eragon or Saphira, had
to be protected.
She can’t be left unsupervised. I need someone to watch her. Someone who understands magic and is
comfortable enough with their own identity to re-sist Elva’s influence... and who I can trust to be reliable
and honest.She immediately discounted Trianna.
Nasuada looked at Angela. Though she was wary of the herbalist, she knew that Angela had helped the
Varden with matters of the utmost delicacy and importance—like healing Eragon—and had asked for

Page 514

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

noth-ing in return. Nasuada could think of no one else who had the time, in-clination, and expertise to
look after Elva.
“I realize,” said Nasuada, “that this is presumptuous of me, as you aren’t under my command and I
know little of your life or duties, but I have a favor to ask of you.”
“Proceed.” Angela waved a hand.
Nasuada faltered, disconcerted, then forged ahead. “Would you be will-ing to keep an eye on Elva for
me? I need—”
“Of course! And I’ll keep two eyes on her, if I can spare them. I relish the opportunity to study her.”
“You’ll have to report to me,” warned Nasuada.
“The poison dart hidden in the raisin tart. Ah, well, I suppose I can manage.”
“I have your word, then?”
“You have my word.”
Relieved, Nasuada groaned and sank into a nearby chair. “Oh, what a mess. What a quagmire. As
Eragon’s liegelord, I’m responsible for his deeds, but I never imagined that he would do anything as
dreadful as this. It’s a blight on my honor as much as his.”
A ripple of sharp pops filled the room as Angela cracked her knuckles. “Yes. I intend to speak to him
about it once he returns from Ellesméra.”
Her expression was so fierce, it alarmed Nasuada. “Well, don’t hurt him. We need him.” “I won’t...
permanently.”
RESURGENCE

A blast of ravening wind tore Eragon from his sleep.
Blankets flapped over him as a tempest clawed at his room, hurling his possessions into the air and
knocking the lanterns against the walls. Out-side, the sky was black with thunderheads.
Saphira watched as Eragon staggered upright and fought to keep his balance as the tree swayed like a
ship at sea. He lowered his head against the gale and made his way around the room, clutching at the wall
until he reached the teardrop portal through which the storm howled.
Eragon looked past the heaving floor to the ground below. It appeared to rock back and forth. He
swallowed and tried to ignore the churning in his stomach.
By touch he found the edge of the cloth membrane that could be pulled out of the wood to cover the
opening. He prepared to launch himself from one side of the gap to the next. If he slipped, nothing would
stop him from falling onto the roots of the tree.

Page 515

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Wait,said Saphira.
She backed off the low pedestal where she slept and laid her tail along-side him so that he could use it
as a handrail.
Holding the cloth with just his right hand, which took all his strength, Eragon used the line of spikes on
Saphira’s tail to pull himself across the portal. As soon as he reached the far side, he grabbed the cloth
with both hands and pressed its edge into the groove that locked it in place.
The room went silent.
The membrane bulged inward under the force of the angry elements but showed no sign of giving.
Eragon poked it with his finger. The fabric was as taut as a drum.
It’s amazing what the elves can do,he said.
Saphira cocked her head, then lifted it so that her head was flat against the ceiling while she listened.
You’d better close up the study; it’s being wrecked.
As he headed toward the stairs, the tree jolted and his leg buckled, sending him down hard on one knee.
“Blast it,” he growled.
The study was a whirlwind of paper and quills, darting about as if they had a mind of their own. He dove
into the flurry with his arms wrapped around his head. It felt like he was being pelted with stones when
the tips of the quills struck him.
Eragon struggled to close the upper portal without Saphira’s help. The moment he did, pain—endless,
mind-numbing pain— ripped open his back.
He screamed once and went hoarse from the strength of his cry. His vi-sion flashed with red and yellow,
then faded to black as he toppled to his side. Below, he heard Saphira howl with frustration; the staircase
was too small and, outside, the wind was too ferocious for her to reach him. His connection with her
receded. He surrendered to the waiting darkness as a release from his agony.
A sour taste filled Eragon’s mouth when he woke. He did not know how long he had been lying on the
floor, but the muscles in his arms and legs were knotted from being curled into a tight ball. The storm still
as-sailed the tree, accompanied by a thudding rain that matched the pound-ing in his head.
Saphira... ?
I’m here. Can you come down?
I’ll try.
He was too weak to stand on the pitching floor, so he crawled to the stairs and slid down one at a time,
wincing with each impact. Halfway down, he encountered Saphira, who had jammed her head and neck
as far up the stairs as she could, gouging the wood in her frenzy.
Little one.She flicked out her tongue and caught him on the hand with its rough tip. He smiled. Then she
arched her neck and tried to pull back, but to no avail.

Page 516

What’s wrong?
I’m stuck.
You’re...He could not help it; he laughed even though it hurt. The situation was too absurd.
She snarled and heaved her entire body, shaking the tree with her ef-forts and knocking him over. Then
she collapsed, panting. Well, don’t just sit there grinning like an idiot fox. Help me!
Fighting the urge to giggle, he put his foot on her nose and pushed as hard as he dared while Saphira
twisted and squirmed in an attempt to free herself.
It took more than ten minutes before she succeeded. Only then did Er-agon see the full extent of the
damage to the stairwell. He groaned. Her scales had cut through the bark and obliterated the delicate
patterns grown out from the wood.
Oops,said Saphira.
At leastyou did it, not me . The elves might forgiveyou. They’d sing dwarf love ballads night and
day if you asked them to.
He joined Saphira on her dais and huddled against the flat scales of her belly, listening as the storm
roared about them. The wide membrane be-came translucent whenever lightning pulsed in jagged shards
of light.
What time do you think it is?
Several hours before we must meet Oromis. Go on, sleep and recover. I will keep guard.
He did just that, despite the tree’s churning.
WHY DO YOU FIGHT?

Oromis’s timepiece buzzed like a giant hornet, blaring in Eragon’s ears until he retrieved the bauble and
wound the mechanism.
His bashed knee had turned purple, he was sore both from his attack and the elves’ Dance of Snake
and Crane, and he could do no more than croak with his ragged throat. The worst injury, though, was his
sense of foreboding that this would not be the last time Durza’s wound would trouble him. The prospect
sickened him, draining his strength and will.
So many weeks passed between attacks,he said, I began to hope that maybe, just maybe, I was
healed.... I suppose sheer luck is the only reason I was spared that long.
Extending her neck, Saphira nuzzled him on the arm. You know you aren’t alone, little one. I’ll do
everything I can to help. He responded with a weak smile. Then she licked his face and added, You
should get ready to leave.

I know.He stared at the floor, unwilling to move, then dragged himself to the wash closet, where he
scrubbed himself clean and used magic to shave.
He was in the middle of drying himself when he felt a presence touch his mind. Without pausing to think,
Eragon began to fortify his mind, concentrating on an image of his big toe to the exclusion of all else. Then
he heard Oromis say, Admirable, but unnecessary. Bring Zar’roc with you today . The presence
vanished.
Eragon released a shaky breath. I need to be more alert, he told Saphira. I would have been at his
mercy if he were an enemy.
Not with me around.
When his ablutions were complete, Eragon unhooked the membrane from the wall and mounted
Saphira, cradling Zar’roc in the crook of his arm.
Saphira took flight with a rush of air, angling toward the Crags of Tel’naeír. From their high vantage
point, they could see the damage that the storm had wreaked on Du Weldenvarden. No trees had fallen
in Ellesméra, but farther away, where the elves’ magic was weaker, numerous pines had been knocked
over. The remaining wind made the crossed branches and trees rub together, producing a brittle chorus
of creaks and groans. Clouds of golden pollen, as thick as dust, streamed out from the trees and flowers.
While they flew, Eragon and Saphira exchanged memories of their separate lessons from the day before.
He told her what he had learned about ants and the ancient language, and she told him about downdrafts
and other dangerous weather patterns and how to avoid them.
Thus, when they landed and Oromis interrogated Eragon about Saphira’s lessons and Glaedr
interrogated Saphira about Eragon’s, they were able to answer every question.
“Very good, Eragon-vodhr.”
Aye. Well played, Bjartskular,added Glaedr to Saphira.
As before, Saphira was sent off with Glaedr while Eragon remained on the cliffs, although this time he
and Saphira were careful to maintain their link so as to absorb each other’s instruction.
As the dragons departed, Oromis observed, “Your voice is rougher to-day, Eragon. Are you sick?”
“My back hurt again this morning.”
“Ah. You have my sympathy.” He motioned with one finger. “Wait here.”
Eragon watched as Oromis strode into his hut and then reappeared, looking fierce and warlike with his
silver mane rippling in the wind and his bronze sword in hand. “Today,” he said, “we shall forgo the
Rimgar and instead cross our two blades, Naegling and Zar’roc. Draw thy sword and guard its edge as
your first master taught you.”
Eragon wanted nothing more than to refuse. However, he had no inten-tion of breaking his vow or letting
his resolve waver in front of Oromis. He swallowed his trepidation. This is what it means to be a Rider,
he thought.

Drawing upon his reserves, he located the nub deep within his mind that connected him to the wild flow
of magic. He delved into it, and the energy suffused him. “Gëuloth du knífr,” he said, and a winking blue
star popped into existence between his thumb and forefinger, jumping from one to the next as he ran it
down Zar’roc’s perilous length.
The instant their swords met, Eragon knew that he was as out-matched by Oromis as by Durza and
Arya. Eragon was an exemplary human swordsman, but he could not compete with warriors whose
blood ran thick with magic. His arm was too weak and his reflexes too slow. Still, that did not stop him
from trying to win. He fought to the limits of his abilities, even if, in the end, it was a futile prospect.
Oromis tested him in every conceivable manner, forcing Eragon to util-ize his entire arsenal of blows,
counterblows, and underhand tricks. It was all for naught. He could not touch the elf. As a last resort, he
tried alter-ing his style of fighting, which could unsettle even the most hardened veteran. All it got him was
a welt on his thigh.
“Move your feet faster,” cried Oromis. “He who stands like a pillar dies in battle. He who bends like a
reed is triumphant!”
The elf was glorious in action, a perfect blend of control and untamed violence. He pounced like a cat,
struck like a heron, and bobbed and wove with the grace of a weasel.
They had been sparring for almost twenty minutes when Oromis fal-tered, his narrow features clamped
in a brief grimace. Eragon recognized the symptoms of Oromis’s mysterious illness and lashed out with
Zar’roc. It was a low thing to do, but Eragon was so frustrated, he was willing to take advantage of any
opening, no matter how unfair, just to have the sat-isfaction of marking Oromis at least once.
Zar’roc never reached its target. As Eragon twisted, he overextended and strained his back.
The pain was upon him without warning.
The last thing he heard was Saphira shouting, Eragon!
Despite the intensity of the fit, Eragon remained conscious throughout his ordeal. Not that he was aware
of his surroundings, only the fire that burned in his flesh and prolonged each second into an eternity. The
worst part was that he could do nothing to end his suffering but wait... and wait...
Eragon lay panting in the cold mud. He blinked as his vision came into focus and he saw Oromis sitting
on a stool next to him. Pushing himself onto his knees, Eragon surveyed his new tunic with a mixture of
regret and disgust. The fine russet cloth was caked with dirt from his convul-sions on the ground. Muck
filled his hair as well.
He could sense Saphira in his mind, radiating concern as she waited for him to notice her. How can you
continue like this? she fretted. It’ll destroy you.
Her misgivings undermined Eragon’s remaining fortitude. Saphira had never before expressed doubt that
he would prevail, not at Dras-Leona, Gil’ead, or Farthen Dûr, nor with any of the dangers they had
encoun-tered. Her confidence had given him courage. Without it he was truly afraid.
You should concentrate on your lesson,he said.
I should concentrate on you.

Leave me alone!He snapped at her like a wounded animal that wants to nurse its injuries in silence and in
dark. She fell silent, leaving just enough of their connection intact so that he was vaguely aware of Glaedr
teaching her about fireweed, which she could chew to help her digestion.
Eragon combed the mud from his hair with his fingers, then spat out a globule of blood. “Bit my tongue.”
Oromis nodded as if it were to be expected. “Do you require healing?”
“No.”
“Very well. Tend to your sword, then bathe and go to the stump in the glade and listen to the thoughts of
the forest. Listen, and when you hear no more, come tell me what you have learned.”
“Yes, Master.”
As he sat on the stump, Eragon found that his turbulent thoughts and emotions prevented him from
mustering the concentration to open his mind and sense the creatures in the hollow. Nor was he
interested in doing so.
Still, the peaceful quality of his surroundings gradually ameliorated his resentment, confusion, and
stubborn anger. It did not make him happy, but it did bring him a certain fatalistic acceptance. This is my
lot in life, and I’d better get used to it because it’s not about to improve in the foresee-able future.
After a quarter of an hour, his faculties had regained their usual acuity, so he resumed studying the
colony of red ants that he had discovered the day before. He also tried to be aware of everything else
that was happen-ing in the glade, as Oromis had instructed.
Eragon met with limited success. If he relaxed and allowed himself to absorb input from all the
consciousnesses nearby, thousands of images and feelings rushed into his head, piling on top of one
another in quick flashes of sound and color, touch and smell, pain and pleasure. The amount of
information was overwhelming. Out of pure habit, his mind would snatch one subject or another from the
torrent, excluding all the rest before he noticed his lapse and wrenched himself back into a state of
passive receptivity. The cycle repeated itself every few seconds.
Despite that, he was able to improve his understanding of the ants’ world. He got his first clue as to their
genders when he deduced that the huge ant in the heart of their underground lair was laying eggs, one
every minute or so, which made it—her—a female. And when he accompanied a group of the red ants
up the stem of their rosebush, he got a vivid demonstration of the kind of enemies they faced: some thing
darted out from underneath a leaf and killed one of the ants he was bound to. It was hard for him to
guess exactly what the creature was, since the ants only saw fragments of it and, in any case, they placed
more emphasis on smell than vision. If they had been people, he would have said that they were attacked
by a terrifying monster the size of a dragon, which had jaws as powerful as the spiked portcullis at Teirm
and could move with whip-lash speed.
The ants ringed in the monster like grooms working to capture a run-away horse. They darted at it with
a total lack of fear, nipping at its knobbed legs and withdrawing an instant before they were caught in the
monster’s iron pincers. More and more ants joined the throng. They worked together to overpower the
intruder, never faltering, even when two were caught and killed and when several of their brethren fell off
the stem to the ground below.

It was a desperate battle, with neither side willing to give quarter. Only escape or victory would save the
combatants from a horrible death. Er-agon followed the fray with breathless anticipation, awed by the
ants’ bravery and how they continued to fight in spite of injuries that would incapacitate a human. Their
feats were heroic enough to be sung about by bards throughout the land.
Eragon was so engrossed by the contest that when the ants finally pre-vailed, he loosed an elated cry so
loud, it roused the birds from their roosts among the trees.
Out of curiosity, he returned his attention to his own body, then walked to the rosebush to view the dead
monster for himself. What he saw was an ordinary brown spider with its legs curled into a fist being
transported by the ants down to their nest for food.
Amazing.
He started to leave, but then realized that once again he had neglected to keep watch over the myriad
other insects and animals in the glade. He closed his eyes and whirled through the minds of several dozen
beings, doing his best to memorize as many interesting details as he could. It was a poor substitute for
prolonged observation, but he was hungry and he had already exhausted his assigned hour.
When Eragon rejoined Oromis in his hut, the elf asked, “How went it?”
“Master, I could listen night and day for the next twenty years and still not know everything that goes on
in the forest.”
Oromis raised an eyebrow. “You have made progress.” After Eragon de-scribed what he had
witnessed, Oromis said, “But still not enough, I fear. You must work harder, Eragon. I know you can.
You are intelligent and persistent, and you have the potential to be a great Rider. As difficult as it is, you
have to learn to put aside your troubles and concentrate entirely on the task at hand. Find peace within
yourself and let your actions flow from there.”
“I’m doing my best.”
“No, this isn’t your best. We shall recognize your best when it appears.” He paused thoughtfully.
“Perhaps it would help if you had a fellow stu-dent to compete with. Then we might see your best.... I
will think on the matter.”
From his cupboards, Oromis produced a loaf of freshly baked bread, a wood jar of hazelnut
butter—which the elves used in place of actual but-ter—and a pair of bowls that he ladled full of a
vegetable stew that had been simmering in a pot hung over a bed of coals in the corner fireplace.
Eragon looked at the stew with distaste; he was sick of the elves’ fare. He longed for meat, fish, or fowl,
something hearty that he could sink his teeth into, not this endless parade of plants. “Master,” he asked to
distract himself, “why do you have me meditate? Is it so that I will understand the doings of the animals
and insects, or is there more to it than that?”
“Can you think of no other motive?” Oromis sighed when Eragon shook his head. “Always it is thus with
my new students, and especially with the human ones; the mind is the last muscle they train or use, and
the one that they regard the least. Ask them about swordplay and they can list every blow from a duel a
month old, but ask them to solve a problem or make a coherent statement and... well, I would be lucky
to get more than a blank stare in return. You are still new to the world of gramarye— as magic is
properly called—but you must begin to consider its full im-plications.”

“How so?”
“Imagine for a moment that you are Galbatorix, with all of his vast re-sources at your command. The
Varden have destroyed your Urgal army with the help of a rival Dragon Rider, who you know was
educated—at least in part—by one of your most dangerous and implacable foes, Brom. You are also
aware that your enemies are massing in Surda for a possible invasion. Given that, what would be the
easiest way to deal with these various threats, short of flying into battle yourself?”
Eragon stirred his stew to cool it while he examined the issue. “It seems to me,” he said slowly, “that the
easiest thing would be to train a corps of magicians—they wouldn’t even have to be that
powerful—force them to swear loyalty to me in the ancient language, then have them infiltrate Surda to
sabotage the Varden’s efforts, poison wells, and assassinate Nasuada, King Orrin, and other key
members of the resistance.”
“And why hasn’t Galbatorix done this yet?”
“Because until now, Surda was of negligible interest to him, and be-cause the Varden have dwelled in
Farthen Dûr for decades, where they were able to examine every newcomer’s mind for duplicity, which
they can’t do in Surda since its border and population are so large.”
“Those are my very conclusions,” said Oromis. “Unless Galbatorix for-sakes his lair in Urû’baen, the
greatest danger you’re likely to encounter during the Varden’s campaign will come from fellow
magicians. You know as well as I how difficult it is to guard against magic, especially if your opponent
has sworn in the ancient language to kill you, no matter the cost. Instead of attempting to first conquer
your mind, such a foe will simply cast a spell to obliterate you, even though—in the instant before you are
destroyed—you will still be free to retaliate. However, you can-not fell your murderer if you don’t know
who or where he is.”
“So sometimes you don’t have to bother taking control of your oppo-nent’s mind?”
“Sometimes, but it’s a risk to avoid.” Oromis paused to consume a few spoonfuls of stew. “Now, to
address the heart of this issue, how do you defend yourself against anonymous enemies who can
contravene any physical precautions and slay with a muttered word?”
“I don’t see how, unless...” Eragon hesitated, then smiled. “Unless I was aware of the consciousnesses
of all the people around me. Then I could sense if they meant me harm.”
Oromis appeared pleased by his answer. “Even so, Eragon-finiarel. And that’s the answer to your
question. Your meditations condition your mind to find and exploit flaws in your enemies’ mental armor,
no matter how small.”
“But won’t another magic user know if I touch their mind?”
“Aye, they will know, but most people won’t. And as for the magicians, they will know, they will be
afraid, and they will shield their minds from you out of their fear, and you will know them because of it.”
“Isn’t it dangerous to leave your consciousness unguarded? If you’re at-tacked mentally, you could
easily be overwhelmed.”
“It’s less dangerous than being blind to the world.”

Eragon nodded. He tapped his spoon against his bowl in a measured meter of time, engrossed in his
thoughts, then said, “It feels wrong.”
“Oh? Explain yourself.”
“What about people’s privacy? Brom taught me to never intrude in someone’s mind unless it was
absolutely necessary.... I guess I’m uncom-fortable with the idea of prying into people’s secrets... secrets
that they have every right to keep to themselves.” He cocked his head. “Why didn’t Brom tell me about
this if it’s so important? Why didn’t he train me in it himself?”
“Brom told you,” said Oromis, “what was appropriate to tell you under the circumstances. Dipping into
the pool of minds can prove addictive to those with a malicious personality or a taste for power. It was
not taught to prospective Riders—though we had them meditate as you do throughout their
training—until we were convinced that they were ma-ture enough to resist temptation.
“It is an invasion of privacy, and you will learn many things from it that you never wanted to. However,
this is for your own good and the good of the Varden. I can say from experience, and from watching
other Riders experience the same, that this, above all else, will help you to understand what drives
people. And understanding begets empathy and compassion, even for the meanest beggar in the meanest
city of Alagaësia.”
They were quiet for a while, eating, then Oromis asked, “Can you tell me, What is the most important
mental tool a person can possess?”
It was a serious question, and Eragon considered it for a reasonable span before he ventured to say,
“Determination.”
Oromis tore the loaf in half with his long white fingers. “I can under-stand why you arrived at that
conclusion—determination has served you well in your adventures—but no. I meant the tool most
necessary to choose the best course of action in any given situation. Determination is as common among
men who are dull and foolish as it is among those who are brilliant intellects. So, no, determination cannot
be what we’re looking for.”
This time Eragon treated the question as he would a riddle, counting the number of words, whispering
them out loud to establish whether they rhymed, and otherwise examining them for hidden meaning. The
problem was, he was no more than a mediocre riddler and had never placed very high in Carvahall’s
annual riddle contest. He thought too lit-erally to work out the answers to riddles that he had not heard
before, a legacy of Garrow’s practical upbringing.
“Wisdom,” he finally said. “Wisdom is the most important tool for a person to possess.”
“A fair guess, but, again, no. The answer is logic. Or, to put it another way, the ability to reason
analytically. Applied properly, it can overcome any lack of wisdom, which one only gains through age
and experience.”
Eragon frowned. “Yes, but isn’t having a good heart more important than logic? Pure logic can lead you
to conclusions that are ethically wrong, whereas if you are moral and righteous, that will ensure that you
don’t act shamefully.”
A razor-thin smile curled Oromis’s lips. “You confuse the issue. All I wanted to know was the most

Page 523

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

useful tool a person can have, regardless of whether that person is good or evil. I agree that it’s
important to be of a virtuous nature, but I would also contend that if you had to choose be-tween giving a
man a noble disposition or teaching him to think clearly, you’d do better to teach him to think clearly.
Too many problems in this world are caused by men with noble dispositions and clouded minds.
“History provides us with numerous examples of people who were convinced that they were doing the
right thing and committed terrible crimes because of it. Keep in mind, Eragon, that no one thinks of
himself as a villain, and few make decisions they think are wrong. A person may dislike his choice, but he
will stand by it because, even in the worst cir-cumstances, he believes that it was the best option available
to him at the time.
“On its own, being a decent person is no guarantee that you will act well, which brings us back to the
one protection we have against dema-gogues, tricksters, and the madness of crowds, and our surest
guide through the uncertain shoals of life: clear and reasoned thinking. Logic will never fail you, unless
you’re unaware of—or deliberately ignore—the consequences of your deeds.”
“If elves are so logical,” said Eragon, “then you must all agree on what to do.”
“Hardly,” averred Oromis. “Like every race, we adhere to a wide range of tenets, and, as a result, we
often arrive at differing conclusions, even in identical situations. Conclusions, I might add, that make
logical sense from each person’s point of view. And although I wish it were otherwise, not all elves have
trained their minds properly.”
“How do you intend to teach me this logic?”
Oromis’s smile broadened. “By the oldest and most effective method: debating. I will ask you a
question, then you will answer and defend your position.” He waited while Eragon refilled his bowl with
stew. “For ex-ample, why do you fight the Empire?”
The sudden change of topic caught Eragon off guard. He had a feeling that Oromis had just reached the
subject that he had been driving toward all along. “As I said before, to help those who suffer from
Galbatorix’s rule and, to a lesser extent, for personal vengeance.”
“Then you fight for humanitarian reasons?”
“What do you mean?”
“That you fight to help the people who Galbatorix has harmed and to stop him from hurting any more.”
“Exactly,” said Eragon.
“Ah, but answer me this, my young Rider: Won’t your war with Galba-torix cause more pain than it will
ever prevent? The majority of people in the Empire live normal, productive lives untouched by their
king’s madness. How can you justify invading their land, destroying their homes, and killing their sons and
daughters?”
Eragon gaped, stunned that Oromis could ask such a question— Galbatorix was evil —and stunned
because no easy reply presented itself. He knew that he was in the right, but how could he prove it?
“Don’t you believe that Galbatorix should be overthrown?”
“That is not the question.”

Page 524

“You must believe it, though,” persisted Eragon. “Look what he did to the Riders.”
Dunking his bread in his stew, Oromis resumed eating, letting Eragon fume in silence. When he finished,
Oromis folded his hands in his lap and asked, “Have I upset you?”
“Yes, you have.”
“I see. Well then, continue to ponder the matter until you find an answer. I expect it to be a convincing
one.”
BLACK MORNING GLORY

They cleared the table and took the dishes outside, where they cleaned them with sand. Oromis
crumbled what remained of the bread around his house for the birds to eat, then they returned inside.
Oromis brought out pens and ink for Eragon, and they resumed his education of the Liduen Kvaedhí, the
written form of the ancient lan-guage, which was so much more elegant than the humans’ or dwarves’
runes. Eragon lost himself in the arcane glyphs, happy to have a task that required nothing more strenuous
than rote memorization.
After hours spent bent over the paper sheets, Oromis waved a hand and said, “Enough. We will
continue this tomorrow.” Eragon leaned back and rolled his shoulders while Oromis selected five scrolls
from their nooks in the wall. “Two of these are in the ancient language, three are in your native tongue.
They will help you to master both alphabets, as well as give you valuable information that would be
tedious for me to vocal-ize.”
“Vocalize?”
With unerring accuracy, Oromis’s hand darted out and plucked a mas-sive sixth scroll from the wall,
which he added to the pyramid in Eragon’s arms. “This is a dictionary. I doubt you can, but try to read it
all.”
When the elf opened the door for him to leave, Eragon said, “Master?”
“Yes, Eragon?”
“When will we start working with magic?”
Oromis leaned on one arm against the doorway, caving in on himself as if he no longer possessed the will
to remain upright. Then he sighed and said, “You must trust me to guide your training, Eragon. Still, I
suppose it would be foolish of me to delay any longer. Come, leave the scrolls on the table, and let us go
explore the mysteries of gramarye.”
On the greensward before the hut, Oromis stood looking out over the Crags of Tel’naeír, his back to
Eragon, his feet shoulder width apart, and his hands clasped in the small of his back. Without turning
around, he asked, “What is magic?”
“The manipulation of energy through the use of the ancient language.”

Page 525

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

There was a pause before Oromis responded. “Technically, you are cor-rect, and many spellcasters
never understand more than that. However, your description fails to capture the essence of magic. Magic
is the art of thinking, not strength or language—you already know that a limited vo-cabulary is no
obstacle to using magic. As with everything else you must master, magic relies on having a disciplined
intellect.
“Brom bypassed the normal training regimen and ignored the subtleties of gramarye to ensure that you
had the skills you needed to remain alive. I too must distort the regimen in order to focus on the skills that
you will likely require in the coming battles. However, whereas Brom taught you the crude mechanics of
magic, I will teach you its finer applications, the secrets that were reserved for the wisest of the Riders:
how you can kill with no more energy than moving your finger, the method by which you can
instantaneously transport an item from one point to another, a spell that will allow you to identify poisons
in your food and drink, a variation on scrying that allows you to hear as well as to see, how you can draw
energy from your surroundings and thus preserve your own strength, and how you can maximize your
strength in every possible way.
“These techniques are so potent and dangerous, they were never shared with novice Riders such as
yourself, but circumstances demand that I di-vulge them and trust that you won’t abuse them.” Raising his
right arm to his side, his hand a hooked claw, Oromis proclaimed, “Adurna!”
Eragon watched as a sphere of water coalesced from the brook by the hut and floated through the air
until it hovered between Oromis’s out-stretched fingers.
The brook was dark and brown under the branches of the forest, but the sphere, removed from it, was
as colorless as glass. Flecks of moss, dirt, and other bits of detritus floated inside the orb.
Still gazing toward the horizon, Oromis said, “Catch.” He tossed the sphere back over his shoulder
toward Eragon.
Eragon tried to grab the ball, but as soon as it touched his skin, the wa-ter lost cohesion and splashed
across his chest.
“Catch it with magic,” said Oromis. Again, he cried, “Adurna!” and a sphere of water gathered itself
from the surface of the brook and leaped into his hand like a trained hawk obeying its master.
This time Oromis threw the ball without warning. Eragon was pre-pared, though, and said, “Reisa du
adurna,” even as he reached for the ball. It slowed to a halt a hairsbreadth from the skin of his palm.
“An awkward word choice,” said Oromis, “but workable, nevertheless.”
Eragon grinned and whispered, “Thrysta.”
The ball reversed its course and sped toward the base of Oromis’s silver head. However, the sphere did
not land where Eragon had intended, but rather shot past the elf, whipped around, and flew back at
Eragon with increased velocity.
The water remained as hard and solid as polished marble when it struck Eragon, producing a dull thunk
as it collided with his skull. The blow knocked him sprawling on the turf, where he lay stunned, blinking
as pulsing lights swam across the sky.

Page 526

“Yes,” said Oromis. “A better word might be letta or kodthr. ” He finally turned to look at Eragon and
raised an eyebrow with apparent surprise. “Whatever are you doing? Get up. We can’t lay about all
day.”
“Yes, Master,” groaned Eragon.
When Eragon got back on his feet, Oromis had him manipulate the wa-ter in various ways—shaping it
into complex knots, changing the color of light that it absorbed or reflected, and freezing it in certain
prescribed se-quences—none of which proved difficult for him.
The exercises continued for so long that Eragon’s initial interest faded and was replaced by impatience
and puzzlement. He was chary of of-fending Oromis, but he saw no point to what the elf was doing; it
was as if Oromis were avoiding any spells that would require him to use more than a minimal amount of
strength. I’ve already demonstrated the extent of my skills. Why does he persist in reviewing these
fundamentals? He said, “Master, I know all of this. Can we not move on?”
The muscles in Oromis’s neck hardened, and his shoulders were like chiseled granite for all they moved;
even the elf’s breathing halted before he said, “Will you never learn respect, Eragon-vodhr? So be it!”
Then he uttered four words from the ancient language in a voice so deep that their meaning escaped
Eragon.
Eragon yelped as he felt each of his legs enveloped by pressure up to the knee, squeezing and
constricting his calves in such a way that made it impossible for him to walk. His thighs and upper body
were free to move, but other than that, it was as if he had been cast in lime mortar.
“Free yourself,” said Oromis.
Here now was a challenge that Eragon had never dealt with before: how to counter someone else’s
spells. He could sever his invisible bonds using one of two different methods. The most effective would
be if he knew how Oromis had immobilized him—whether by affecting his body directly or using an
external source—for then he could redirect the ele-ment or force to disperse Oromis’s power. Or he
could use a generic, vague spell to block whatever Oromis was doing. The downside to the tactic was
that it would lead to a direct contest of strength between them. It had to happen sometime, thought
Eragon. He entertained no hope of prevailing against an elf.
Assembling the required phrase, he said, “Losna kalfya iet.” Release my calves.
The surge of energy that deserted Eragon was greater than he had an-ticipated; he went from being
moderately tired from the day’s pains and exertions to feeling as if he had hiked over rough terrain since
morn. Then the pressure vanished from his legs, causing him to stagger as he re-gained his balance.
Oromis shook his head. “Foolish,” he said, “very foolish. If I had com-mitted more to maintaining my
spell, that would have killed you. Never use absolutes.”
“Absolutes?”
“Never word your spells so that only two outcomes are possible: suc-cess or death. If an enemy had
trapped your legs and if he were stronger than you, then you would have expended all of your energy
trying to break his spell. You would have died with no chance to abort the at-tempt once you realized
that it was futile.”

“How do I avoid that?” asked Eragon.
“It’s safer to make the spell a process that you can terminate at your dis-cretion. Instead of saying
release my calves, which is an absolute, you could say reduce the magic imprisoning my calves. A bit
wordy, but you could then decide how much you wanted your opponent’s spell de-creased and if it were
safe to remove it entirely. We will try again.”
The pressure returned to Eragon’s legs as soon as Oromis mouthed his inaudible invocation. Eragon was
so tired, he doubted that he could pro-vide much opposition. Nevertheless, he reached for the magic.
Before the ancient language left Eragon’s mouth, he became aware of a curious sensation as the weight
constraining his legs lessened at a steady rate. It tickled and felt like he was being pulled out of a mire of
cold, slick mud. He glanced at Oromis and saw the elf’s face scribed by passion, as if he clung to
something precious that he could not bear to lose. A vein throbbed at one of Oromis’s temples.
When Eragon’s arcane fetters ceased to exist, Oromis recoiled as if he had been pricked by a wasp and
stood with his gaze fixed on his two hands, his thin chest heaving. For perhaps a minute, he remained
thus, then he drew himself upright and walked to the very edge of the Crags of Tel’naeír, a lone figure
outlined against the pale sky.
Regret and sorrow welled in Eragon—the same emotions that had gripped him when he first saw
Glaedr’s mutilated foreleg. He cursed himself for being so arrogant with Oromis, so oblivious to his
infirmities, and for not placing more confidence in the elf’s judgment. I’m not the only one who must
deal with past injuries. Eragon had not fully comprehended what it meant when Oromis said that all but
the slightest magic escaped his grasp. Now he appreciated the depths of Oromis’s situation and the pain
that it must cause him, especially for one of his race, who was born and bred with magic.
Eragon went to Oromis, knelt, and bowed in the fashion of the dwarves, pressing his bruised forehead
against the ground. “Ebrithil, I beg your pardon.”
The elf gave no indication that he had heard.
The two of them lingered in their respective positions while the sun declined before them, the birds sang
their evening songs, and the air grew cool and moist. From the north came the faint offbeat thumps of
Saphira and Glaedr’s wing strokes as they returned for the day.
In a low, distant voice, Oromis said, “We will begin anew tomorrow, with this and other subjects.” From
his profile, Eragon could tell that Oromis had regained his customary expression of impassive reserve. “Is
that agreeable to you?”
“Yes, Master,” said Eragon, grateful for the question.
“I think it best if, from now on, you endeavor to speak only in the an-cient language. We have little time
at our disposal, and this is the fastest way for you to learn.”
“Even when I talk to Saphira?”
“Even then.”
Adopting the elven tongue, Eragon vowed, “Then I will work cease-lessly until I not only think, but
dream, in your language.”

Page 528

“If you achieve that,” said Oromis, replying in kind, “our venture may yet succeed.” He paused. “Instead
of flying directly here in the morning, you will accompany the elf I send to guide you. He will take you to
where those of Ellesméra practice swordplay. Stay for an hour, then con-tinue on as normal.”
“Won’t you teach me yourself?” asked Eragon, feeling slighted.
“I have naught to teach. You are as good a swordsman as ever I have met. I know no more of fighting
than you, and that which I possess and you do not, I cannot give you. All that remains for you is to
preserve your current level of skill.”
“Why can’t I do that with you... Master?”
“Because I do not appreciate beginning the day with alarum and con-flict.” He looked at Eragon, then
relented and added, “And because it will be good for you to become acquainted with others who live
here. I am not representative of my race. But enough of that. Look, they approach.”
The two dragons glided across the flat disk of the sun. First came Glaedr with a roar of wind, blotting
out the sky with his massive bulk before he settled on the grass and folded his golden wings, then
Saphira, as quick and agile as a sparrow beside an eagle.
As they had that morning, Oromis and Glaedr asked a number of ques-tions to ensure that Eragon and
Saphira had paid attention to each other’s lessons. They had not always, but by cooperating and sharing
information between themselves, they were able to answer all of the questions. Their only stumbling block
was the foreign language they were required to communicate in.
Better,rumbled Glaedr afterward. Much better. He bent his gaze toward Eragon. You and I will have
to train together soon.
“Of course, Skulblaka.”
The old dragon snorted and crawled alongside Oromis, half hopping with his front leg to compensate for
his missing limb. Darting forward, Saphira nipped at the end of Glaedr’s tail, tossing it into the air with a
flip of her head, like she would to break the neck of a deer. She recoiled as Glaedr twisted round and
snapped at her neck, exposing his enormous fangs.
Eragon winced and, too late, covered his ears to protect them from Glaedr’s roar. The speed and
intensity of Glaedr’s response suggested to Eragon that this was not the first time Saphira had annoyed
him through-out the day. Instead of remorse, Eragon detected an excited playfulness in her—like a child
with a new toy—and a near-blind devotion to the other dragon.
“Contain yourself, Saphira!” said Oromis. Saphira pranced backward and settled on her haunches,
though nothing in her demeanor expressed contrition. Eragon muttered a feeble excuse, and Oromis
waved a hand and said, “Begone, both of you.”
Without arguing, Eragon scrambled onto Saphira. He had to urge her to take flight, and once she did,
she insisted on circling over the clearing three times before he got her to angle toward Ellesméra.
What possessed you to bite him?he demanded. He thought he knew, but he wanted her to confirm it.
I was only playing.

It was the truth, since they spoke in the ancient language, yet he sus-pected that it was but a piece of a
larger truth. Yes, and at what game? She tensed underneath him. You forget your duty. By... He
searched for the right word. Unable to find it, he reverted to his native speech, By pro-voking Glaedr,
you distract him, Oromis, and me—and hinder what we must accomplish. You’ve never been so
thoughtless before.
Do not presume to be my conscience.
He laughed then, heedless for a moment of where he sat among the clouds, rolling to his side until he
almost dropped from the peak of her shoulders. Oh, rich irony that, after the times you’ve told me
what to do. I am your conscience, Saphira, as much as you are mine. You’ve had good reason to
chastise and warn me in the past, and now I must do the same for you: stop pestering Glaedr with
your attentions.
She remained silent.
Saphira?
I hear you.
I hope so.
After a minute of peaceful flying, she said, Two seizures in one day. How are you now?
Sore and ill.He grimaced. Some of it’s from the Rimgar and sparring, but mostly it’s the
aftereffects of the pain. It’s like a poison, weakening my mus-cles and clouding my mind. I just
hope that I can remain sane long enough to reach the end of this training. Afterward, though... I
don’t know what I’ll do. I certainly can’t fight for the Varden like this.
Don’t think about it,she counseled. You can do nothing about your con-dition, and you’ll only make
yourself feel worse. Live in the present, remem-ber the past, and fear not the future, for it doesn’t
exist and never shall. There is only now.
He patted her shoulder and smiled with resigned gratitude. To their right, a goshawk rode a warm air
current while it patrolled the broken forest for signs of furred or feathered quarry. Eragon watched it,
ponder-ing the question that Oromis had given him: How could he justify fight-ing the Empire when it
would cause so much grief and agony?
I have an answer,said Saphira.
What is it?
That Galbatorix has...She hesitated, then said, No, I won’t tell you. You should figure this out for
yourself.
Saphira! Be reasonable.
I am. If you don’t know why what we do is the right thing, you might as well surrender to Galbatorix for
all the good you’ll do.No matter how elo-quent his pleas, he could extract nothing more from her, for she
blocked him from that part of her mind.

Back in their eyrie, Eragon ate a light supper and was just about to open one of Oromis’s scrolls when a
knock on the screen door disturbed his quiet.
“Enter,” he said, hoping that Arya had returned to see him.
She had.
Arya greeted Eragon and Saphira, then said, “I thought that you might appreciate an opportunity to visit
Tialdarí Hall and the adjacent gardens, since you expressed interest in them yesterday. That is, if you
aren’t too tired.” She wore a flowing red kirtle trimmed and decorated with intri-cate designs wrought in
black thread. The color scheme echoed the queen’s robes and emphasized the strong resemblance
between mother and daughter.
Eragon pushed aside the scrolls. “I’d be delighted to see them.”
He meanswe’d be delighted, added Saphira.
Arya looked surprised when both of them spoke in the ancient lan-guage, so Eragon explained Oromis’s
command. “An excellent idea,” said Arya, joining them in the same language. “And it is more appropriate
to speak thus while you stay here.”
When all three of them had descended from the tree, Arya directed them westward toward an unfamiliar
quadrant of Ellesméra. They en-countered many elves on the path, all of whom stopped to bow to
Saphira.
Eragon noticed once again that no elf children were to be seen. He mentioned this to Arya, and she said,
“Aye, we have few children. Only two are in Ellesméra at the present, Dusan and Alanna. We treasure
chil-dren above all else because they are so rare. To have a child is the greatest honor and responsibility
that can be bestowed upon any living being.”
At last they arrived at a ribbed lancet arch—grown between two trees—which served as the entrance
for a wide compound. Still in the ancient language, Arya chanted, “Root of tree, fruit of vine, let me pass
by this blood of mine.”
The two archway doors trembled, then swung outward, releasing five monarch butterflies that fluttered
toward the dusky sky. Through the archway lay a vast flower garden arranged to look as pristine and
natural as a wild meadow. The one element that betrayed artifice was the sheer variety of plants; many of
the species were blooming out of season, or came from hotter or colder climates and would never have
flourished without the elves’ magic. The scene was lit with the gemlike flameless lanterns, augmented by
constellations of swirling fireflies.
To Saphira, Arya said, “Mind your tail, that it does not sweep across the beds.”
Advancing, they crossed the garden and pressed deep into a line of scat-tered trees. Before Eragon
quite knew where he was, the trees became more numerous and then thickened into a wall. He found
himself stand-ing on the threshold of a burnished wood hall without ever being con-scious of having gone
inside.
The hall was warm and homey—a place of peace, reflection, and com-fort. Its shape was determined
by the tree trunks, which on the inside of the hall had been stripped of their bark, polished, and rubbed

Page 531

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

with oil until the wood gleamed like amber. Regular gaps between the trunks acted as windows. The
scent of crushed pine needles perfumed the air. A number of elves occupied the hall, reading, writing,
and, in one dark cor-ner, playing a set of reed pipes. They all paused and inclined their heads to
acknowledge Saphira’s presence.
“Here you would stay,” said Arya, “were you not Rider and dragon.”
“It’s magnificent,” replied Eragon.
Arya guided him and Saphira everywhere in the compound that was accessible to dragons. Each new
room was a surprise; no two were alike, and each chamber found different ways to incorporate the forest
in its construction. In one room, a silver brook trickled down the gnarled wall and flowed across the floor
on a vein of pebbles and back out under the sky. In another, creepers blanketed the entire room, except
for the floor, in a leafy green pelt adorned with trumpet-shaped flowers with the most delicate pink and
white colors. Arya called it the Lianí Vine.
They saw many great works of art, from fairths and paintings to sculp-tures and radiant mosaics of
stained glass—all based on the curved shapes of plants and animals.
Islanzadí met with them for a short time in an open pavilion joined to two other buildings by covered
pathways. She inquired about the pro-gress of Eragon’s training and the state of his back, both of which
he de-scribed with brief, polite phrases. This seemed to satisfy the queen, who exchanged a few words
with Saphira and then departed.
In the end, they returned to the garden. Eragon walked beside Arya— Saphira trailing
behind—entranced by the sound of her voice as she told him about the different varieties of flowers,
where they originated, how they were maintained, and, in many instances, how they had been altered
with magic. She also pointed out the flowers that only opened their pet-als during the night, like a white
datura.
“Which one is your favorite?” he asked.
Arya smiled and escorted him to a tree on the edge of the garden, by a pond lined with rushes. Around
the tree’s lowest branch coiled a morning glory with three velvety black blossoms that were clenched
shut.
Blowing on them, Arya whispered, “Open.”
The petals rustled as they unfurled, fanning their inky robes to expose the hoard of nectar in their centers.
A starburst of royal blue filled the flowers’ throats, diffusing into the sable corolla like the vestiges of day
into night.
“Is it not the most perfect and lovely flower?” asked Arya.
Eragon gazed at her, exquisitely aware of how close they were, and said, “Yes... it is.” Before his
courage deserted him, he added, “As are you.”
Eragon!exclaimed Saphira.
Arya fixed her eyes upon him, studying him until he was forced to look away. When he dared face her
again, he was mortified to see her wearing a faint smile, as if amused by his reaction. “You are too kind,”

Page 532

she mur-mured. Reaching up, she touched the rim of a blossom and glanced from it to him. “Fäolin
created this especially for me one summer solstice, long ago.”
He shuffled his feet and responded with a few unintelligible words, hurt and offended that she did not
take his compliment more seriously. He wished he could turn invisible, and even considered trying to cast
a spell that would allow him to do just that.
In the end, he drew himself upright and said, “Please excuse us, Arya Svit-kona, but it is late, and we
must return to our tree.”
Her smile deepened. “Of course, Eragon. I understand.” She accompa-nied them to the main archway,
opened the doors for them, and said, “Good night, Saphira. Good night, Eragon.”
Good night,replied Saphira.
Despite his embarrassment, Eragon could not help asking, “Will we see you tomorrow?”
Arya tilted her head. “I think I shall be busy tomorrow.” Then the doors closed, cutting off his view of
her as she returned to the main compound.
Crouching low on the path, Saphira nudged Eragon in the side. Stop daydreaming and get on my
back. Climbing up her left foreleg, he took his usual place, then clutched the neck spike in front of him as
Saphira rose to her full height. After a few steps: How can you criticize my behav-ior with Glaedr and
then go and do something like that? What were you thinking?
You know how I feel about her,he grumbled.
Pah! If you are my conscience and I am yours, then it’s my duty to tell you when you’re acting like a
deluded popinjay. You’re not using logic, like Oromis keeps telling us to. What do you really expect to
happen between you and Arya? She’s a princess!
And I’m a Rider.
She’s an elf; you’re a human!
I look more like an elf every day.
Eragon, she’s over a hundred years old!
I’ll live as long as her or any elf.
Ah, but you haven’t yet, and that’s the problem. You can’t overcome such a vast difference. She’s a
grown woman with a century of experience, while you’re—
What? What am I?he snarled. A child? Is that what you mean?
No, not a child. Not after what you have seen and done since we were joined. But you are young, even
by the reckoning of your short-lived race— much less by that of the dwarves, dragons, and elves.
As are you.

Page 533

His retort silenced her for a minute. Then: I’m just trying to protect you, Eragon. That’s all. I want
you to be happy, and I’m afraid you won’t be if you insist on pursuing Arya.
The two of them were about to retire when they heard the trapdoor in the vestibule bang open and the
jingle of mail as someone climbed inside. Zar’roc in hand, Eragon threw back the screen door, ready to
confront the intruder.
His hand dropped as he saw Orik on the floor. The dwarf took a hearty draught from the bottle he
wielded in his left hand, then squinted at Er-agon. “Bricks and bones, where be you? Ah, there you
shtand. I wondered where you were. Couldn’t find you, so I thought that given this fine do-lorous night, I
might go find you... and here you are! What shall we talk about, you and I, now that we’re together in
this delectable bird’s nest?”
Taking hold of the dwarf’s free arm, Eragon pulled him upright, sur-prised, as he always was, by how
dense Orik was, like a miniature boul-der. When Eragon removed his support, Orik swayed from one
side to the other, achieving such precarious angles that he threatened to topple at the slightest
provocation.
“Come on in,” said Eragon in his own language. He closed the trapdoor. “You’ll catch cold out here.”
Orik blinked his round, deep-set eyes at Eragon. “I’ve not sheen you round my leafy exile, no I haven’t.
You’ve abandoned me to the company of elves... and misherable, dull company they are, yesh indeed.”
A touch of guilt made Eragon disguise himself with an awkward smile. He had forgotten the dwarf amid
the goings-on. “I’m sorry I haven’t vis-ited you, Orik, but my studies have kept me busy. Here, give me
your cloak.” As he helped the dwarf out of his brown mantle, he asked, “What are you drinking?”
“Faelnirv,” declared Orik. “A mosht wonderful, ticklish potion. The besht and greatest of the elves’
tricksty inventions; it gives you the gift of loquacion. Words float from your tongue like shoals of flapping
min-nows, like flocks of breathlessh hummingbirds, like rivers of writhing shnakes.” He paused,
apparently taken by the unique magnificence of his similes. As Eragon ushered him into the bedroom,
Orik saluted Saphira with his bottle and said, “Greetings, O Irontooth. May your shcales shine as bright
as the coals of Morgothal’s forge.”
Greetings, Orik,said Saphira, laying her head on the rim of her bed. What has put you in this state? It
is not like you. Eragon repeated her question.
“What has put me in mine shtate?” repeated Orik. He dropped into the chair that Eragon provided—his
feet dangling several inches above the ground—and began to shake his head. “Red cap, green cap, elves
here and elves there. I drown in elvesh and their thrice-damned courtesy. Bloodless they be. Taciturn
they are. Yesh sir, no shir, three bagsh full, sir, yet nary a pip more can I extract.” He looked at Eragon
with a mournful expres-sion. “What am I to do while you meander through your instruction? Am I to sit
and twiddle mine thumbs while I turn to shtone and join the shpirits of mine anshestors? Tell me, O
sagacious Rider.”
Have you no skills or hobbies that you might occupy yourself with?asked Saphira.
“Aye,” said Orik. “I’m a fair enough smith by any who’d care to judge. But why should I craft bright
armsh and armor for those who treasure them not? I’m usheless here. As usheless as a three-legged
Feldûnost.”

Page 534

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Eragon extended a hand toward the bottle. “May I?” Orik glanced be-tween him and the bottle, then
grimaced and gave it up. The faelnirv was cold as ice as it ran down Eragon’s throat, stinging and
smarting. He blinked as his eyes watered. After he indulged in a second quaff, he passed the bottle back
to Orik, who seemed disappointed by how little of the concoction remained.
“And what mischief,” asked Orik, “have you two managed to ferret out of Oromis and yon bucolic
woods?”
The dwarf alternately chuckled and groaned as Eragon described his training, his misplaced blessing in
Farthen Dûr, the Menoa tree, his back, and all else that had filled the past few days. Eragon ended with
the topic that was dearest to him at the moment: Arya. Emboldened by the li-queur, he confessed his
affection for her and described how she had dis-missed his advance.
Wagging a finger, Orik said, “The rock beneath you is flawed, Eragon. Don’t tempt fate. Arya...” He
stopped, then growled and took another gulp of faelnirv. “Ah, it’s too late for thish. Who am I to say
what is wis-dom and what isn’t?”
Saphira had closed her eyes a while ago. Without opening them, she asked, Are you married, Orik?
The question surprised Eragon; he had never stopped to wonder about Orik’s personal life.
“Eta,” said Orik. “Although I’m promished to fair Hvedra, daughter of Thorgerd One-eye and
Himinglada. We were to be wed thish spring, un-til the Urgals attacked and Hrothgar sent me on this
accursed trip.”
“Is she of Dûrgrimst Ingeitum?” asked Eragon.
“Of coursh!” roared Orik, pounding his fist on the side of the chair. “Thinkest thou I would marry
outside my clan? She’s the granddaughter of mine aunt Vardrûn, Hrothgar’s coushin twice removed, with
white, round calves as smooth as satin, cheeks as red as apples, and the pretti-esht dwarf maid who ever
did exist.”
Undoubtedly,said Saphira.
“I’m sure it won’t be long before you see her again,” said Eragon.
“Hmph.” Orik squinted at Eragon. “Do you believe in giants? Tall giants, shtrong giants, thick and
bearded giants with fingers like spadeses?”
“I’ve never seen nor heard of them,” said Eragon, “except in stories. If they do exist, it’s not in
Alagaësia.”
“Ah, but they do! They do!” exclaimed Orik, waving the bottle about his head. “Tell me, O Rider, if a
fearshome giant were to meet you on the garden path, what might he call you, if not dinner?”
“Eragon, I would presume.”
“No, no. He’d call you a dwarf, for dwarf you’d be to him.” Orik guf-fawed and nudged Eragon in the
ribs with his hard elbow. “See you now? Humans and elvesh are the giants. The land’s full of them, here,
there, and everywhere, stomping about with their big feet and casting us in endless shadowses.” He
continued laughing, rocking back in his chair until it tipped over and he fell to the floor with a solid thump.

Page 535

Helping him upright, Eragon said, “I think you’d better stay here for the night. You’re in no condition to
go down those stairs in the dark.”
Orik agreed with cheery indifference. He allowed Eragon to remove his mail and bundle him onto one
side of the bed. Afterward, Eragon sighed, covered the lights, and lay on his side of the mattress.
He fell asleep hearing the dwarf mutter, “... Hvedra... Hvedra... Hvedra...”
THE NATURE OF EVIL

Bright morning arrived all too soon.
Jolted to awareness by the buzz of the vibrating timepiece, Eragon grabbed his hunting knife and sprang
out of bed, expecting an attack. He gasped as his body shrieked with protest from the abuse of the past
two days.
Blinking away tears, Eragon rewound the timepiece. Orik was gone; the dwarf must have slipped away
in the wee hours of the morning. With a groan, Eragon hobbled to the wash closet for his daily ablutions,
like an old man afflicted by rheumatism.
He and Saphira waited by the tree for ten minutes before they were met by a solemn, black-haired elf.
The elf bowed, touched two fingers to his lips—which Eragon mirrored—and then preempted Eragon by
saying, “May good fortune rule over you.”
“And may the stars watch over you,” replied Eragon. “Did Oromis send you?”
The elf ignored him and said to Saphira, “Well met, dragon. I am Vanir of House Haldthin.” Eragon
scowled with annoyance.
Well met, Vanir.
Only then did the elf address Eragon: “I will show you where you may practice with your blade.” He
strode away, not waiting for Eragon to catch up.
The sparring yard was dotted with elves of both sexes fighting in pairs and groups. Their extraordinary
physical gifts resulted in flurries of blows so quick and fast, they sounded like bursts of hail striking an
iron bell. Under the trees that fringed the yard, individual elves performed the Rimgar with more grace
and flexibility than Eragon thought he would ever achieve.
After everyone on the field stopped and bowed to Saphira, Vanir un-sheathed his narrow blade. “If you
will guard your sword, Silver Hand, we can begin.”
Eragon eyed the inhuman swordsmanship of the other elves with trepi
dation. Why do I have to do this? he asked. I’ll just be humiliated.
You’ll be fine,said Saphira, yet he could sense her concern for him.
Right.

Page 536

As he prepared Zar’roc, Eragon’s hands trembled with dread. Instead of throwing himself into the fray,
he fought Vanir from a distance, dodging, sidestepping, and doing everything possible to avoid triggering
another fit. Despite Eragon’s evasions, Vanir touched him four times in rapid succes-sion—once each on
his ribs, shin, and both shoulders.
Vanir’s initial expression of stoic impassivity soon devolved into open contempt. Dancing forward, he
slid his blade up Zar’roc’s length while at the same time twirling Zar’roc in a circle, wrenching Eragon’s
wrist. Er-agon allowed Zar’roc to fly out of his hand rather than resist the elf’s su-perior strength.
Vanir dropped his sword onto Eragon’s neck and said, “Dead.” Shrug-ging off the sword, Eragon
trudged over to retrieve Zar’roc. “Dead,” said Vanir. “How do you expect to defeat Galbatorix like this?
I expected better, even from a weakling human.”
“Then why don’t you fight Galbatorix yourself instead of hiding in Du Weldenvarden?”
Vanir stiffened with outrage. “Because,” he said, cool and haughty, “I’m not a Rider. And if I were, I
would not be such a coward as you.”
No one moved or spoke on the field.
His back to Vanir, Eragon leaned on Zar’roc and craned his neck to-ward the sky, snarling to himself.
He knows nothing. This is just one more test to overcome.
“Coward, I say. Your blood is as thin as the rest of your race’s. I think that Saphira was confused by
Galbatorix’s wiles and made the wrong choice of Rider.” The spectating elves gasped at Vanir’s words
and mut-tered among themselves with open disapproval for his atrocious breach of etiquette.
Eragon ground his teeth. He could stand insults to himself, but not to Saphira. She was already moving
when his pent-up frustration, fear, and pain burst within him and he whirled around, the tip of Zar’roc
whistling through the air.
The blow would have killed Vanir had he not blocked it at the last second. He looked surprised by the
ferocity of the attack. Holding noth-ing in reserve, Eragon drove Vanir to the center of the field, jabbing
and slashing like a madman—determined to hurt the elf however he could. He nicked Vanir on the hip
with enough force to draw blood, even with Zar’roc’s blunted edge.
At that instant, Eragon’s back ruptured in an explosion of agony so in-tense, he experienced it with all
five senses: as a deafening, crashing wa-terfall of sound; a metallic taste that coated his tongue; an acrid,
eye-watering stench in his nostrils, redolent of vinegar; pulsing colors; and, above all, the feeling that
Durza had just laid open his back.
He could see Vanir standing over him with a derisive sneer. It occurred to Eragon that Vanir was very
young.
After the seizure, Eragon wiped the blood from his mouth with his hand and showed it to Vanir, asking,
“Thin enough?” Vanir did not deign to respond, but rather sheathed his sword and walked away.
“Where are you going?” demanded Eragon. “We have unfinished busi-ness, you and I.”
“You are in no fit condition to spar,” scoffed the elf.

Page 537

“Try me.” Eragon might be inferior to the elves, but he refused to give them the satisfaction of fulfilling
their low expectations of him. He would earn their respect through sheer persistence, if nothing else.
He insisted on completing Oromis’s assigned hour, after which Saphira marched up to Vanir and
touched him on the chest with the point of one of her ivory talons. Dead, she said. Vanir paled. The other
elves edged away from him.
Once they were in the air, Saphira said, Oromis was right.
About what?
You give more of yourself when you have an opponent.
At Oromis’s hut, the day resumed its usual pattern: Saphira accompa-nied Glaedr for her instruction
while Eragon remained with Oromis.
Eragon was horrified when he discovered that Oromis expected him to do the Rimgar in addition to his
earlier exercises. It took all of his courage to obey. His apprehension proved groundless, though, for the
Dance of Snake and Crane was too gentle to injure him.
That, coupled with his meditation in the secluded glade, provided Er-agon with his first opportunity since
the previous day to order his thoughts and consider the question that Oromis had posed him.
While he did, he observed his red ants invade a smaller, rival anthill, overrunning the inhabitants and
stealing their resources. By the end of the massacre, only a handful of the rival ants were left alive, alone
and pur-poseless in the vast and hostile pine-needle barrens.
Like the dragons in Alagaësia,thought Eragon. His connection to the ants vanished as he considered the
dragons’ unhappy fate. Bit by bit, an answer to his problem revealed itself to him, an answer that he
could live with and believe in.
He finished his meditations and returned to the hut. This time Oromis seemed reasonably satisfied with
what Eragon had accomplished.
As Oromis served the midday meal, Eragon said, “I know why fighting Galbatorix is worth it, though
thousands of people may die.”
“Oh?” Oromis seated himself. “Do tell me.”
“Because Galbatorix has already caused more suffering over the past hundred years than we ever could
in a single generation. And unlike a normal tyrant, we cannot wait for him to die. He could rule for
centuries or millennia—persecuting and tormenting people the entire time—unless we stop him. If he
became strong enough, he would march on the dwarves and you here in Du Weldenvarden and kill or
enslave both races. And...,” Eragon rubbed the heel of his palm against the edge of the table, “... because
rescuing the two eggs from Galbatorix is the only way to save the dragons.”
The strident warble of Oromis’s teakettle intruded, escalating in vol-ume until Eragon’s ears rang.
Standing, Oromis hooked the kettle off the cookfire and poured the water for blueberry tea. The creases
around his eyes softened. “Now,” he said, “you understand.”

“I understand, but I take no pleasure in it.”
“Nor should you. But now we can be confident that you won’t shrink from the path when you are
confronted by the injustices and atrocities that the Varden will inevitably commit. We cannot afford to
have you consumed by doubts when your strength and focus are most needed.” Oromis steepled his
fingers and gazed into the dark mirror of his tea, con-templating whatever he saw in its tenebrous
reflection. “Do you believe that Galbatorix is evil?”
“Of course!”
“Do you believe that he considers himself evil?”
“No, I doubt it.”
Oromis tapped his forefingers against each other. “Then you must also believe that Durza was evil?”
The fragmented memories Eragon had gleaned from Durza when they fought in Tronjheim returned to
him now, reminding him how the young Shade—Carsaib, then—had been enslaved by the wraiths he had
sum-moned to avenge the death of his mentor, Haeg. “He wasn’t evil himself, but the spirits that
controlled him were.”
“And what of the Urgals?” asked Oromis, sipping his tea. “Are they evil?”
Eragon’s knuckles whitened as he gripped his spoon. “When I think of death, I see an Urgal’s face.
They’re worse than beasts. The things they have done...” He shook his head, unable to continue.
“Eragon, what kind of opinion would you form of humans if all you knew of them were the actions of
your warriors on the field of battle?”
“That’s not...” He took a deep breath. “It’s different. Urgals deserve to be wiped out, every last one of
them.”
“Even their females and children? The ones who haven’t harmed you and likely never will? The
innocents? Would you kill them and condemn an entire race to the void?”
“They wouldn’t spare us, given the chance.”
“Eragon!” exclaimed Oromis in biting tones. “I never want to hear you use that excuse again, that
because someone else has done—or would do—something means that you should too. It’s lazy,
repugnant, and in-dicative of an inferior mind. Am I clear?”
“Yes, Master.”
The elf raised his mug to his lips and drank, his bright eyes fixed on Er-agon the entire time. “What do
you actually know of Urgals?”
“I know their strengths, weaknesses, and how to kill them. It’s all I need to know.”
“Why do they hate and fight humans, though? What about their history and legends, or the way in which
they live?”

Page 539

“Does it matter?”
Oromis sighed. “Just remember,” he said gently, “that at a certain point, your enemies may have to
become your allies. Such is the nature of life.”
Eragon resisted the urge to argue. He swirled his own tea in its mug, ac-celerating the liquid into a black
whirlpool with a white lens of foam at the bottom of the vortex. “Is that why Galbatorix enlisted the
Urgals?”
“That is not an example I would have chosen, but yes.”
“It seems strange that he befriended them. After all, they were the ones who killed his dragon. Look
what he did to us, the Riders, and we weren’t even responsible for his loss.”
“Ah,” said Oromis, “mad Galbatorix may be, but he’s still as cunning as a fox. I guess that he intended to
use the Urgals to destroy the Varden and the dwarves—and others, if he had triumphed in Farthen
Dûr— thereby removing two of his enemies while simultaneously weakening the Urgals so that he could
dispose of them at his leisure.”
Study of the ancient language devoured the afternoon, whereupon they took up the practice of magic.
Much of Oromis’s lectures concerned the proper way in which to control various forms of energy, such
as light, heat, electricity, and even gravity. He explained that since these forces consumed strength faster
than any other type of spell, it was safer to find them already in existence in nature and then shape them
with gramarye, instead of trying to create them from nothing.
Abandoning the subject, Oromis asked, “How would you kill with magic?”
“I’ve done it many ways,” said Eragon. “I’ve hunted with a pebble— moving and aiming it with
magic—as well as using the word jierda to break Urgals’ legs and necks. Once, with thrysta, I stopped
a man’s heart.”
“There are more efficient methods,” revealed Oromis. “What does it take to kill a man, Eragon? A
sword through the chest? A broken neck? The loss of blood? All it takes is for a single artery in the brain
to be pinched off, or for certain nerves to be severed. With the right spell, you could obliterate an army.”
“I should have thought of that in Farthen Dûr,” said Eragon, disgusted with himself. Not just Farthen
Dûr either, but also when the Kull chased us from the Hadarac Desert. “Again, why didn’t Brom
teach me this?”
“Because he did not expect you to face an army for months or years to come; it is not a tool given to
untested Riders.”
“If it’s so easy to kill people, though, what’s the point of us or Galba-torix raising an army?”
“To be succinct, tactics. Magicians are vulnerable to physical attack when they are embroiled in their
mental struggles. Therefore, they need warriors to protect them. And the warriors must be shielded, at
least in part, from magical attacks, else they would be slain within minutes. These limitations mean that
when armies confront one another, their magicians are scattered throughout the bulk of their forces, close
to the edge but not so close as to be in danger. The magicians on both sides open their minds and
attempt to sense if anyone is using or is about to use magic. Since their enemies might be beyond their
mental reach, ma-gicians also erect wards around themselves and their warriors to stop or lessen

Page 540

long-range attacks, such as a pebble sent flying toward their head from a mile away.”
“Surely one man can’t defend an entire army,” said Eragon.
“Not alone, but with enough magicians, you can provide a reasonable amount of protection. The greatest
danger in this sort of conflict is that a clever magician may think of a unique attack that can bypass your
wards without tripping them. That itself could be enough to decide a battle.
“Also,” said Oromis, “you must keep in mind that the ability to use magic is exceedingly rare among the
races. We elves are no exception, although we have a greater allotment of spellweavers than most, as a
re-sult of oaths we bound ourselves with centuries ago. The majority of those blessed with magic have
little or no appreciable talent; they strug-gle to heal even so much as a bruise.”
Eragon nodded. He had encountered magicians like that in the Varden. “But it still takes the same
amount of energy to accomplish a task.”
“Energy, yes, but lesser magicians find it harder than you or I do to feel the flow of magic and immerse
themselves in it. Few magicians are strong enough to pose a threat to an entire army. And those who are
usually spend the bulk of their time during battles evading, tracking, or fighting their opposites, which is
fortunate from the standpoint of ordinary war-riors, else they would all soon be killed.”
Troubled, Eragon said, “The Varden don’t have many magicians.”
“That is one reason why you are so important.”
A moment passed as Eragon reflected on what Oromis had told him. “These wards, do they only drain
energy from you when they are acti-vated?”
“Aye.”
“Then, given enough time, you could acquire countless layers of wards. You could make yourself...” He
struggled with the ancient language as he attempted to express himself. “... untouchable?...
impregnable?... impreg-nable to any assault, magical or physical.”
“Wards,” said Oromis, “rely upon the strength of your body. If that strength is exceeded, you die. No
matter how many wards you have, you will only be able to block attacks so long as your body can
sustain the output of energy.”
“And Galbatorix’s strength has been increasing each year.... How is that possible?”
It was a rhetorical question, yet when Oromis remained silent, his al-mond eyes fixed on a trio of
swallows pirouetting overhead, Eragon real-ized that the elf was considering how best to answer him.
The birds chased each other for several minutes. When they flitted from view, Oromis said, “It is not
appropriate to have this discussion at the present.”
“Then you know?” exclaimed Eragon, astonished.
“I do. But that information must wait until later in your training. You are not ready for it.” Oromis looked
at Eragon, as if expecting him to ob-ject.
Eragon bowed. “As you wish, Master.” He could never prize the infor-mation out of Oromis until the elf

Page 541

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

was willing to share it, so why try? Still, he wondered what could be so dangerous that Oromis dared not
tell him, and why the elves had kept it secret from the Varden. Another thought presented itself to him,
and he said, “If battles with magicians are conducted like you said, then why did Ajihad let me fight
without wards in Farthen Dûr? I didn’t even know that I needed to keep my mind open for enemies. And
why didn’t Arya kill most or all of the Urgals? No ma-gicians were there to oppose her except for Durza,
and he couldn’t have defended his troops when he was underground.”
“Did not Ajihad have Arya or one of Du Vrangr Gata set defenses around you?” demanded Oromis.
“No, Master.”
“And you fought thus?”
“Yes, Master.”
Oromis’s eyes unfocused, withdrawing into himself as he stood mo-tionless on the greensward. He
spoke without warning: “I have consulted Arya, and she says that the Twins of the Varden were ordered
to assess your abilities. They told Ajihad you were competent in all magic, includ-ing wards. Neither
Ajihad nor Arya doubted their judgment on that mat-ter.”
“Those smooth-tongued, bald-pated, tick-infested, treacherous dogs,” swore Eragon. “They tried to get
me killed!” Reverting to his own lan-guage, he indulged in several more pungent oaths.
“Do not befoul the air,” said Oromis mildly. “It ill becomes you.... In any case, I suspect the Twins
allowed you into battle unprotected not so you would be killed, but so that Durza could capture you.”
“What?”
“By your own account, Ajihad suspected that the Varden had been be-trayed when Galbatorix began
persecuting their allies in the Empire with near-perfect accuracy. The Twins were privy to the identities of
the Varden’s collaborators. Also, the Twins lured you to the heart of Tron-jheim, thereby separating you
from Saphira and placing you within Durza’s reach. That they were traitors is the logical explanation.”
“If they were traitors,” said Eragon, “it doesn’t matter now; they’re long dead.”
Oromis inclined his head. “Even so. Arya said that the Urgals did have magicians in Farthen Dûr and that
she fought many of them. None of them attacked you?”
“No, Master.”
“More evidence that you and Saphira were left for Durza to capture and take to Galbatorix. The trap
was well laid.”
Over the next hour, Oromis taught Eragon twelve methods to kill, none of which took more energy than
lifting an ink-laden pen. As he fin-ished memorizing the last one, a thought struck Eragon that caused him
to grin. “The Ra’zac won’t stand a chance the next time they cross my path.”
“You must still be wary of them,” cautioned Oromis.
“Why? Three words and they’ll be dead.”

Page 542

“What do ospreys eat?”
Eragon blinked. “Fish, of course.”
“And if a fish were slightly faster and more intelligent than its brethren, would it be able to escape a
hunting osprey?”
“I doubt it,” said Eragon. “At least not for very long.”
“Just as ospreys are designed to be the best possible hunters of fish, wolves are designed to be the best
hunters of deer and other large game, and every animal is gifted to best suit its purpose. So too are the
Ra’zac designed to prey upon humans. They are the monsters in the dark, the dripping nightmares that
haunt your race.”
The back of Eragon’s neck prickled with horror. “What manner of crea-tures are they?”
“Neither elf; man; dwarf; dragon; furred, finned, or feathered beast; rep-tile; insect; nor any other
category of animal.”
Eragon forced a laugh. “Are they plants, then?”
“Nor that either. They reproduce by laying eggs, like dragons. When they hatch, the young—or
pupae—grow black exoskeletons that mimic the human form. It’s a grotesque imitation, but convincing
enough to let the Ra’zac approach their victims without undo alarm. All areas where humans are weak,
the Ra’zac are strong. They can see on a cloudy night, track a scent like a bloodhound, jump higher, and
move faster. However, bright light pains them and they have a morbid fear of deep water, for they cannot
swim. Their greatest weapon is their evil breath, which fogs the minds of humans—incapacitating
many—though it is less potent on dwarves, and elves are immune altogether.”
Eragon shivered as he remembered his first sight of the Ra’zac in Car-vahall and how he had been
unable to flee once they noticed him. “It felt like a dream where I wanted to run but I couldn’t move, no
matter how hard I tried.”
“As good a description as any,” said Oromis. “Though the Ra’zac cannot use magic, they are not to be
underestimated. If they know that you hunt them, they will not reveal themselves but keep to the
shadows, where they are strong, and plot to ambush you as they did by Dras-Leona. Even Brom’s
experience could not protect him from them. Never grow over-confident, Eragon. Never grow arrogant,
for then you will be careless and your enemies will exploit your weakness.”
“Yes, Master.”
Oromis fixed Eragon with a steady gaze. “The Ra’zac remain pupae for twenty years while they mature.
On the first full moon of their twentieth year, they shed their exoskeletons, spread their wings, and
emerge as adults ready to hunt all creatures, not just humans.”
“Then the Ra’zac’s mounts, the ones they fly on, are really...” “Aye, their parents.”
IMAGE OF PERFECTION

At last I understand the nature of my enemies,thought Eragon. He had feared the Ra’zac ever since they
first appeared in Carvahall, not only be-cause of their villainous deeds but because he knew so little
about the creatures. In his ignorance, he credited the Ra’zac with more powers than they actually
possessed and regarded them with an almost superstitious dread. Nightmares indeed. But now that
Oromis’s explanation had stripped away the Ra’zac’s aura of mystery, they no longer seemed quite so
formidable. The fact that they were vulnerable to light and water strengthened Eragon’s conviction that
when next they met, he would de-stroy the monsters that had killed Garrow and Brom.
“Are their parents called Ra’zac as well?” he asked.
Oromis shook his head. “Lethrblaka, we named them. And whereas their offspring are narrow-minded,
if cunning, Lethrblaka have all the in-telligence of a dragon. A cruel, vicious, and twisted dragon.”
“Where do they come from?”
“From whatever land your ancestors abandoned. Their depredations may have been what forced King
Palancar to emigrate. When we, the Riders, became aware of the Ra’zac’s foul presence in Alagaësia,
we did our best to eradicate them, as we would leaf blight. Unfortunately, we were only partially
successful. Two Lethrblaka escaped, and they along with their pupae are the ones who have caused you
so much grief. After he killed Vrael, Galbatorix sought them out and bargained for their ser-vices in return
for his protection and a guaranteed amount of their favor-ite food. That is why Galbatorix allows them to
live by Dras-Leona, one of the Empire’s largest cities.”
Eragon’s jaw tightened. “They have much to answer for.” And they will, if I have my way.
“That they do,” Oromis agreed. Returning to the hut, he stepped through the black shadow of the
doorway, then reappeared carrying a half-dozen slate tablets about a half-foot wide and a foot high. He
pre-sented one to Eragon. “Let us abandon such unpleasant topics for a time. I thought you might enjoy
learning how to make a fairth. It is an excellent device for focusing your thoughts. The slate is
impregnated with enough ink to cover it with any combination of colors. All you need do is con-centrate
upon the image that you wish to capture and then say, ‘Let that which I see in my mind’s eye be
replicated on the surface of this tablet.’ ” As Eragon examined the clay-smooth slate, Oromis gestured at
the clear-ing. “Look about you, Eragon, and find something worth preserving.”
The first objects that Eragon noticed seemed too obvious, too banal to him: a yellow lily by his feet,
Oromis’s overgrown hut, the white stream, and the landscape itself. None were unique. None would give
an observer an insight into the subject of the fairth or he who had created it. Things that change and
are lost, that is what’s worth preserving, he thought. His eye alighted upon the pale green nubs of
spring growth at the tip of a tree’s branches and then the deep, narrow wound that seamed the trunk
where a storm had broken a bough, tearing off a rope of bark with it. Translucent orbs of sap encrusted
the seam, catching and refracting the light.
Eragon positioned himself alongside the trunk so that the rotund galls of the tree’s congealed blood
bulged out in silhouette and were framed by a cluster of shiny new needles. Then he fixed the scene in his
mind as best he could and uttered the spell.
The surface of the gray tablet brightened as splashes of color bloomed across it, blending and mixing to
produce the proper array of hues. When the pigments at last stopped moving, Eragon found himself
looking at a strange copy of what he had wanted to reproduce. The sap and needles were rendered with
vibrant, razor-sharp detail, while all else was slurred and bleary, as if seen through half-opened eyes. It
was far removed from the universal clarity of Oromis’s fairth of Ilirea.

Page 544

At a sign from Oromis, Eragon handed the tablet to him. The elf stud-ied it for a minute, then said, “You
have an unusual way of thinking, Er-agon-finiarel. Most humans have difficulty achieving the proper
concen-tration to create a recognizable image. You, on the other hand, seem to observe nearly
everything about whatever interests you. It’s a narrow fo-cus, though. You have the same problem here
that you do with your meditation. You must relax, broaden your field of vision, and allow your-self to
absorb everything around you without judging what is important or not.” Setting aside the picture, Oromis
took a second, blank tablet from the grass and gave it to Eragon. “Try again with what I—”
“Hail, Rider!”
Startled, Eragon turned and saw Orik and Arya emerge side by side from the forest. The dwarf raised
his arm in greeting. His beard was freshly trimmed and braided, his hair was pulled back into a neat
ponytail, and he wore a new tunic—courtesy of the elves—that was red and brown and embroidered
with gold thread. His appearance gave no indica-tion of his condition the previous night.
Eragon, Oromis, and Arya exchanged the traditional greeting, then, abandoning the ancient language,
Oromis asked, “To what may I attribute this visit? You are both welcome to my hut, but as you can see,
I am in the midst of working with Eragon, and that is of paramount importance.”
“I apologize for disturbing you, Oromis-elda,” said Arya, “but—”
“The fault is mine,” said Orik. He glanced at Eragon before continuing: “I was sent here by Hrothgar to
ensure that Eragon receives the instruc-tion he is due. I have no doubt that he is, but I am obliged to see
his training with my own eyes so that when I return to Tronjheim, I may give my king a true account of
events.”
Oromis said, “That which I teach Eragon is not to be shared with any-one else. The secrets of the Riders
are for him alone.”
“And I understand that. However, we live in uncertain times; the stone that once was fixed and solid is
now unstable. We must adapt to survive. So much depends on Eragon, we dwarves have a right to verify
that his training proceeds as promised. Do you believe our request is an unrea-sonable one?”
“Well spoken, Master Dwarf,” said Oromis. He tapped his fingers to-gether, inscrutable as always.
“May I assume, then, that this is a matter of duty for you?”
“Duty and honor.”
“And neither will allow you to yield on this point?”
“I fear not, Oromis-elda,” said Orik.
“Very well. You may stay and watch for the duration of this lesson. Will that satisfy you?”
Orik frowned. “Are you near the end of the lesson?”
“We have just begun.”
“Then yes, I will be satisfied. For the moment, at least.”

Page 545

While they spoke, Eragon tried to catch Arya’s eye, but she kept her at-tention centered on Oromis.
“... Eragon!”
He blinked, jolted out of his reverie. “Yes, Master?”
“Don’t wander, Eragon. I want you to make another fairth. Keep your mind open, like I told you
before.”
“Yes, Master.” Eragon hefted the tablet, his hands slightly damp at the thought of having Orik and Arya
there to judge his performance. He wanted to do well in order to prove that Oromis was a good teacher.
Even so, he could not concentrate on the pine needles and sap; Arya tugged at him like a lodestone,
drawing his attention back to her when-ever he thought of something else.
At last he realized that it was futile for him to resist the attraction. He composed an image of her in his
head—which took but a heartbeat, since he knew her features better than his own—and voiced the spell
in the ancient language, pouring all of his adoration, love, and fear of her into the currents of fey magic.
The result left him speechless.
The fairth depicted Arya’s head and shoulders against a dark, indistinct background. She was bathed in
firelight on her right side and gazed out at the viewer with knowing eyes, appearing not just as she was
but as he thought of her: mysterious, exotic, and the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. It was a
flawed, imperfect picture, but it possessed such inten-sity and passion that it evoked a visceral response
from Eragon. Is this how I really see her? Whoever this woman was, she was so wise, so pow-erful,
and so hypnotic, she could consume any lesser man.
From a great distance, he heard Saphira whisper, Be careful....
“What have you wrought, Eragon?” demanded Oromis.
“I... I don’t know.” Eragon hesitated as Oromis extended his hand for the fairth, reluctant to let the
others examine his work, especially Arya. After a long, terrifying pause, Eragon pried his fingers off the
tablet and released it to Oromis.
The elf’s expression grew stern as he looked at the fairth, then back at Eragon, who quailed under the
weight of his stare. Without a word, Oromis handed the tablet to Arya.
Her hair obscured her face as she bowed over the tablet, but Eragon saw cords and veins ridge her
hands as she clenched the slate. It shook in her grip.
“Well, what is it?” asked Orik.
Raising the fairth over her head, Arya hurled it against the ground, shat-tering the picture into a thousand
pieces. Then she drew herself upright and, with great dignity, walked past Eragon, across the clearing,
and into the tangled depths of Du Weldenvarden.
Orik picked up one of the fragments of slate. It was blank. The image had vanished when the tablet
broke. He tugged his beard. “In all the dec-ades I’ve known her, Arya has never lost her temper like
that. Never. What did you do, Eragon?”

Page 546

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Dazed, Eragon said, “A portrait of her.”
Orik frowned, obviously puzzled. “A portrait? Why would that—”
“I think it would be best if you left now,” said Oromis. “The lesson is over, in any case. Come back
tomorrow or the day after if you want a better idea of Eragon’s progress.”
The dwarf squinted at Eragon, then nodded and brushed the dirt from his palms. “Yes, I believe I’ll do
that. Thank you for your time, Oromis-elda. I appreciate it.” As he headed back toward Ellesméra, he
said over his shoulder to Eragon, “I’ll be in the common room of Tialdarí Hall, if you want to talk.”
When Orik was gone, Oromis lifted the hem of his tunic, knelt, and began to gather up the remains of the
tablet. Eragon watched him, unable to move.
“Why?” he asked in the ancient language.
“Perhaps,” said Oromis, “Arya was frightened by you.”
“Frightened? She never gets frightened.” Even as he said it, Eragon knew that it was not true. She just
concealed her fear better than most. Dropping to one knee, he took a piece of the fairth and pressed it
into Oromis’s palm. “Why would I frighten her?” he asked. “Please, tell me.”
Oromis stood and walked to the edge of the stream, where he scattered the fragments of slate over the
bank, letting the gray flakes trickle through his fingers. “Fairths only show what you want them to. It’s
possi-ble to lie with them, to create a false image, but to do so requires more skill than you yet have.
Arya knows this. She also knows, then, that your fairth was an accurate representation of your feelings
for her.”
“But why would that frighten her?”
Oromis smiled sadly. “Because it revealed the depth of your infatua-tion.” He pressed his fingertips
together, forming a series of arches. “Let us analyze the situation, Eragon. While you are old enough to
be consid-ered a man among your people, in our eyes, you are no more than a child.” Eragon frowned,
hearing echoes of Saphira’s words from the pre-vious night. “Normally, I would not compare a human’s
age to an elf’s, but since you share our longevity, you must also be judged by our stan-dards.
“And you are a Rider. We rely upon you to help us defeat Galbatorix; it could be disastrous for
everyone in Alagaësia if you are distracted from your studies.
“Now then,” said Oromis, “how should Arya have responded to your fairth? It’s clear that you see her
in a romantic light, yet—while I have no doubt Arya is fond of you—a union between the two of you is
impossi-ble due to your own youth, culture, race, and responsibilities. Your inter-est has placed Arya in
an uncomfortable position. She dare not confront you, for fear of disrupting your training. But, as the
queen’s daughter, she cannot ignore you and risk offending a Rider—especially one upon which so much
depends.... Even if you were a fit match, Arya would refrain from encouraging you so that you could
devote all of your energy to the task at hand. She would sacrifice her happiness for the greater good.”
Oromis’s voice thickened: “You must understand, Eragon, that slaying Galbatorix is more important than
any one person. Nothing else matters.” He paused, his gaze gentle, then added, “Given the
circumstances, is it so strange Arya was frightened that your feelings for her could endanger everything
we have worked for?”

Page 547

Eragon shook his head. He was ashamed that his behavior had caused Arya distress, and dismayed by
how reckless and juvenile he had been. I could have avoided this entire mess if I’d just kept better
control of myself.
Touching him on the shoulder, Oromis guided him back inside the hut. “Think not that I am devoid of
sympathy, Eragon. Everyone experiences ardor like yours at one point or another during their lives. It’s
part of growing up. I also know how hard it is for you to deny yourself the usual comforts of life, but it’s
necessary if we are to prevail.”
“Yes, Master.”
They sat at the kitchen table, and Oromis began to lay out writing ma-terials for Eragon to practice the
Liduen Kvaedhí. “It would be unreason-able of me to expect you to forget your fascination with Arya,
but I do expect you to prevent it from interfering with my instruction again. Can you promise me that?”
“Yes, Master. I promise.”
“And Arya? What would be the honorable thing to do about her pre-dicament?”
Eragon hesitated. “I don’t want to lose her friendship.”
“No.”
“Therefore... I will go to her, I will apologize, and I will reassure her that I never intend to cause her such
hardship again.” It was difficult for him to say, but once he did, he felt a sense of relief, as if
acknowledging his mistake cleansed him of it.
Oromis appeared pleased. “By that alone, you prove that you have ma-tured.”
The sheets of paper were smooth underneath Eragon’s hands as he pressed them flat against the
tabletop. He stared at the blank white ex-panse for a moment, then dipped a quill in ink and began to
transcribe a column of glyphs. Each barbed line was like a streak of night against the paper, an abyss into
which he could lose himself and try to forget his confused feelings.
THE OBLITERATOR

The following morn, Eragon went looking for Arya in order to apolo-gize. He searched for over an hour
without success. It seemed as if she had vanished among the many hidden nooks within Ellesméra. He
caught a glimpse of her once as he paused by the entrance to Tialdarí Hall and called out to her, but she
slipped away before he could reach her side. She’s avoiding me, he finally realized.
As the days rolled by, Eragon embraced Oromis’s training with a zeal that the elder Rider praised,
devoting himself to his studies in order to distract himself from thoughts of Arya.
Night and day, Eragon strove to master his lessons. He memorized the words of making, binding, and
summoning; learned the true names of plants and animals; and studied the perils of transmutation, how to
call upon the wind and the sea, and the myriad skills needed to understand the forces of the world. At
spells that dealt with the great energies—such as light, heat, and magnetism—he excelled, for he
possessed the talent to judge nigh exactly how much strength a task required and whether it would

exceed that of his body.
Occasionally, Orik would come and watch, standing without comment by the edge of the clearing while
Oromis tutored Eragon, or while Eragon struggled alone with a particularly difficult spell.
Oromis set many challenges before him. He had Eragon cook meals with magic, in order to teach him
finer control of his gramarye; Eragon’s first attempts resulted in a blackened mess. The elf showed
Eragon how to detect and neutralize poisons of every sort and, from then on, Eragon had to inspect his
food for the different venoms Oromis was liable to slip into it. More than once Eragon went hungry when
he could not find the poison or was unable to counteract it. Twice he became so sick, Oromis had to heal
him. And Oromis had Eragon cast multiple spells simultane-ously, which required tremendous
concentration to keep the spells di-rected at their intended targets and prevent them from shifting among
the items Eragon wanted to affect.
Oromis devoted long hours to the craft of imbuing matter with energy, either to be released at a later
time or to give an object certain attributes. He said, “This is how Rhunön charmed the Riders’ swords so
they never break or dull; how we sing plants into growing as we desire; how a trap might be set in a box,
only to be triggered when the box is opened; how we and the dwarves make the Erisdar, our lanterns;
and how you may heal one who is injured, to name but a few uses. These are the most po-tent of spells,
for they can lie dormant for a thousand years or more and are difficult to perceive or avert. They
permeate much of Alagaësia, shaping the land and the destiny of those who live here.”
Eragon asked, “You could use this technique to alter your body, couldn’t you? Or is that too
dangerous?”
Oromis’s lips quirked in a faint smile. “Alas, you have stumbled upon elves’ greatest weakness: our
vanity. We love beauty in all its forms, and we seek to represent that ideal in our appearance. That is why
we are known as the Fair Folk. Every elf looks exactly as he or she wishes to. When elves learn the
spells for growing and molding living things, they often choose to modify their appearance to better reflect
their personali-ties. A few elves have gone beyond mere aesthetic changes and altered their anatomy to
adapt to various environments, as you will see during the Blood-oath Celebration. Oftentimes, they are
more animal than elf.
“However, transferring power to a living creature is different from transferring power to an inanimate
object. Very few materials are suit-able for storing energy; most either allow it to dissipate or become so
charged with force that when you touch the object, a bolt of lightning drives through you. The best
materials we have found for this purpose are gemstones. Quartz, agates, and other lesser stones are not
as efficient as, say, a diamond, but any gem will suffice. That is why Riders’ swords always have a jewel
set in their pommels. It is also why your dwarf neck-lace—which is entirely metal—must sap your
strength to fuel its spell, since it can hold no energy of its own.”
When not with Oromis, Eragon supplemented his education by reading the many scrolls the elf gave him,
a habit he soon became addicted to. Eragon’s rearing—limited as it was by Garrow’s scant
tutelage—had ex-posed him only to the knowledge needed to run a farm. The information he discovered
on the miles of paper flooded into him like rain on parched desert, sating a previously unknown thirst. He
devoured texts on geogra-phy, biology, anatomy, philosophy, and mathematics, as well as memoirs,
biographies, and histories. More important than mere facts was his intro-duction to alternative ways of
thinking. They challenged his beliefs and forced him to reexamine his assumptions about everything from
the rights of an individual within society to what caused the sun to move across the sky.
He noticed that a number of scrolls concerned Urgals and their culture.

Eragon read them and made no mention of it, nor did Oromis broach the topic.
From his studies, Eragon learned much about the elves, a subject that he avidly pursued, hoping that it
would help him to better understand Arya. To his surprise, he discovered that the elves did not practice
mar-riage, but rather took mates for however long they wanted, whether it be for a day or a century.
Children were rare, and having a child was consid-ered by the elves to be the ultimate vow of love.
Eragon also learned that since their two races had first met, only a handful of elf-human couples had
existed: mainly human Riders who found appropriate mates among the elves. However, as best he could
tell from the cryptic records, most such relationships ended in tragedy, either because the lovers were
unable to relate to one another or because the humans aged and died while the elves escaped the ravages
of time.
In addition to nonfiction, Oromis presented Eragon with copies of the elves’ greatest songs, poems, and
epics, which captured Eragon’s imagina-tion, for the only stories he was familiar with were the ones
Brom had recited in Carvahall. He savored the epics as he might a well-cooked meal, lingering over The
Deed of Gëda or The Lay of Umhodan so as to prolong his enjoyment of the tales.
Saphira’s own training proceeded apace. Linked as he was to her mind, Eragon got to watch as Glaedr
put her through an exercise regimen every bit as strenuous as his. She practiced hovering in the air while
lifting boulders, as well as sprints, dives, and other acrobatics. To increase her endurance, Glaedr had her
breathe fire for hours upon a natural stone pil-lar in an attempt to melt it. At first Saphira could only
maintain the flames for a few minutes at a time, but before long the blistering torch roared from her maw
for over a half hour uninterrupted, heating the pil-lar white-hot. Eragon was also privy to the dragon lore
Glaedr imparted to Saphira, details about the dragons’ lives and history that comple-mented her
instinctual knowledge. Much of it was incomprehensible to Eragon, and he suspected that Saphira
concealed even more from him, secrets of her race that dragons shared with no one but themselves. One
thing he did glean, and that Saphira treasured, was the name of her sire, Iormúngr, and her dam,
Vervada, which meant Storm-cleaver in the old speech. While Iormúngr had been bound to a Rider,
Vervada was a wild dragon who had laid many eggs but entrusted only one to the Riders: Saphira. Both
dragons perished in the Fall.
Some days Eragon and Saphira would fly with Oromis and Glaedr, practicing aerial combat or visiting
crumbling ruins hidden within Du Weldenvarden. Other days they would reverse the usual order of things,
and Eragon would accompany Glaedr while Saphira remained on the Crags of Tel’naeír with Oromis.
Each morning Eragon sparred with Vanir, which, without exception, ignited one or more of Eragon’s
seizures. To make matters worse, the elf continued to treat Eragon with haughty condescension. He
delivered oblique slights that, on the surface, never exceeded the bounds of polite-ness, and he refused to
be drawn to anger no matter how Eragon needled him. Eragon hated him and his cool, mannered
bearing. It seemed as if Vanir was insulting him with every movement. And Vanir’s compan-ions—who,
as best Eragon could tell, were of a younger generation of elves—shared his veiled distaste for Eragon,
though they never displayed aught but respect for Saphira.
Their rivalry came to a head when, after defeating Eragon six times in a row, Vanir lowered his sword
and said, “Dead yet again, Shadeslayer. How repetitive. Do you wish to continue?” His tone indicated
that he thought it would be pointless.
“Aye,” grunted Eragon. He had already suffered an episode with his back and was in no mood to bandy
words.

Page 550

Still, when Vanir said, “Tell me, as I am curious: How did you kill Durza when you are so slow? I cannot
fathom how you managed it,” Er-agon felt compelled to reply: “I caught him by surprise.”
“Forgive me; I should have guessed trickery was involved.”
Eragon fought the impulse to grind his teeth. “If I were an elf or you a human, you would not be able to
match my blade.”
“Perhaps,” said Vanir. He assumed his ready position and, within the span of three seconds and two
blows, disarmed Eragon. “But I think not. You should not boast to a better swordsman, else he may
decide to pun-ish your temerity.”
Eragon’s temper broke then, and he reached deep within himself and into the torrent of magic. He
released the pent-up energy with one of the twelve minor words of binding, crying “Malthinae!” to chain
Vanir’s legs and arms in place and hold his jaw shut so that he could not utter a coun-terspell. The elf’s
eyes bulged with outrage.
Eragon said, “And you should not boast to one who is more skilled in magic than you.”
Vanir’s dark eyebrows met.
Without warning or a whisper of a sound, an invisible force clouted Er-agon on the chest and threw him
ten yards across the grass, where he landed upon his side, driving the wind from his lungs. The impact
dis-rupted Eragon’s control of the magic and freed Vanir.
How did he do that?
Advancing upon him, Vanir said, “Your ignorance betrays you, human. You do not know whereof you
speak. To think that you were chosen to succeed Vrael, that you were given his quarters, that you have
had the honor to serve the Mourning Sage...” He shook his head. “It sickens me that such gifts are
bestowed upon one so unworthy. You do not even un-derstand what magic is or how it works.”
Eragon’s anger resurged like a crimson tide. “What,” he said, “have I ever done to wrong you? Why do
you despise me so? Would you prefer it if no Rider existed to oppose Galbatorix?”
“My opinions are of little consequence.”
“I agree, but I would hear them.”
“Listening, as Nuala wrote in Convocations, is the path to wisdom only when the result of a conscious
decision and not a void of perception.”
“Straighten your tongue, Vanir, and give me an honest answer!”
Vanir smiled coldly. “As you command, O Rider.” Drawing near so that only Eragon could hear his soft
voice, the elf said, “For eighty years after the fall of the Riders, we held no hope of victory. We survived
by hiding ourselves through deceit and magic, which is but a temporary measure, for eventually
Galbatorix will be strong enough to march upon us and sweep aside our defenses. Then, long after we
had resigned ourselves to our fate, Brom and Jeod rescued Saphira’s egg, and once again a chance
existed to defeat the foul usurper. Imagine our joy and celebration. We knew that in order to withstand

Page 551

Galbatorix, the new Rider had to be more powerful than any of his predecessors, more powerful than
even Vrael. Yet how was our patience rewarded? With another human like Galbatorix. Worse... a
cripple. You doomed us all, Eragon, the instant you touched Saphira’s egg. Do not expect us to welcome
your presence.” Vanir touched his lips with his first and second finger, then sidestepped Eragon and
walked off the sparring field, leaving Eragon rooted in place.
He’s right,thought Eragon. I’m ill suited for this task. Any of these elves, even Vanir, would make a
better Rider than me.
Emanating outrage, Saphira broadened the contact between them. Do you think so little of my
judgment, Eragon? You forget that when I was in my egg, Arya exposed me to each and every one
of these elves—as well as many of the Varden’s children—and that I rejected them all. I wouldn’t
have chosen someone to be my Rider unless they could help your race, mine, and the elves, for the
three of us share an intertwined fate. You were the right person, at the right place, at the right
time. Never forget that.
If ever that were true,he said, it was before Durza injured me. Now I see naught but darkness and
evil in our future. I won’t give up, but I despair that we may not prevail. Perhaps our task is not
to overthrow Galbatorix but to prepare the way for the next Rider chosen by the remaining eggs.
At the Crags of Tel’naeír, Eragon found Oromis at the table in his hut, painting a landscape with black
ink along the bottom edge of a scroll he had finished writing.
Eragon bowed and knelt. “Master.”
Fifteen minutes elapsed before Oromis finished limning the tufts of needles on a gnarled juniper tree, laid
aside his ink, cleaned his sable brush with water from a clay pot, and then addressed Eragon, saying,
“Why have you come so early?”
“I apologize for disturbing you, but Vanir abandoned our contest part-way through and I did not know
what to do with myself.”
“Why did Vanir leave, Eragon-vodhr?”
Oromis folded his hands in his lap while Eragon described the encoun-ter, ending with: “I should not
have lost control, but I did, and I looked all the more foolish because of it. I have failed you, Master.”
“You have,” agreed Oromis. “Vanir may have goaded you, but that was no reason to respond in kind.
You must keep a better hold over your emotions, Eragon. It could cost you your life if you allow your
temper to sway your judgment during battle. Also, such childish displays do nothing but vindicate those
elves who are opposed to you. Our machinations are subtle and allow little room for such errors.”
“I am sorry, Master. It won’t happen again.”
As Oromis seemed content to wait in his chair until the time when they normally performed the Rimgar,
Eragon seized the opportunity to ask, “How could Vanir have worked magic without speaking?”
“Did he? Perhaps another elf decided to assist him.”
Eragon shook his head. “During my first day in Ellesméra, I also saw Is-lanzadí summon a downpour of
flowers by clapping her hands, nothing more. And Vanir said that I didn’t understand how magic works.

Page 552

What did he mean?”
“Once again,” said Oromis, resigned, “you grasp at knowledge that you are not prepared for. Yet,
because of our circumstances, I cannot deny it to you. Only know this: that which you ask for was not
taught to Rid-ers—and is not taught to our magicians—until they had, and have, mas-tered every other
aspect of magic, for this is the secret to the true nature of magic and the ancient language. Those who
know it may acquire great power, yes, but at a terrible risk.” He paused for a moment. “How is the
ancient language bound to magic, Eragon-vodhr?”
“The words of the ancient language can release the energy stored within your body and thus activate a
spell.”
“Ah. Then you mean that certain sounds, certain vibrations in the air, somehow tap into this energy?
Sounds that might be produced at random by any creature or thing?”
“Yes, Master.”
“Does not that seem absurd?”
Confused, Eragon said, “It doesn’t matter if it seems absurd, Master; it just is. Should I think it absurd
that the moon wanes and waxes, or that the seasons turn, or that birds fly south in the winter?”
“Of course not. But how could mere sound do so much? Can particular patterns of pitch and volume
really trigger reactions that allow us to ma-nipulate energy?”
“But they do.”
“Sound has no control over magic. Saying a word or phrase in this lan-guage is not what’s important,
it’s thinking them in this language.” With a flick of his wrist, a golden flame appeared over Oromis’s
palm, then dis-appeared. “However, unless the need is dire, we still utter our spells out loud to prevent
stray thoughts from disrupting them, which is a danger to even the most experienced magic user.”
The implications staggered Eragon. He thought back to when he almost drowned under the waterfall of
the lake Kóstha-mérna and how he had been unable to access magic because of the water surrounding
him. If I had known this then, I could have saved myself, he thought. “Master,” he said, “if sound
does not affect magic, why, then, do thoughts?”
Now Oromis smiled. “Why indeed? I must point out that we ourselves are not the source of magic.
Magic can exist on its own, independent of any spell, such as the werelights in the bogs by Aroughs, the
dream well in Mani’s Caves in the Beor Mountains, and the floating crystal on Eoam. Wild magic such as
this is treacherous, unpredictable, and often stronger than any we can cast.
“Eons ago, all magic was thus. To use it required nothing but the ability to sense magic with your
mind—which every magician must possess— and the desire and strength to use it. Without the structure
of the ancient language, magicians could not govern their talent and, as a result, loosed many evils upon
the land, killing thousands. Over time they discovered that stating their intentions in their language helped
them to order their thoughts and avoid costly errors. But it was no foolproof method. Even-tually, an
accident occurred so horrific that it almost destroyed every liv-ing being in the world. We know of the
event from fragments of manu-scripts that survived the era, but who or what cast the fatal spell is hid-den
from us. The manuscripts say that, afterward, a race called the Grey Folk—not elves, for we were young
then—gathered their resources and wrought an enchantment, perhaps the greatest that was or ever shall

Page 553

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

be. Together the Grey Folk changed the nature of magic itself. They made it so that their language, the
ancient language, could control what a spell does... could actually limit the magic so that if you said burn
that door and by chance looked at me and thought of me, the magic would still burn the door, not me.
And they gave the ancient language its two unique traits, the ability to prevent those who speak it from
lying and the ability to describe the true nature of things. How they did this remains a mys-tery.
“The manuscripts differ on what happened to the Grey Folk when they completed their work, but it
seems that the enchantment drained them of their power and left them but a shadow of themselves. They
faded away, choosing to live in their cities until the stones crumbled to dust or to take mates among the
younger races and so pass into darkness.”
“Then,” said Eragon, “it is still possible to use magic without the ancient language?”
“How do you think Saphira breathes fire? And, by your own account, she used no word when she
turned Brom’s tomb to diamond nor when she blessed the child in Farthen Dûr. Dragons’ minds are
different from ours; they need no protection from magic. They cannot use it con-sciously, aside from their
fire, but when the gift touches them, their strength is unparalleled.... You look troubled, Eragon. Why?”
Eragon stared down at his hands. “What does this mean for me, Mas-ter?”
“It means that you will continue to study the ancient language, for you can accomplish much with it that
would be too complex or too danger-ous otherwise. It means that if you are captured and gagged, you
can still call upon magic to free yourself, as Vanir did. It means that if you are captured and drugged and
cannot recall the ancient language, yes, even then, you may cast a spell, though only in the gravest
circumstances. And it means that if you would cast a spell for that which has no name in the ancient
language, you can.” He paused. “But beware the temptation to use these powers. Even the wisest among
us hesitate to trifle with them for fear of death or worse.”
The next morning, and every morning thereafter so long as he stayed in Ellesméra, Eragon dueled with
Vanir, but he never lost his temper again, no matter what the elf did or said.
Nor did Eragon feel like devoting energy to their rivalry. His back pained him more and more frequently,
driving him to the limits of his endurance. The debilitating attacks sensitized him; actions that previously
had caused him no trouble could now leave him writhing on the ground. Even the Rimgar began to trigger
the seizures as he advanced to more strenuous poses. It was not uncommon for him to suffer three or
four such episodes in one day.
Eragon’s face grew haggard. He walked with a shuffle, his movements slow and careful as he tried to
preserve his strength. It became hard for him to think clearly or to pay attention to Oromis’s lessons, and
gaps be-gan to appear in his memory that he could not account for. In his spare time, he took up Orik’s
puzzle ring again, preferring to concentrate upon the baffling interlocked rings rather than his condition.
When she was with him, Saphira insisted that he ride upon her back and did everything that she could to
make him comfortable and to save him effort.
One morning, as he clung to a spike on her neck, Eragon said, I have a new name for pain.
What’s that?
The Obliterator. Because when you’re in pain, nothing else can exist. Not thought. Not emotion. Only
the drive to escape the pain. When it’s strong enough, the Obliterator strips us of everything that makes
us who we are, until we’re reduced to creatures less than animals, creatures with a single desire and goal:

Page 554

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

escape.
A good name, then.
I’m falling apart, Saphira, like an old horse that’s plowed too many fields. Keep hold of me with your
mind, or I may drift apart and forget who I am.
I will never let go of you.
Soon afterward, Eragon fell victim to three bouts of agony while fight-ing Vanir and then two more
during the Rimgar. As he uncurled from the clenched ball he had rolled into, Oromis said, “Again,
Eragon. You must perfect your balance.”
Eragon shook his head and growled in an undertone, “No.” He crossed his arms to hide his tremors.
“What?”
“No.”
“Get up, Eragon, and try again.”
“No! Do the pose yourself; I won’t.”
Oromis knelt beside Eragon and placed a cool hand on his cheek. Holding it there, he gazed at Eragon
with such kindness, Eragon understood the depth of the elf’s compassion for him, and that, if it were
possible, Oromis would willingly assume Eragon’s pain to relieve his suffering. “Don’t abandon hope,”
said Oromis. “Never that.” A measure of strength seemed to flow from him to Eragon. “We are the
Riders. We stand be-tween the light and the dark, and keep the balance between the two. Ig-norance,
fear, hate: these are our enemies. Deny them with all your might, Eragon, or we will surely fail.” He stood
and extended a hand to-ward Eragon. “Now rise, Shadeslayer, and prove you can conquer the in-stincts
of your flesh!”
Eragon took a deep breath and pushed himself upright on one arm, wincing from the effort. He got his
feet underneath himself, paused for a moment, then straightened to his full height and looked Oromis in
the eye.
The elf nodded with approval.
Eragon remained silent until they finished the Rimgar and went to bathe in the stream, whereupon he
said, “Master.”
“Yes, Eragon?”
“Why must I endure this torture? You could use magic to give me the skills I need, to shape my body as
you do the trees and plants.”
“I could, but if I did, you would not understand how you got the body you had, your own abilities, nor
how to maintain them. No shortcuts ex-ist for the path you walk, Eragon.”
Cold water rushed over the length of Eragon’s body as he lowered him-self into the stream. He ducked
his head under the surface, holding a rock so that he would not float away, and lay stretched out along

the stream-bed, feeling like an arrow flying through the water.
NARDA

Roran leaned on one knee and scratched his new beard as he looked down at Narda.
The small town was dark and compact, like a crust of rye bread tamped into a crevasse along the coast.
Beyond it, the wine-red sea glim-mered with the last rays of the dying sunset. The water fascinated him; it
was utterly different from the landscape he was accustomed to.
We made it.
Leaving the promontory, Roran walked back to his makeshift tent, en-joying deep breaths of the salty
air. They had camped high in the foothills of the Spine in order to avoid detection by anyone who might
alert the Empire as to their whereabouts.
As he strode among the clumps of villagers huddled beneath the trees, Roran surveyed their condition
with sorrow and anger. The trek from Palancar Valley had left people sick, battered, and exhausted; their
faces gaunt from lack of food; their clothes tattered. Most everyone wore rags tied around their hands to
ward off frostbite during the frigid mountain nights. Weeks of carrying heavy packs had bowed
once-proud shoulders. The worst sight was the children: thin and unnaturally still.
They deserve better,thought Roran. I’d be in the clutches of the Ra’zac right now if they hadn’t
protected me.
Numerous people approached Roran, most of whom wanted nothing more than a touch on the shoulder
or a word of comfort. Some offered him bits of food, which he refused or, when they insisted, gave to
some-one else. Those who remained at a distance watched with round, pale eyes. He knew what they
said about him, that he was mad, that spirits possessed him, that not even the Ra’zac could defeat him in
battle.
Crossing the Spine had been even harder than Roran expected. The only paths in the forest were game
trails, which were too narrow, steep, and meandering for their group. As a result, the villagers were often
forced to chop their way through the trees and underbrush, a painstaking task that everyone despised,
not least because it made it easy for the Em-pire to track them. The one advantage to the situation was
that the exer-cise restored Roran’s injured shoulder to its previous level of strength, al-though he still had
trouble lifting his arm at certain angles.
Other hardships took their toll. A sudden storm trapped them on a bare pass high above the timberline.
Three people froze in the snow: Hida, Brenna, and Nesbit, all of whom were quite old. That night was
the first time Roran was convinced that the entire village would die because they had followed him. Soon
after, a boy broke his arm in a fall, and then Southwell drowned in a glacier stream. Wolves and bears
preyed upon their livestock on a regular basis, ignoring the watchfires that the villagers lit once they were
concealed from Palancar Valley and Galbatorix’s hated soldiers. Hunger clung to them like a relentless
parasite, gnawing at their bellies, devouring their strength, and sapping their will to continue.
And yet they survived, displaying the same obstinacy and fortitude that kept their ancestors in Palancar
Valley despite famine, war, and pesti-lence. The people of Carvahall might take an age and a half to
reach a de-cision, but once they did, nothing could deter them from their course.

Page 556

Now that they had reached Narda, a sense of hope and accomplish-ment permeated the camp. No one
knew what would happen next, but the fact that they had gotten so far gave them confidence.
We won’t be safe until we leave the Empire,thought Roran. And it’s up to me to ensure that we aren’t
caught. I’ve become responsible for everyone here.... A responsibility that he had embraced
wholeheartedly because it allowed him to both protect the villagers from Galbatorix and pursue his goal
of rescuing Katrina. It’s been so long since she was captured. How can she still be alive? He
shuddered and pushed the thoughts away. True madness awaited him if he allowed himself to brood over
Katrina’s fate.
At dawn Roran, Horst, Baldor, Loring’s three sons, and Gertrude set out for Narda. They descended
from the foothills to the town’s main road, careful to stay hidden until they emerged onto the lane. Here in
the low-lands, the air seemed thick to Roran; it felt as if he were trying to breathe underwater.
Roran gripped the hammer at his belt as they approached Narda’s gate. Two soldiers guarded the
opening. They examined Roran’s group with hard eyes, lingering on their ragged clothes, then lowered
their poleaxes and barred the entrance.
“Where’d you be from?” asked the man on the right. He could not have been older than twenty-five, but
his hair was already pure white.
Swelling his chest, Horst crossed his arms and said, “Roundabouts Teirm, if it please you.”
“What brings you here?”
“Trade. We were sent by shopkeepers who want to buy goods directly from Narda, instead of through
the usual merchants.”
“That so, eh? What goods?”
When Horst faltered, Gertrude said, “Herbs and medicine on my part. The plants I’ve received from
here have either been too old or moldy and spoiled. I have to procure a fresh supply.”
“And my brothers and I,” said Darmmen, “came to bargain with your cobblers. Shoes made in the
northern style are fashionable in Dras-Leona and Urû’baen.” He grimaced. “At least they were when we
set out.”
Horst nodded with renewed confidence. “Aye. And I’m here to collect a shipment of ironwork for my
master.”
“So you say. What about that one? What does he do?” asked the soldier, motioning toward Roran with
his ax.
“Pottery,” said Roran.
“Pottery?”
“Pottery.”
“Why the hammer, then?”

Page 557

“How do you think the glaze on a bottle or jar gets cracked? It doesn’t happen by itself, you know. You
have to hit it.” Roran returned the white-haired man’s stare of disbelief with a blank expression, daring
him to challenge the statement.
The soldier grunted and ran his gaze over them again. “Be as that may, you don’t look like tradesmen to
me. Starved alley cats is more like it.”
“We had difficulty on the road,” said Gertrude.
“That I’d believe. If you came from Teirm, where be your horses?”
“We left them at our camp,” supplied Hamund. He pointed south, op-posite where the rest of the
villagers were actually hidden.
“Don’t have the coin to stay in town, eh?” With a scornful chuckle, the soldier raised his ax and gestured
for his companion to do likewise. “All right, you can pass, but don’t cause trouble or you’ll be off to the
stocks or worse.”
Once through the gate, Horst pulled Roran to the side of the street and growled in his ear, “That was a
fool thing to do, making up something as ridiculous as that. Cracking the glaze! Do you want a fight? We
can’t—” He stopped as Gertrude plucked at his sleeve.
“Look,” murmured the healer.
To the left of the entrance stood a six-foot-wide message board with a narrow shingle roof to protect
the yellowing parchment underneath. Half the board was devoted to official notices and proclamations.
On the other half hung a block of posters displaying sketches of various crimi-nals. Foremost among
them was a drawing of Roran without a beard.
Startled, Roran glanced around to make sure that no one in the street was close enough to compare his
face to the illustration, then devoted his attention to the poster. He had expected the Empire to pursue
them, but it was still a shock to encounter proof of it. Galbatorix must be expending an enormous
amount of resources trying to catch us. When they were in the Spine, it was easy to forget that the
outside world existed. I bet post-ers of me are nailed up throughout the Empire. He grinned, glad
that he had stopped shaving and that he and the others had agreed to use false names while in Narda.
A reward was inked at the bottom of the poster. Garrow never taught Roran and Eragon to read, but he
did teach them their figures because, as he said, “You have to know how much you own, what it’s worth,
and what you’re paid for it so you don’t get rooked by some two-faced knave.” Thus, Roran could see
that the Empire had offered ten thousand crowns for him, enough to live in comfort for several decades.
In a per-verse way, the size of the reward pleased him, giving him a sense of im-portance.
Then his gaze drifted to the next poster in line.
It was Eragon.
Roran’s gut clenched as if he had been struck, and for a few seconds he forgot to breathe.
He’s alive!

After his initial relief subsided, Roran felt his old anger about Eragon’s role in Garrow’s death and the
destruction of their farm take its place, accompanied by a burning desire to know why the Empire was
hunting Eragon. It must have something to do with that blue stone and the Ra’zac’s first visit to
Carvahall. Once again, Roran wondered what kind of fiend-ish machinations he and the rest of
Carvahall had become entangled in.
Instead of a reward, Eragon’s poster bore two lines of runes. “What crime is he accused of?” Roran
asked Gertrude.
The skin around Gertrude’s eyes wrinkled as she squinted at the board. “Treason, the both of you. It
says Galbatorix will bestow an earldom on whoever captures Eragon, but that those who try should take
care be-cause he’s extremely dangerous.”
Roran blinked with astonishment. Eragon? It seemed inconceivable un-til Roran considered how he
himself had changed in the past few weeks. The same blood runs in our veins. Who knows, Eragon
may have accom-plished as much or more than I have since he left.
In a low voice, Baldor said, “If killing Galbatorix’s men and defying the Ra’zac only earns you ten
thousand crowns—large as that is—what makes you worth an earldom?”
“Buggering the king himself,” suggested Larne.
“That’s enough of that,” said Horst. “Guard your tongue better, Baldor, or we’ll end up in irons. And,
Roran, don’t draw attention to yourself again. With a reward like that, people are bound to be watching
strangers for anyone who matches your description.” Running a hand through his hair, Horst pulled up his
belt and said, “Right. We all have jobs to do. Re-turn here at noon to report on your progress.”
With that their party split into three. Darmmen, Larne, and Hamund set out together to purchase food for
the villagers, both to meet present needs and to sustain them through the next stage of their journey.
Gertrude—as she had told the guard—went to replenish her stock of herbs, unguents, and tinctures. And
Roran, Horst, and Baldor headed down the sloping streets to the docks, where they hoped to charter a
ship that could transport the villagers to Surda or, at the very least, Teirm.
When they reached the weathered boardwalk that covered the beach, Roran halted and stared out at
the ocean, which was gray from low clouds and dotted with whitecaps from erratic wind. He had never
imag-ined that the horizon could be so perfectly flat. The hollow boom of wa-ter knocking against the
piles beneath his feet made it feel as if he stood upon the surface of a huge drum. The odor of fish—fresh,
gutted, and rotting—overwhelmed every other smell.
Glancing from Roran to Baldor, who was likewise entranced, Horst said, “Quite a sight, isn’t it?”
“Aye,” said Roran.
“Makes you feel rather small, doesn’t it?”
“Aye,” said Baldor.
Horst nodded. “I remember when I first saw the ocean, it had a similar effect on me.”
“When was that?” asked Roran. In addition to the flocks of seagulls whirling over the cove, he noticed
an odd type of bird perched upon the piers. The animal had an ungainly body with a striped beak that it

Page 559

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

kept tucked against its breast like a pompous old man, a white head and neck, and a sooty torso. One of
the birds lifted its beak, revealing a leathery pouch underneath.
“Bartram, the smith who came before me,” said Horst, “died when I was fifteen, a year before the end
of my apprenticeship. I had to find a smith who was willing to finish another man’s work, so I traveled to
Ceunon, which is built along the North Sea. There I met Kelton, a vile old man but good at what he did.
He agreed to teach me.” Horst laughed. “By the time we were done, I wasn’t sure if I should thank him
or curse him.”
“Thank him, I should think,” said Baldor. “You never would have mar-ried Mother otherwise.”
Roran scowled as he studied the waterfront. “There aren’t many ships,” he observed. Two craft were
berthed at the south end of the port and a third at the opposite side with nothing but fishing boats and
dinghies in between. Of the southern pair, one had a broken mast. Roran had no experience with ships
but, to him, none of the vessels appeared large enough to carry almost three hundred passengers.
Going from one ship to the next, Roran, Horst, and Baldor soon discov-ered that they were all
otherwise engaged. It would take a month or more to repair the ship with the broken mast. The vessel
beside it, the Waverunner, was rigged with leather sails and was about to venture north to the
treacherous islands where the Seithr plant grew. And the Alba-tross, the last ship, had just arrived from
distant Feinster and was getting its seams recaulked before departing with its cargo of wool.
A dockworker laughed at Horst’s questions. “You’re too late and too early at the same time. Most of
the spring ships came and left two, three weeks ago. An’ another month, the nor’westers will start
gusting, an’ then the seal and walrus hunters will return and we’ll get ships from Teirm and the rest of the
Empire to take the hides, meat, and oil. Then you might have a chance of hiring a captain with an empty
hold. Meanwhile, we don’t see much more traffic than this.”
Desperate, Roran asked, “Is there no other way to get goods from here to Teirm? It doesn’t have to be
fast or comfortable.”
“Well,” said the man, hefting the box on his shoulder, “if it doesn’t have to be fast an’ you’re only going
to Teirm, then you might try Clovis over there.” He pointed to a line of sheds that floated between two
piers where boats could be stored. “He owns some barges that he ships grain on in the fall. The rest of
the year, Clovis fishes for a living, like most everybody in Narda.” Then he frowned. “What kind of
goods do you have? The sheep have already been shorn, an’ no crops are in as of yet.”
“This and that,” said Horst. He tossed the man a copper.
The dockworker pocketed it with a wink and a nudge. “Right you are, sir. This an’ that. I know a dodge
when I see one. But no need to fear old Ulric; mum’s th’ word, it is. Be seeing you, then, sir.” He strolled
off, whistling.
As it turned out, Clovis was absent from the docks. After getting direc-tions, it took them a half hour to
walk to his house on the other side of Narda, where they found Clovis planting iris bulbs along the path
to his front door. He was a stout man with sunburned cheeks and a salt-and-pepper beard. An additional
hour passed before they could convince the mariner that they really were interested in his barges, despite
the season, and then troop back to the sheds, which he unlocked to reveal three
identical barges, the Merrybell, Edeline, and Red Boar.

Page 560

Each barge was seventy-five feet long, twenty feet wide, and painted rust red. They had open holds that
could be covered with tarpaulins, a mast that could be erected in the center for a single square sail, and a
block of above-decks cabins at the rear—or aft, as Clovis called it—of the craft.
“Their draft be deeper than that of an inland scow,” explained Clovis, “so you needn’t fear them
capsizing in rough weather, though you’d do well to avoid being caught in a real tempest. These barges
aren’t meant for the open sea. They’re meant to stay within sight of land. And now be the worst time to
launch them. By my honor, we’ve had nothing but thunderstorms every afternoon for a month.”
“Do you have crews for all three?” asked Roran.
“Well now... see, there’s a problem. Most of the men I employ left weeks ago to hunt seals, as they’re
wont to do. Since I need them only after the harvest, they’re free to come and go as they please for the
rest of the year.... I’m sure you fine gentlemen understand my position.” Clovis tried to smile, then
glanced between Roran, Horst, and Baldor as if uncer-tain whom to address.
Roran walked the length of the Edeline, examining it for damage. The barge looked old, but the wood
was sound and the paint was fresh. “If we replace the missing men in your crews, how much would it
cost to go to Teirm with all three barges?”
“That depends,” said Clovis. “The sailors earn fifteen coppers per day, plus as much good food as they
can eat and a dram of whisky besides. What your men earn be your own business. I won’t put them on
my pay-roll. Normally, we also hire guards for each barge, but they’re—”
“They’re off hunting, yes,” said Roran. “We’ll provide guards as well.”
The knob in Clovis’s tanned throat jumped as he swallowed. “That’d be more than reasonable... so it
would. In addition to the crew’s wages, I charge a fee of two hundred crowns, plus recompense for any
damage to the barges on account of your men, plus—as both owner and captain— twelve percent of the
total profit from sale of the cargo.”
“Our trip will have no profit.”
That, more than anything, seemed to unnerve Clovis. He rubbed the dimple in his chin with his left
thumb, began to talk twice, stopped, then finally said, “If that be the case, another four hundred crowns
upon com-pletion of the voyage. What—if I may make so bold as to inquire—do you wish to
transport?”
We frighten him,thought Roran. “Livestock.”
“Be it sheep, cattle, horses, goats, oxen... ?”
“Our herds contain an assortment of animals.”
“And why do you want to take them to Teirm?”
“We have our reasons.” Roran almost smiled at Clovis’s confusion. “Would you consider sailing past
Teirm?”
“No! Teirm’s my limit, it is. I don’t know the waters beyond, nor would I want to be gone any longer
from my wife and daughter.”

Page 561

“When could you be ready?”
Clovis hesitated and executed two little steps. “Mayhap five or six days. No... no, you’d better make it a
week; I have affairs that I must attend to before departing.”
“We’d pay an additional ten crowns to leave day after tomorrow.”
“I don’t—”
“Twelve crowns.”
“Day after tomorrow it is,” vowed Clovis. “One way or another, I’ll be ready by then.”
Trailing his hand along the barge’s gunwale, Roran nodded without looking back at Clovis and said,
“May I have a minute alone to confer with my associates?”
“As you wish, sir. I’ll just go for a turn about the docks until you’re done.” Clovis hurried to the door.
Just as he exited the shed, he asked, “I’m sorry, but what’d be your name again? I fear I missed it earlier,
an’ my memory can be something dreadful.”
“Stronghammer. My name is Stronghammer.”
“Ah, of course. A good name, that.”
When the door closed, Horst and Baldor converged on Roran. Baldor said, “We can’t afford to hire
him.”
“We can’t afford not to,” replied Roran. “We don’t have the gold to buy the barges, nor do I fancy
teaching myself to handle them when every-one’s lives depend on it. It’ll be faster and safer to pay for a
crew.”
“It’s still too expensive,” said Horst.
Roran drummed his fingers against the gunwale. “We can pay Clovis’s initial fee of two hundred crowns.
Once we reach Teirm, though, I sug-gest that we either steal the barges using the skills we learn during
the trip or incapacitate Clovis and his men until we can escape through other means. That way, we avoid
paying the extra four hundred crowns, as well as the sailors’ wages.”
“I don’t like cheating a man out of honest work,” said Horst. “It goes against my fiber.”
“I don’t like it either, but can you think of an alternative?”
“How would you get everyone onto the barges?”
“Have them meet Clovis a league or so down the coast, out of sight of Narda.”
Horst sighed. “Very well, we’ll do it, but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Call Clovis back in, Baldor,
and we’ll seal this pact.”
That evening, the villagers gathered around a small banked fire in order to hear what had transpired in

Page 562

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Narda. From where he knelt on the ground, Roran stared at the pulsing coals while he listened to
Gertrude and the three brothers describe their separate adventures. The news about Roran’s and
Eragon’s posters caused murmurs of unease among the audience.
When Darmmen finished, Horst took his place and, with short, brisk sentences, related the lack of
proper ships in Narda, how the dockworker recommended Clovis, and the deal that was brokered
thereafter. How-ever, the moment Horst mentioned the word barges, the villagers’ cries of ire and
discontent blotted out his voice.
Marching to the forefront of the group, Loring raised his arms for atten-tion. “Barges?” said the cobbler.
“Barges? We don’t want no stinking barges!” He spat by his foot as people clamored with agreement.
“Everyone, be quiet!” said Delwin. “We’ll be heard if we keep this up.” When the crackling fire was the
loudest noise, he continued at a slower pace: “I agree with Loring. Barges are unacceptable. They’re
slow and vul-nerable. And we’d be crammed together with a complete lack of privacy and no shelter to
speak of for who knows how long. Horst, Elain is six months pregnant. You can’t expect her and others
who are sick and in-firm to sit under the blazing sun for weeks on end.”
“We can lash tarpaulins over the holds,” replied Horst. “It’s not much, but it’ll shield us from the sun and
the rain.”
Birgit’s voice cut through the crowd’s low babble: “I have another con-cern.” People moved aside as
she walked to the fire. “What with the two hundred crowns Clovis is due and the money Darmmen and
his brothers spent, we’ve used up most of our coin. Unlike those in cities, our wealth lies not in gold but
in animals and property. Our property is gone and few animals are left. Even if we turn pirate and steal
these barges, how can we buy supplies at Teirm or passage farther south?”
“The important thing,” rumbled Horst, “is to get to Teirm in the first place. Once we’re there, then we
can worry about what to do next.... It’s possible that we may have to resort to more drastic measures.”
Loring’s bony face crumpled into a mass of wrinkles. “Drastic? What do you mean, drastic? We’ve
already done drastic. This whole venture is drastic. I don’t care what you say; I won’t use those
confounded barges, not after what we’ve gone through in the Spine. Barges are for grain and animals.
What we want is a ship with cabins and bunks where we can sleep in comfort. Why not wait another
week or so and see if a ship ar-rives that we can bargain passage on? Where’s the harm in that, eh? Or
why not—” He continued to rail for over fifteen minutes, amassing a mountain of objections before
ceding to Thane and Ridley, who built upon his arguments.
The conversation halted as Roran unfolded his legs and rose to his full height, silencing the villagers
through his presence. They waited, breath
less, hoping for another of his visionary speeches. “It’s this or walk,” he said. Then he went to bed.
THE HAMMER FALLS

The moon floated high among the stars when Roran left the makeshift tent he shared with Baldor,
padded to the edge of the camp, and replaced Albriech on watch.
“Nothing to report,” whispered Albriech, then slipped off.

Page 563

Roran strung his bow and planted three goose-feather arrows upright in the loam, within easy reach, then
wrapped himself in a blanket and curled against the rockface to his left. His position afforded him a good
view down and across the dark foothills.
As was his habit, Roran divided the landscape into quadrants, examin-ing each one for a full minute,
always alert for the flash of movement or the hint of light that might betray the approach of enemies. His
mind soon began to wander, drifting from subject to subject with the hazy logic of dreams, distracting him
from his task. He bit the inside of his cheek to force himself to concentrate. Staying awake was difficult in
such mild weather....
Roran was just glad that he had escaped drawing lots for the two watches preceding dawn, because
they gave you no opportunity to catch up on lost sleep afterward and you felt tired for the rest of the day.
A breath of wind ghosted past him, tickling his ear and making the skin on the back of his neck prickle
with an apprehension of evil. The intru-sive touch frightened Roran, obliterating everything but the
conviction that he and the rest of the villagers were in mortal danger. He quaked as if with the ague, his
heart pounded, and he had to struggle to resist the urge to break cover and flee.
What’s wrong with me?It required an effort for him to even nock an ar-row.
To the east, a shadow detached itself from the horizon. Visible only as a void among the stars, it drifted
like a torn veil across the sky until it covered the moon, where it remained, hovering. Illuminated from
be-hind, Roran could see the translucent wings of one of the Ra’zac’s mounts.
The black creature opened its beak and uttered a long, piercing shriek. Roran grimaced with pain at the
cry’s pitch and frequency. It stabbed at his eardrums, turned his blood to ice, and replaced hope and joy
with de-spair. The ululation woke the entire forest. Birds and beasts for miles around exploded into a
yammering chorus of panic, including, to Roran’s alarm, what remained of the villagers’ herds.
Staggering from tree to tree, Roran returned to the camp, whispering, “The Ra’zac are here. Be quiet
and stay where you are,” to everyone he encountered. He saw the other sentries moving among the
frightened vil-lagers, spreading the same message.
Fisk emerged from his tent with a spear in hand and roared, “Are we under attack? What’s set off those
blasted—” Roran tackled the carpenter to silence him, uttering a muffled bellow as he landed on his right
shoul-der and pained his old injury.
“Ra’zac,” Roran groaned to Fisk.
Fisk went still and in an undertone asked, “What should I do?”
“Help me to calm the animals.”
Together they picked their way through the camp to the adjacent meadow where the goats, sheep,
donkeys, and horses were bedded. The farmers who owned the bulk of the herds slept with their charges
and were already awake and working to soothe the beasts. Roran thanked his paranoia that he had
insisted on having the animals scattered along the edge of the meadow, where the trees and brush helped
to camouflage them from unfriendly eyes.
As he tried to pacify a clump of sheep, Roran glanced up at the terrible black shadow that still obscured

Page 564

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

the moon, like a giant bat. To his horror, it began to move toward their hiding place. If that creature
screams again, we’re doomed.
By the time the Ra’zac circled overhead, most of the animals had qui-eted, except for one donkey, who
insisted upon loosing a grating hee-haw. Without hesitation, Roran dropped to one knee, fit arrow to
string, and shot the ass between the ribs. His aim was true, and the animal dropped without a sound.
He was too late, though; the braying had already alerted the Ra’zac. The monster swung its head in the
direction of the clearing and descended toward it with outstretched claws, preceded by its fetid stench.
Now the time has come to see if we can slay a nightmare,thought Roran. Fisk, who was crouched
beside him in the grass, hefted his spear, prepar-ing to hurl it once the brute was in range.
Just as Roran drew his bow—in an attempt to begin and end the battle with a well-placed shaft—he was
distracted by a commotion in the for-est.
A mass of deer burst through the underbrush and stampeded across the meadow, ignoring villagers and
livestock alike in their frantic desire to escape the Ra’zac. For almost a minute, the deer bounded past
Roran, mincing the loam with their sharp hooves and catching the moonlight with their white-rimmed
eyes. They came so close, he heard the soft gasps of their labored breathing.
The multitude of deer must have hidden the villagers because, after one last circuit over the meadow, the
winged monster turned to the south and glided farther down the Spine, melding into the night.
Roran and his companions remained frozen in place, like hunted rab-bits, afraid that the Ra’zac’s
departure might be a ruse to flush them into the open or that the creature’s twin might be close behind.
They waited for hours, tense and anxious, barely moving except to string a bow.
When the moon was about to set, the Ra’zac’s bone-chilling shriek echoed far in the distance... then
nothing.
We were lucky,decided Roran when he woke the next morning. And we can’t count on luck to save
us the next time.
After the Ra’zac’s appearance, none of the villagers objected to travel-ing by barge. On the contrary,
they were so eager to be off, many of them asked Roran if it was possible to set sail that day instead of
the next.
“I wish we could,” he said, “but too much has to be done.”
Forgoing breakfast, he, Horst, and a group of other men hiked into Narda. Roran knew that he risked
being recognized by accompanying them, but their mission was too important for him to neglect. Besides,
he was confident that his current appearance was different enough from his portrait on the Empire’s
poster that no one would equate one with the other.
They had no difficulty gaining entrance, as a different set of soldiers guarded the town gate, whereupon
they went to the docks and delivered the two hundred crowns to Clovis, who was busy overseeing a
gang of men as they readied the barges for sea.
“Thank’ee, Stronghammer,” he said, tying the bag of coins to his belt. “There be nothing like yellow gold
to brighten a man’s day.” He led them to a worktable and unrolled a chart of the waters surrounding

Page 565

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Narda, complete with notations on the strength of various currents; locations of rocks, sandbars, and
other hazards; and decades’ worth of sounding meas-urements. Drawing a line with his finger from
Narda to a small cove di-rectly south of it, Clovis said, “Here’s where we’ll meet your livestock. The
tides are gentle this time o’ year, but we still don’t want to fight them an’ no bones about it, so we’ll have
to be on our way directly after the high tide.”
“High tide?” said Roran. “Wouldn’t it be easier to wait until low tide and let it carry us out?”
Clovis tapped his nose with a twinkle in his eye. “Aye, it would, an’ so I’ve begun many a cruise. What I
don’t want, though, is to be slung up on the beach, loading your animals, when the tide comes a-rushing
back in and pushes us farther inland. There be no danger of that this way, but we’ll have to move smart
so as we’re not left high an’ dry when the wa-ters recede. Assuming we do, the sea’ll work for us, eh?”
Roran nodded. He trusted Clovis’s experience. “And how many men will you need to fill out your
crews?”
“Well, I managed to dig up seven lads—strong, true, an’ good seamen all—who have agreed to this
venture, odd as it is. Mind you, most of the boys were at the bottom of their tankards when I cornered
them last night, drinking off the pay from their last voyage, but they’ll be sober as spinsters come morn;
that I promise you. Seeing as seven were all I could find, I’d like four more.”
“Four it is,” said Roran. “My men don’t know much about sailing, but they’re able-bodied and willing to
learn.”
Clovis grunted. “I usually take on a brace of new lads each trip anyway. So long as they follow orders,
they’ll do fine; otherwise, they’ll get a be-laying pin upsides the head, mark my words. As for guards, I’d
like to have nine—three per boat. An’ they’d better not be as green as your sail-ors, or I won’t budge
from the dock, not for all the whisky in the world.”
Roran allowed himself a grim smile. “Every man who rides with me has proved himself in battle many
times over.”
“An’ they all answer to you, eh, young Stronghammer?” said Clovis. He scratched his chin, eyeing
Gedric, Delwin, and the others who were new to Narda. “How many are with you?”
“Enough.”
“Enough, you say. I wonder.” He waved a hand. “Never you mind me; my tongue runs a league before
my own common sense, or so my father used to tell me. My first mate, Torson, is at the chandler’s now,
oversee-ing the purchase of goods and equipment. I understand you have feed for your livestock?”
“Among other things.”
“Then you’d best fetch them. We can load them into the holds once the masts are up.”
Throughout the rest of the morning and afternoon, Roran and the vil-lagers with him labored to ferry the
supplies—which Loring’s sons had procured—from the warehouse where it was stored into the sheds
with the barges.
As Roran trudged across the gangplank to the Edeline and lowered his bag of flour to the sailor waiting
in the hold, Clovis observed, “Most of this t’aint feed, Stronghammer.”

Page 566

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“No,” said Roran. “But it’s needed.” He was pleased that Clovis had the sense not to inquire further.
When the last item had been stored away, Clovis beckoned to Roran. “You might as well go. Me and
the boys will handle the rest. Just you remember to be at the docks three hours after dawn with every
man jack you promised me, or we’ll lose the tide.”
“We’ll be there.”
Back in the foothills, Roran helped Elain and the others prepare for de-parture. It did not take long, as
they were accustomed to breaking camp each morning. Then he picked twelve men to accompany him to
Narda the next day. They were all good fighters, but he asked the best, like Horst and Delwin, to remain
with the rest of the villagers in case soldiers found them or the Ra’zac returned.
Once night fell, the two groups parted. Roran crouched on a boulder and watched Horst lead the
column of people down through the foothills toward the cove where they would wait for the barges.
Orval came up beside him and crossed his arms. “Do you think they’ll be safe, Stronghammer?” Anxiety
ran through his voice like a taut bow-string.
Though he too was worried, Roran said, “I do. I’d bet you a barrel of ci-der that they’ll still be asleep
when we put ashore tomorrow. You can have the pleasure of waking up Nolla. How does that sound?”
Orval smiled at the mention of his wife and nodded, appearing reassured.
I hope I’m right.Roran remained on the boulder, hunched like a bleak gargoyle, until the dark line of
villagers vanished from his sight.
They woke an hour before sunrise, when the sky had just begun to brighten with pale green and the
damp night air numbed their fingers. Roran splashed his face with water and then outfitted himself with his
bow and quiver, his ever-present hammer, one of Fisk’s shields, and one of Horst’s spears. The others
did likewise, with the addition of swords obtained during the skirmishes in Carvahall.
Running as fast as they dared down the hummocky hills, the thirteen men soon arrived at the road to
Narda and, shortly after that, the town’s main gate. To Roran’s dismay, the same two soldiers who had
troubled them earlier stood guard by the entrance. As before, the soldiers lowered their poleaxes to
block the way.
“There be quite a bit more of you this time,” observed the white-haired man. “And not all the same ones
either. Except for you.” He focused on Roran. “I suppose you expect me to believe that the spear and
shield be for pottery as well?”
“No. We’ve been hired by Clovis to protect his barges from attack on the way to Teirm.”
“You? Mercenaries?” The soldiers burst out laughing. “You said you were tradesmen.”
“This pays better.”
The white-haired man scowled. “You lie. I tried my hand at being a gentleman of fortune once. I spent
more nights hungry than not. How large be your company of tradesmen anyway? Seven yesterday and
twelve today—thirteen counting you. It seems too large for an expedition from a bunch of shopkeepers.”
His eyes narrowed as he scrutinized Roran’s face. “You look familiar. What’d be your name, eh?”

Page 567

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“Stronghammer.”
“It wouldn’t happen to be Roran, would—”
Roran jabbed forward with his spear, catching the white-haired soldier in the throat. Scarlet blood
fountained. Releasing the spear, Roran drew his hammer and twisted round as he blocked the second
soldier’s poleax with his shield. Swinging his hammer up and around, Roran crushed the man’s helm.
He stood panting between the two corpses. Now I have killed ten.
Orval and the other men stared at Roran with shock. Unable to bear their gazes, Roran turned his back
on them and gestured at the culvert that ran beneath the road. “Hide the bodies before anyone sees,” he
or-dered, brusque and harsh. As they hurried to obey, he examined the parapet on top of the wall for
sentries. Fortunately, no one was visible there or in the street through the gate. He bent and pulled his
spear free, wiping the blade clean on a tuft of grass.
“Done,” said Mandel, clambering out of the ditch. Despite his beard, the young man appeared pale.
Roran nodded and, steeling himself, faced his band. “Listen. We will walk to the docks at a quick but
reasonable pace. We will not run. When the alarm is sounded—and someone may have heard the clash
just now—act surprised and interested but not afraid. Whatever you do, give people no reason to
suspect us. The lives of your families and friends de-pend on it. If we are attacked, your only duty is to
see the barges launched. Nothing else matters. Am I clear?”
“Aye, Stronghammer,” they answered.
“Then follow me.”
As he strode through Narda, Roran felt so tense, he feared he might snap and explode into a thousand
pieces. What have I made of myself? he wondered. He glanced from man to woman, child to man, man
to dog in an effort to identify potential enemies. Everything around him appeared unnaturally bright and
filled with detail; it seemed as if he could see the individual threads in people’s clothing.
They reached the docks without incident, whereupon Clovis said, “You be early, Stronghammer. I like
that in a man. It’ll give us the opportunity to put things nice an’ shipshape before we head out.”
“Can we leave now?” asked Roran.
“You should know better’n that. Have to wait till the tide’s finished coming in, so we do.” Clovis paused
then, taking his first good look at the thirteen of them, and said, “Why, what’d be the matter,
Stronghammer? The lot of you look as if you saw the ghost of old Galbatorix himself.”
“Nothing a few hours of sea air won’t cure,” said Roran. In his current state, he could not smile, but he
did let his features assume a more pleas-ant expression in order to reassure the captain.
With a whistle, Clovis summoned two sailors from the boats. Both men were tanned the color of
hazelnuts. “This’d be Torson, my first mate,” said Clovis, indicating the man to his right. Torson’s bare
shoulder was decorated with a coiled tattoo of a flying dragon. “He’ll be skipper of the Merrybell. And
this black dog is Flint. He’s in command of the Ede-line. While you are on board, their word is law, as is
mine on the Red Boar. You’ll answer to them and me, not Stronghammer.... Well, give me a proper aye,

Page 568

aye if you heard me.”
“Aye, aye,” said the men.
“Now, which of you be my hands and which be my men-at-arms? For the life of me, I can’t tell you
apart.”
Ignoring Clovis’s admonishment that he was their commander, not Ro-ran, the villagers looked at Roran
to see if they should obey. He nodded his approval, and they divided into two factions, which Clovis
proceeded to partition into even smaller groups as he assigned a certain number of villagers to each
barge.
For the next half hour, Roran worked alongside the sailors to finish preparing the Red Boar for
departure, ears open for the first hint of alarm. We’re going to be captured or killed if we stay much
longer, he thought, checking the height of the water against the piers. He mopped sweat from his brow.
Roran started as Clovis gripped his forearm.
Before he could stop himself, Roran pulled his hammer halfway out of his belt. The thick air clogged his
throat.
Clovis raised an eyebrow at his reaction. “I’ve been watching you, Stronghammer, and I’d be interested
to know how you won such loyalty from your men. I’ve served with more captains than I care to recall,
an’ not one commanded the level of obedience you do without raising his pipes.”
Roran could not help it; he laughed. “I’ll tell you how I did it; I saved them from slavery and from being
eaten.”
Clovis’s eyebrows rose almost to his hairline. “Did you now? There’s a story I’d like to hear.”
“No, you wouldn’t.”
After a minute, Clovis said, “No, maybe I wouldn’t at that.” He glanced overboard. “Why, I’ll be
hanged. I do believe we can be on our way. Ah, and here’s my little Galina, punctual as ever.”
The burly man sprang onto the gangplank and, from there, onto the docks, where he embraced a
dark-haired girl of perhaps thirteen and a woman who Roran guessed was her mother. Clovis ruffled the
girl’s hair and said, “Now, you’ll be good while I’m gone, won’t you, Galina?”
“Yes, Father.”
As he watched Clovis bid his family farewell, Roran thought of the two soldiers dead by the gate. They
might have had families as well. Wives and children who loved them and a home they returned to
each day... He tasted bile and had to wrench his thoughts back to the pier to avoid being sick.
On the barges, the men appeared anxious. Afraid that they might lose their nerve, Roran made a show of
walking about the deck, stretching, and doing whatever he could to seem relaxed. At last Clovis jumped
back onto the Red Boar and cried, “Cast off, me lads! It’s the briny deep for us.”
In short order, the gangplanks were pulled aboard, the mooring ropes untied, and the sails raised on the
three barges. The air rang with shouted orders and chants of heave-ho as the sailors pulled on ropes.

Page 569

Behind them, Galina and her mother remained watching as the barges drew away, still and silent, hooded
and grave.
“We’re lucky, Stronghammer,” said Clovis, clapping him on the shoul-der. “We’ve a bit o’ wind to push
us along today. We may not have to row in order to reach the cove before the tide changes, eh!”
When the Red Boar was in the middle of Narda’s bay and still ten min-utes from the freedom of the
open sea, that which Roran dreaded oc-curred: the sound of bells and trumpets floated across the water
from among the stone buildings.
“What’s that?” he asked.
“I don’t rightly know,” said Clovis. He frowned as he stared at the town, his hands planted on his hips.
“It could be a fire, but no smoke is in the air. Maybe some Urgals were discovered in the area....”
Concern grew upon his face. “Did you perchance spy anyone on the road this morning?”
Roran shook his head, not trusting himself to speak.
Flint drew alongside them and shouted from the deck of the Edeline, “Should we turn back, sir?” Roran
gripped the gunwale so hard that he drove splinters under his nails, ready to intercede but afraid to
appear too anxious.
Tearing his gaze from Narda, Clovis bellowed in return, “No. We’d miss the tide then.”
“Aye, aye, sir! But I’d give a day’s pay to find out what caused that clamor.”
“So would I,” muttered Clovis.
As the houses and buildings shrank behind them, Roran crouched at the rear port of the barge, wrapped
his arms around his knees, and leaned against the cabins. He looked at the sky, struck by its depth,
clarity, and color, then into the Red Boar ’s roiling green wake, where ribbons of sea-weed fluttered. The
pitch of the barge lulled him like the rock of a cra-dle. What a beautiful day it is, he thought, grateful he
was there to ob-serve it.
After they escaped the cove—to his relief—Roran climbed the ladder to the poop deck behind the
cabins, where Clovis stood with his hand on the tiller, guiding their course. The captain said, “Ah, there’s
something exhilarating about the first day of a voyage, before you realize how bad the food is an’ start
longing for home.”
Mindful of his need to learn what he could about the barge, Roran asked Clovis the names and functions
of various objects on board, at which point he was treated to an enthusiastic lecture on the workings of
barges, ships, and the art of sailing in general.
Two hours later, Clovis pointed at a narrow peninsula that lay before them. “The cove be on the far side
of that.” Roran straightened off the railing and craned his neck, eager to confirm that the villagers were
safe.
As the Red Boar rounded the rocky spit of land, a white beach was re-vealed at the apex of the cove,
upon which were assembled the refugees from Palancar Valley. The crowd cheered and waved as the
barges emerged from behind the rocks.

Roran relaxed.
Beside him, Clovis uttered a dreadful oath. “I knew something were amiss the moment I clapped eyes
upon you, Stronghammer. Livestock indeed. Bah! You played me like a fool, you did.”
“You wrong me,” replied Roran. “I did not lie; this is my flock and I am their shepherd. Is it not within
my right to call them ‘livestock’ if I want?”
“Call them what you will, I didn’t agree to haul people to Teirm. Why you didn’t tell me the true nature
of your cargo, I might wonder, an’ the only answer on the horizon is that whatever venture you’re
engaged in means trouble... trouble for you an’ trouble for me. I should toss the lot of you overboard an’
return to Narda.”
“But you won’t,” said Roran, deadly quiet.
“Oh? An’ why not?”
“Because I need these barges, Clovis, and I’ll do anything to keep them. Anything. Honor our bargain
and you’ll have a peaceful trip and you’ll get to see Galina again. If not...” The threat sounded worse than
it was; Roran had no intention of killing Clovis, though if he had to, he would abandon him somewhere
along the coast.
Clovis’s face reddened, but he surprised Roran by grunting and saying, “Fair enough, Stronghammer.”
Pleased with himself, Roran returned his attention to the beach.
Behind him, he heard a snick.
Acting on instinct, Roran recoiled, crouching, twisting, and covering his head with his shield. His arm
vibrated as a belaying pin broke across the shield. He lowered the shield and gazed at a dismayed
Clovis, who re-treated across the deck.
Roran shook his head, never taking his eyes off his opponent. “You can’t defeat me, Clovis. I’ll ask you
again: Will you honor our bargain? If you don’t, I’ll put you ashore, commandeer the barges, and press
your crew into service. I don’t want to ruin your livelihood, but I will if you force me.... Come now. This
can be a normal, uneventful voyage if you choose to help us. Remember, you’ve already been paid.”
Drawing himself up with great dignity, Clovis said, “If I agree, then you must do me the courtesy of
explaining why this ruse were necessary, an’ why these people are here an’ where they’re from. No
matter how much gold you offer me, I won’t assist an undertaking that contradicts my prin-ciples; no, I
won’t. Are you bandits? Or do you serve the blasted king?”
“The knowledge may place you in greater danger.”
“I insist.”
“Have you heard of Carvahall in Palancar Valley?” asked Roran.
Clovis waved a hand. “Once or twice. What of it?”
“You see it now on the beach. Galbatorix’s soldiers attacked us without provocation. We fought back

Page 571

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

and, when our position became untenable, we crossed the Spine and followed the coast to Narda.
Galbatorix has promised that every man, woman, and child from Carvahall will be killed or enslaved.
Reaching Surda is our only hope of survival.” Roran left out mention of the Ra’zac; he did not want to
frighten Clovis too badly.
The weathered seaman had gone gray. “Are you still pursued?”
“Aye, but the Empire has yet to discover us.”
“An’ are you why the alarm was sounded?”
Very softly, Roran said, “I killed two soldiers who recognized me.” The revelation startled Clovis: his
eyes widened, he stepped back, and the muscles in his forearms rippled as he clenched his fists. “Make
your choice, Clovis; the shore draws near.”
He knew he had won when the captain’s shoulders drooped and the bravado faded from his bearing.
“Ah, the plague take you, Stronghammer. I’m no friend of the king; I’ll get you to Teirm. But then I want
nothing more to do with you.”
“Will you give me your word that you won’t attempt to slip away in the night or any similar deception?”
“Aye. You have it.”
Sand and rocks grated across the bottom of the Red Boar ’s hull as the barge drove itself up onto the
beach, followed on either side by its two companions. The relentless, rhythmic surge of water dashing
itself against the land sounded like the breathing of a gigantic monster. Once the sails were furled and the
gangplanks extended, Torson and Flint both strode over to the Red Boar and accosted Clovis,
demanding to know what was going on.
“There’s been a change of plans,” said Clovis.
Roran left him to explain the situation—skirting the exact reasons why the villagers left Palancar
Valley—and jumped onto the sand, whereupon he set out to find Horst among the milling knots of
people. When he spotted the smith, Roran pulled him aside and told him about the deaths in Narda. “If
it’s discovered that I left with Clovis, they may send soldiers on horses after us. We have to get everyone
onto the barges as fast as possible.”
Horst met his eye for a long minute. “You’ve become a hard man, Ro-ran, harder than I’ll ever be.”
“I’ve had to.”
“Mind that you don’t forget who you are.”
Roran spent the next three hours moving and packing the villagers’ be-longings in the Red Boar until
Clovis expressed his satisfaction. The bun-dles had to be secured so that they would not shift
unexpectedly and in-jure someone, as well as distributed so that the barge rode level in the water, which
was no easy task as the bundles were of irregular size and density. Then the animals were coaxed on
board much to their displeas-ure—and immobilized by tethers lashed to iron rings in the hold.
Last of all came the people, who, like the rest of the cargo, had to be organized into a symmetrical
pattern within the barge to keep from cap-sizing it. Clovis, Torson, and Flint each ended up standing at

Page 572

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

the fore of their barges, shouting directions to the mass of villagers below.
What now?thought Roran as he heard an argument break out on the beach. Pushing his way to the
source of the disturbance, he saw Calitha kneeling beside her stepfather, Wayland, trying to calm the old
man.
“No! I won’t go on that beast ! You can’t make me,” cried Wayland. He thrashed his withered arms
and beat his heels in an attempt to free him-self from Calitha’s embrace. Spittle flew from his lips. “Let
me go, I say. Let me go!”
Wincing from his blows, Calitha said, “He’s been unreasonable ever since we made camp last night.”
It would have been better for all concerned if he had died in the Spine, what with the trouble he’s
caused,thought Roran. He joined Calitha, and together they managed to soothe Wayland so that he no
longer screamed and hit. As a reward for his good behavior, Calitha gave him a piece of jerky, which
occupied his entire attention. While Wayland concentrated on gumming the meat, she and Roran were
able to guide him onto the Edeline and get him settled in a deserted corner where he would not be a
nuisance.
“Move your backsides, you lubbers,” shouted Clovis. “The tide’s about to turn. Hop to, hop to.”
After a final flurry of activity, the gangplanks were withdrawn, leaving a cluster of twenty men standing
on the beach before each barge. The three groups gathered around the prows and prepared to push
them back into the water.
Roran led the effort on the Red Boar. Chanting in unison, he and his men strained against the weight of
the huge barge, the gray sand giving beneath their feet, the timbers and cables creaking, and the smell of
sweat in the air. For a moment, their efforts seemed to be in vain, then the Red Boar lurched and slid
back a foot.
“Again!” shouted Roran. Foot by foot, they advanced into the sea, until the frigid water surged about
their waists. A breaker crashed over Roran, filling his mouth with seawater, which he spat out vigorously,
disgusted by the taste of salt; it was far more intense than he expected.
When the barge lifted free of the seabed, Roran swam alongside the Red Boar and pulled himself up
with one of the ropes draped over the gunwale. Meanwhile, the sailors deployed long poles that they
used to propel the Red Boar into ever deeper water, as did the crews of the Mer-rybell and Edeline.
The instant they were a reasonable distance from shore, Clovis ordered the poles stowed away and oars
broken out, with which the sailors aimed the Red Boar ’s prow toward the cove’s entrance. They hoisted
the sail, aligned it to catch the light wind, and, at the vanguard of the trio of barges, set forth for Teirm
upon the uncertain expanse of the bounding main.
THE BEGINNING OF WISDOM

The days Eragon spent in Ellesméra blended together without distinc-tion; time seemed to have no hold
in the pinewood city. The season aged not, even as the afternoons and evenings lengthened, barring the
forest with rich shadows. Flowers of all months bloomed at the urging of the elves’ magic, nourished by
the enchantments spun through the air.

Page 573

Eragon came to love Ellesméra with its beauty and its quiet, the grace-ful buildings that flowed out of the
trees, the haunting songs that echoed at twilight, the works of art hidden within the mysterious dwellings,
and the introspection of the elves themselves, which they mixed with out-bursts of merriment.
The wild animals of Du Weldenvarden had no fear of hunters. Often Eragon would look from his eyrie to
see an elf petting a stag or a gray fox or murmuring to a shy bear that trundled along the edge of a
clearing, re-luctant to expose himself. Some animals had no recognizable form. They appeared at night,
moving and grunting in the bushes and fleeing if Er-agon dared approach. Once he glimpsed a creature
like a furred snake and once a white-robed woman whose body wavered and disappeared to re-veal a
grinning she-wolf in her place.
Eragon and Saphira continued to explore Ellesméra when they had the chance. They went alone or with
Orik, for Arya no longer accompanied them, nor had Eragon spoken to her since she broke his fairth. He
saw her now and then, flitting between the trees, but whenever he ap-proached—intending to
apologize—she withdrew, leaving him alone among the ancient pines. At last Eragon realized that he had
to take the initiative if he were to ever have a chance of mending his relationship with her. So one
evening, he picked a bouquet from the flowers along the path by his tree and hobbled to Tialdarí Hall,
where he asked directions to Arya’s quarters from an elf in the common room.
The screen door was open when he reached her chambers. No one an-swered when he knocked. He
stepped inside, listening for approaching footsteps as he glanced around the spacious vine-covered living
room, which opened to a small bedroom on one side and a study on the other. Two fairths decorated the
walls: a portrait of a stern, proud elf with sil-ver hair, who Eragon guessed was King Evandar, and that of
a younger male elf whom he did not recognize.
Eragon wandered through the apartment, looking but not touching, savoring his glimpse into Arya’s life,
gleaning what he could about her in-terests and hobbies. By her bed, he saw a glass sphere with a
preserved blossom of the black morning glory embedded within it; on her desk, neat rows of scrolls with
titles like Osilon: Harvest Report and Activity Noted by Gil’ead Watchtower; on the sill of an open
bay window, three miniature trees grown in the shape of glyphs from the ancient language, the glyphs for
peace, strength, and wisdom ; and by the trees, a scrap of paper with an unfinished poem, covered with
crossed-out words and scribbled marks. It read:
Under the moon, the bright white moon,
Lies a pool, a flat silver pool,
Among the brakes and brambles,
And black-heart pines.
Falls a stone, a living stone,
Cracks the moon, the bright white moon,
Among the brakes and brambles,
And black-heart pines.
Shards of light, swords of light,

Page 574

Ripple ’cross the pool,
The quiet mere, the still tarn,
The lonely lake there.
In the night, the dark and heavy night,
Flutter shadows, confused shadows,
Where once...
Going to the small table by the entrance, Eragon laid his bouquet upon it and turned to leave. He froze as
he saw Arya standing in the doorway. She looked startled by his presence, then concealed her emotions
behind an impassive expression.
They stared at each other in silence.
He lifted the bouquet, half offering it to her. “I don’t know how to make a blossom for you, like Fäolin
did, but these are honest flowers and the best I could find.”
“I cannot accept them, Eragon.”
“They’re not... they’re not that sort of gift.” He paused. “It’s no excuse, but I didn’t realize beforehand
that my fairth would put you in such a difficult situation. For that, I’m sorry, and I cry your pardon.... I
was just trying to make a fairth, not cause trouble. I understand the importance of my studies, Arya, and
you needn’t fear I will neglect them in order to moon after you.” He swayed and leaned against the wall,
too dizzy to re-main on his feet without support. “That’s all.”
She regarded him for a long moment, then slowly reached out and took the bouquet, which she held
beneath her nose. Her eyes never left his. “They are honest flowers,” she conceded. Her gaze flickered
down to his feet and back up again. “Have you been ill?”
“No. My back.”
“I had heard, but I did not think...”
He pushed himself away from the wall. “I should go.”
“Wait.” Arya hesitated, then guided him to the bay window, where he sat on the padded bench that
curved from the wall. Removing two gob-lets from a cupboard, Arya crumbled dried nettle leaves into
them, then filled the goblets with water and—saying “Boil”—heated the water for tea.
She gave a goblet to Eragon, who held it with both hands so the warmth seeped into him. He glanced
out the window to the ground twenty feet below, where elves walked among the royal gardens, talking
and singing, and fireflies floated through the dusky air.
“I wish...,” said Eragon, “I wish it could always be like this. It’s so perfect and quiet.”
Arya stirred her tea. “How fares Saphira?”

Page 575

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“The same. And you?”
“I have been preparing to return to the Varden.”
Alarm shot through him. “When?”
“After the Blood-oath Celebration. I have tarried here far too long as it is, but I have been loath to leave
and Islanzadí wished me to stay. Also... I have never attended a Blood-oath Celebration and it is the
most impor-tant of our observances.” She considered him over the rim of her goblet. “Is there nothing
Oromis can do for you?”
Eragon forced a weary shrug. “He tried everything he knows.”
They sipped their tea and watched the groups and couples meander along the garden paths. “Your
studies go well, though?” she asked.
“They do.” In the lull that followed, Eragon picked up the scrap of pa-per from between the trees and
examined her stanzas, as if reading them for the first time. “Do you often write poetry?”
Arya extended her hand for the paper and, when he gave it to her, rolled it into a tube so that the words
were no longer visible. “It is cus-tom that everyone who attends the Blood-oath Celebration should bring
a poem, a song, or some other piece of art that they have made and share it with those assembled. I have
but begun to work on mine.”
“I think it’s quite good.”
“If you had read much poetry—”
“I have.”
Arya paused, then dipped her head and said, “Forgive me. You are not the person I first met in
Gil’ead.”
“No. I...” He stopped and twisted the goblet between his hands while he searched for the right words.
“Arya... you’ll be leaving soon enough. I would count it a shame if this is the last I see of you between
now and then. Could we not meet occasionally, as we did before, and you could show Saphira and me
more of Ellesméra?”
“It would not be wise,” she said in a gentle but firm voice.
He looked up at her. “Must the price of my indiscretion be our friend-ship? I cannot help how I feel
toward you, but I would rather suffer an-other wound from Durza than allow my foolishness to destroy
the com-panionship that existed between us. I value it too highly.”
Lifting her goblet, Arya finished the last of her tea before responding. “Our friendship shall endure,
Eragon. As for us spending time together...” Her lips curved with a hint of a smile. “Perhaps. However,
we shall have to wait and see what the future brings, for I am busy and can promise nothing.”
He knew her words were the closest thing to a conciliation he was likely to receive, and he was grateful
for them. “Of course, Arya Svit-kona,” he said, and bowed his head.

Page 576

They exchanged a few more pleasantries, but it was clear that Arya had gone as far as she was willing to
go that day, so Eragon returned to Saphira, his hope restored by what he had accomplished. Now it’s
up to fate to decide the outcome, he thought as he settled before Oromis’s latest scroll.
Reaching into the pouch at his belt, Eragon withdrew a soapstone con-tainer of nalgask—beeswax
melted with hazelnut oil—and smeared it over his lips to protect them against the cold wind that scoured
his face. He closed the pouch, then wrapped his arms around Saphira’s neck and buried his face in the
crook of his elbow to reduce the glare from the wimpled clouds beneath them. The tireless beat of
Saphira’s wings domi-nated his hearing, higher and faster than that of Glaedr’s, whom she fol-lowed.
They flew southwest from dawn until early afternoon, often pausing for enthusiastic sparring bouts
between Saphira and Glaedr, during which Eragon had to strap his arms onto the saddle to prevent
himself from be-ing thrown off by the stomach-turning acrobatics. He then would free himself by pulling
on slipknots with his teeth.
The trip ended at a cluster of four mountains that towered over the forest, the first mountains Eragon had
seen in Du Weldenvarden. White-capped and windswept, they pierced the veil of clouds and bared their
crevassed brows to the beating sun, which was heatless at such altitude.
They look so small compared to the Beors,said Saphira.
As had become his habit during weeks of meditation, Eragon extended his mind in every direction,
touching upon the consciousnesses around him in search of any who might mean him harm. He felt a
marmot warm in her burrow, ravens, nuthatches, and hawks, numerous squirrels run-ning among the
trees, and, farther down the mountain, rock snakes undu-lating through the brush in search of the mice
that were their prey, as well as the hordes of ubiquitous insects.
When Glaedr descended to a bare ridge on the first mountain, Saphira had to wait until he folded his
massive wings before there was enough room for her to land. The field of boulder-strewn talus they
alighted upon was brilliant yellow from a coating of hard, crenulated lichen. Above them loomed a sheer
black cliff. It acted as buttress and dam for a cornice of blue ice that groaned and split under the wind,
loosing jagged slabs that shattered on the granite below.
This peak is known as Fionula,said Glaedr. And her brothers are Ethrundr, Merogoven, and
Griminsmal. Each has its own tale, which I shall recount on the flight back. But for now, I shall
address the purpose of this trip, namely the nature of the bond forged between dragons and elves
and, later, humans. You both know something of it—and I have hinted at its full implications to
Saphira—but the time has come to learn the solemn and pro-found meaning of your partnership
so that you may uphold it when Oromis and I are no more.
“Master?” asked Eragon, wrapping his cloak around himself to stay warm.
Yes, Eragon.
“Why is Oromis not here with us?”
Because,rumbled Glaedr, it is my duty—as was always the duty of an elder dragon in centuries
past—to ensure that the newest generation of Rid-ers understands the true importance of the
station they have assumed. And because Oromis is not as well as he appears.

Page 577

The rocks cracked with muffled reports as Glaedr coiled up, nestling himself among the scree and
placing his majestic head upon the ground lengthwise to Eragon and Saphira. He examined them with one
gold eye as large as a polished roundshield and twice as brilliant. A gray smudge of smoke drifted from
his nostrils and was blown to tatters by the wind.
Parts of what I am about to reveal were common knowledge among the elves, Riders, and learned
humans, but much of it was known only to the leader of the Riders, a mere handful of elves, the humans’
current potentate, and, of course, the dragons.
Listen now, my hatchlings. When peace was made between dragons and elves at the end of our war, the
Riders were created to ensure that such con-flict would never again arise between our two races. Queen
Tarmunora of the elves and the dragon who had been selected to represent us, whose name—he paused
and conveyed a series of impressions to Eragon: long tooth, white tooth, chipped tooth; fights won, fights
lost; countless eaten Shrrg and Nagra; seven-and-twenty eggs sired and nineteen offspring grown to
maturity— cannot be expressed in any language, decided that a common treaty would not suffice.
Signed paper means nothing to a dragon. Our blood runs hot and thick and, given enough time, it
was inevitable that we would clash with the elves again, as we had with the dwarves over the
millennia. But unlike with the dwarves, neither we nor the elves could af-ford another war. We
were both too powerful, and we would have destroyed each other. The one way to prevent that
and to forge a meaningful accord was to link our two races with magic.
Eragon shivered, and with a touch of amusement, Glaedr said, Saphira, if you are wise, you will heat
one of these rocks with the fire from your belly so that your Rider does not freeze.
Thereupon Saphira arched her neck, and a jet of blue flame emanated from between her serrated fangs
and splashed against the scree, blacken-ing the lichen, which released a bitter smell as it burned. The air
grew so hot that Eragon was forced to turn away. He felt the insects underneath the rocks being crisped
in the inferno. After a minute, Saphira clapped shut her jaws, leaving a circle of stones five feet across
glowing cherry red.
Thank you,Eragon said to her. He hunched by the edge of the scorched rocks and warmed his hands
over them.
Remember, Saphira, to use your tongue to direct the stream,admonished Glaedr. Now... it took nine
years for the elves’ wisest magicians to devise the needed spell. When they had, they and the
dragons gathered together at Ilirea. The elves provided the structure of the enchantment, the
dragons pro-vided the strength, and together they melded the souls of elves and dragons.
The joining changed us. We dragons gained the use of language and other trappings of civilization, while
the elves shared in our longevity, since before that moment, their lives were as short as humans’. In the
end, the elves were the most affected. Our magic, dragons’ magic—which permeates every fiber of our
being—was transmitted to the elves and, in time, gave them their much-vaunted strength and grace.
Humans have never been influenced as strongly, since you were added to the spell after its completion
and it has not had as much time to work upon you as with the elves. Still—and here Glaedr’s eye
gleamed— it has already gentled your race from the rough barbarians who first landed in
Alagaësia, though you have begun to regress since the Fall.
“Were dwarves ever part of this spell?” asked Eragon.
No, and that is why there has never been a dwarf Rider. They do not care for dragons, nor we for them,
and they found the idea of being joined with us repellent. Perhaps it is fortunate that they did not enter

into our pact, for they have escaped the decline of humans and elves.
Decline, Master?queried Saphira in what Eragon would have sworn was a teasing tone of voice.
Aye, decline. If one or another of our three races suffer, so do they all. By killing dragons, Galbatorix
harmed his own race as well as the elves. The two of you have not seen this, for you are new to
Ellesméra, but the elves are on the wane; their power is not what it once was. And humans have lost
much of their culture and been consumed by chaos and corruption. Only by righting the imbalance
between our three races shall order return to the world.
The old dragon kneaded the scree with his talons, crumbling it into gravel so that he was more
comfortable. Layered within the enchantment Queen Tarmunora oversaw was the mechanism that
allows a hatchling to be linked with his or her Rider. When a dragon decides to give an egg to the
Riders, certain words are said over the egg—which I shall teach you later— that prevent the
dragon inside from hatching until it is brought into contact with the person with whom it decides
to bond. As dragons can remain in their eggs indefinitely, time is of no concern, nor is the infant
harmed. You yourself are an example of this, Saphira.
The bond that forms between a Rider and dragon is but an enhanced ver-sion of the bond that already
exists between our races. The human or elf be-comes stronger and fairer, while some of the dragon’s
fiercer traits are tem-pered by a more reasoned outlook.... I see a thought biting at your tongue, Eragon.
What is it?
“It’s just...” He hesitated. “I have a hard time imagining you or Saphira being any fiercer. Not,” he added
anxiously, “that that’s a bad thing.”
The ground shook as if with an avalanche as Glaedr chuckled, rolling his great big staring eye behind its
horny lid and back again. If ever you met an unbonded dragon, you would not say so. A dragon
alone answers to no one and no thing, takes whatever pleases it, and bears no thought of kindness
for aught but its kith and kin. Fierce and proud were the wild dragons, even arrogant.... The
females were so formidable, it was accounted a great accomplishment among the Riders’ dragons
to mate with one.
The lack of this bond is why Galbatorix’s partnership with Shruikan, his second dragon, is such a
perverted union. Shruikan did not choose Galba-torix as his partner; he was twisted by certain black
magics into serving Galbatorix’s madness. Galbatorix has constructed a depraved imitation of the
relationship that you, Eragon, and you, Saphira, possess and that he lost when the Urgals murdered his
original dragon.
Glaedr paused and looked between the two of them. His eye was all that moved. That which links you
exceeds any simple connection between minds. Your very souls, your identities—call it what you
will—have been welded on a primal level. His eye flicked to Eragon. Do you believe that a person’s
soul is separate from his body?
“I don’t know,” said Eragon. “Saphira once took me out of my body and let me see the world through
her eyes.... It seemed like I was no longer connected to my body. And if the wraiths that a sorcerer calls
upon can exist, then maybe our consciousness is independent of flesh as well.”
Extending the needle-sharp tip of his foreclaw, Glaedr flipped over a rock to expose a woodrat
cowering in its nest. He snapped up the rat with a flash of his red tongue; Eragon winced as he felt the
animal’s life extinguished.

Page 579

When the flesh is destroyed, so is the soul,said Glaedr.
“But an animal isn’t a person,” protested Eragon.
After your meditations, do you truly believe that any of us are so different from a woodrat? That we are
gifted with a miraculous quality that other creatures do not enjoy and that somehow preserves our beings
after death?
“No,” muttered Eragon.
I thought not. Because we are so closely joined, when a dragon or Rider is injured, they must harden
their hearts and sever the connection between them in order to protect each other from unnecessary
suffering, even insan-ity. And since the soul cannot be torn from the flesh, you must resist the temptation
to try to take your partner’s soul into your own body and shelter it there, as that will result in both your
deaths. Even if it were possible, it would be an abomination to have multiple consciousnesses in one
body.
“How terrible,” said Eragon, “to die alone, separate even from the one who is closest to you.”
Everyone dies alone, Eragon. Whether you are a king on a battlefield or a lowly peasant lying in bed
among your family, no one can accompany you into the void.... Now I will have you practice separating
your conscious-nesses. Start by...
Eragon stared at the tray of dinner left in the anteroom of the tree house. He cataloged the contents:
bread with hazelnut butter, berries, beans, a bowl of leafy greens, two hard-boiled eggs—which, in
accor-dance with the elves’ beliefs, were unfertilized—and a stoppered jug of fresh spring water. He
knew that each dish was prepared with the ut-most care, that the elves lavished all of their culinary skill
upon his meals, and that not even Islanzadí ate better than him.
He could not bear the sight of the tray.
I want meat,he growled, stomping back into the bedroom. Saphira looked up at him from her dais. I’d
even settle for fish or fowl, anything besides this never-ending stream of vegetables. They don’t
fill up my stom-ach. I’m not a horse; why should I be fed like one?
Saphira unfolded her legs, walked to the edge of the teardrop gap over-looking Ellesméra, and said, I
have needed to eat these past few days. Would you like to join me? You can cook as much meat as
you like and the elves will never know.
That I would,he said, brightening. Should I get the saddle?
We won’t go that far.
Eragon fetched his supply of salt, herbs, and other seasonings from his bags and then, careful not to
overexert himself, climbed into the gap be-tween the spikes along Saphira’s spine.
Launching herself off the ground, Saphira let an updraft waft her high above the city, whereupon she
glided off the column of warm air, slip-ping down and sideways as she followed a braided stream through
Du Weldenvarden to a pond some miles thence. She landed and hunched low to the ground, making it
easier for Eragon to dismount.

She said, There are rabbits in the grass by the edge of the water. See if you can catch them. In the
meantime, I go to hunt deer.
What, you don’t want to share your own prey?
No, I don’t,she replied grumpily. Though I will if those oversized mice elude you.
He grinned as she took off, then faced the tangled clumps of grass and cow parsnip that surrounded the
pond and set about procuring his din-ner.
Less than a minute later, Eragon collected a brace of dead rabbits from their nest. It had taken him but
an instant to locate the rabbits with his mind and then kill them with one of the twelve death words. What
he had learned from Oromis had drained the challenge and excitement from the chase. I didn’t even
have to stalk them, he thought, remembering the years he had spent honing his tracking abilities. He
grimaced with sour amusement. I can finally bag any game I want and it seems meaningless to me.
At least when I hunted with a pebble with Brom, it was still a chal-lenge, but this... this is
slaughter.
The warning of the sword-shaper Rhunön returned to him then: “When you can have anything you want
by uttering a few words, the goal matters not, only the journey to it.”
I should have paid more attention to her,realized Eragon.
With practiced movements, he drew his old hunting knife, skinned and gutted the rabbits, and
then—putting aside the hearts, lungs, kidneys, and livers—buried the viscera so that the scent would not
attract scavengers. Next he dug a pit, filled it with wood, and lit a small blaze with magic, since he had
not thought to bring his flint and steel. He tended the fire until he had a bed of coals. Cutting a wand of
dogwood, he stripped the bark and seared the wood over the coals to burn off the bitter sap, then
spitted the carcasses on the wand and suspended them between two forked branches pounded into the
ground. For the organs, he placed a flat stone upon a section of the coals and greased it with fat for a
makeshift frying pan.
Saphira found him crouched by the fire, slowly turning the wand to cook the meat evenly. She landed
with a limp deer hanging from her jaws and the remains of a second deer clutched in her talons.
Measuring her length out in the fragrant grass, she proceeded to gorge upon her prey, eating the entire
deer, including the hide. Bones cracked between her ra-zor teeth, like branches snapping in a gale.
When the rabbits were ready, Eragon waved them in the air to cool them, then stared at the glistening,
golden meat, the smell of which he found almost unbearably enticing.
As he opened his mouth to take the first bite, his thoughts turned un-bidden to his meditations. He
remembered his excursions into the minds of birds and squirrels and mice, how full of energy they felt and
how vig-orously they fought for the right to exist in the face of danger. And if this life is all they have...
Gripped by revulsion, Eragon thrust the meat away, as appalled by the fact that he had killed the rabbits
as if he had murdered two people. His stomach churned and threatened to make him purge himself.
Saphira paused in her feast to eye him with concern.
Taking a long breath, Eragon pressed his fists against his knees in an at-tempt to master himself and

Page 581

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

understand why he was so strongly affected. His entire life he had eaten meat, fish, and fowl. He enjoyed
it. And yet it now made him physically ill to consider dining upon the rabbits. He looked at Saphira. I
can’t do it, he said.
It is the way of the world that everything eats everything else. Why do you resist the order of things?
He pondered her question. He did not condemn those who did partake of flesh—he knew that it was
the only means of survival for many a poor farmer. But he could no longer do so himself unless faced with
starvation. Having been inside of a rabbit and having felt what a rabbit feels... eating
one would be akin to eating himself. Because we can better ourselves, he answered Saphira. Should
we give in to our impulses to hurt or kill any who anger us, to take whatever we want from those
who are weaker, and, in gen-eral, to disregard the feelings of others? We are made imperfect and
must guard against our flaws lest they destroy us. He gestured at the rabbits. As Oromis said, why
should we cause unnecessary suffering?
Would you deny all of your desires, then?
I would deny those that are destructive.
You are adamant on this?
Aye.
In that case,said Saphira, advancing upon him, these will make a fine dessert. In a blink, she gulped
down the rabbits and then licked clean the stone with the organs, abrading the slate with the barbs on her
tongue. I, at least, cannot live on plants alone—that is food for prey, not a dragon. I refuse to be
ashamed about how I must sustain myself. Everything has its place in the world. Even a rabbit
knows that.
I’m not trying to make you feel guilty,he said, patting her on the leg. This is a personal decision. I
won’t force my choice upon anyone.
Very wise,she said with a touch of sarcasm.
BROKEN EGG AND SCATTERED NEST

“Concentrate, Eragon,” said Oromis, though not unkindly.
Eragon blinked and rubbed his eyes in an attempt to focus on the glyphs that decorated the curling
parchment paper before him. “Sorry, Master.” Weariness dragged upon him like lead weights tied to his
limbs. He squinted at the curved and spiked glyphs, raised his goose-feather quill, and began to copy
them again.
Through the window behind Oromis, the green shelf on top of the Crags of Tel’naeír was streaked with
shadows from the descending sun. Beyond, feathery clouds banded the sky.
Eragon’s hand jerked as a line of pain shot up his leg, and he broke the nib of the quill and sprayed ink
across the paper, ruining it. Across from him, Oromis also started, clutching his right arm.

Page 582

Saphira!cried Eragon. He reached for her with his mind and, to his be-wilderment, was deflected by
impenetrable barriers that she had erected around herself. He could barely feel her. It was as if he were
trying to grasp an orb of polished granite coated with oil. She kept slipping away from him.
He looked at Oromis. “Something’s happened to them, hasn’t it?”
“I know not. Glaedr returns, but he refuses to talk to me.” Taking his blade, Naegling, from the wall,
Oromis strode outside and stood upon the edge of the crags, head uplifted as he waited for the gold
dragon to ap-pear.
Eragon joined him, thinking of everything—probable and improb-able—that might have befallen
Saphira. The two dragons had left at noon, flying north to a place called the Stone of Broken Eggs,
where the wild dragons had nested in ages past. It was an easy trip. It couldn’t be Ur-gals; the elves
don’t allow them into Du Weldenvarden, he told himself.
At last Glaedr came into view high above as a winking speck among the darkening clouds. As he
descended to land, Eragon saw a wound on the back of the dragon’s right foreleg, a tear in his lapped
scales as wide as Eragon’s hand. Scarlet blood laced the grooves between the surrounding scales.
The moment Glaedr touched the ground, Oromis rushed toward him, only to stop when the dragon
growled at him. Hopping on his injured leg, Glaedr crawled to the edge of the forest, where he curled up
beneath the outstretched boughs, his back to Eragon, and set about licking clean his wound.
Oromis went and knelt in the clover by Glaedr, keeping his distance with calm patience. It was obvious
that he would wait as long as need be. Eragon fidgeted as the minutes elapsed. Finally, by some
unspoken signal, Glaedr allowed Oromis to draw near and inspect his leg. Magic glowed from Oromis’s
gedwëy ignasia as he placed his hand over the rent in Glaedr’s scales.
“How is he?” asked Eragon when Oromis withdrew.
“It looks a fearsome wound, but it is no more than a scratch for one so large as Glaedr.”
“What about Saphira, though? I still can’t contact her.”
“You must go to her,” said Oromis. “She is hurt, in more ways than one. Glaedr said little of what
transpired, but I have guessed much, and you would do well to hurry.”
Eragon glanced about for any means of transportation and groaned with anguish when he confirmed that
none existed. “How can I reach her? It’s too far to run, there’s no trail, and I can’t—”
“Calm thyself, Eragon. What was the name of the steed who bore you hence from Sílthrim?”
It took Eragon a moment to recall. “Folkvír.”
“Then summon him with your skill at gramarye. Name him and your need in this, the most powerful of
languages, and he will come to your assistance.”
Letting the magic suffuse his voice, Eragon cried out for Folkvír, send-ing his plea echoing over the
forested hills toward Ellesméra with all the urgency he could muster.

Page 583

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Oromis nodded, satisfied. “Well done.”
Twelve minutes later, Folkvír emerged like a silver ghost from the dark shadows among the trees,
tossing his mane and snorting with excitement. The stallion’s sides heaved from the speed of his journey.
Throwing a leg over the small elven horse, Eragon said, “I’ll return as soon as I can.”
“Do what you must,” said Oromis.
Then Eragon touched his heels to Folkvír’s ribs and shouted, “Run, Folkvír! Run!” The horse leaped
forward and bounded into Du Welden-varden, threading his way with incredible dexterity between the
gnarled pines. Eragon guided him toward Saphira with images from his mind.
Lacking a trail through the underbrush, a horse like Snowfire would have taken three or four hours to
reach the Stone of Broken Eggs. Folkvír managed the trip in a bit over an hour.
At the base of the basalt monolith—which ascended from the forest floor like a mottled green pillar and
stood a good hundred feet higher than the trees—Eragon murmured, “Halt,” then slid to the ground. He
looked at the distant top of the Stone of Broken Eggs. Saphira was up there.
He walked around the perimeter, searching for a means to achieve the pinnacle, but in vain, for the
weathered formation was impregnable. It possessed no fissures, crevices, or other faults near enough to
the ground that he could use to climb its sides.
This might hurt,he thought.
“Stay here,” he told Folkvír. The horse looked at him with intelligent eyes. “Graze if you want, but stay
here, okay?” Folkvír nickered and, with his velvet muzzle, nudged Eragon’s arm. “Yes, good boy.
You’ve done well.”
Fixing his gaze on the crest of the monolith, Eragon gathered his strength, then said in the ancient
language, “Up!”
He realized later that if he had not been accustomed to flying with Saphira, the experience might have
proved unsettling enough to cause him to lose control of the spell and plunge to his death. The ground
dropped away beneath his feet at a swift clip, while the tree trunks nar-rowed as he floated toward the
underside of the canopy and the fading evening sky beyond. Branches clung like grasping fingers to his
face and shoulders as he pushed through into the open. Unlike during one of Saphira’s dives, he retained
his sense of weight, as if he still stood upon the loam below.
Rising above the edge of the Stone of Broken Eggs, Eragon moved him-self forward and released his
grip on the magic, alighting upon a mossy patch. He sagged with exhaustion and waited to see if the
exertion would pain his back, then sighed with relief when it did not.
The top of the monolith was composed of jagged towers divided by deep and wide gullies where naught
but a few scattered wildflowers grew. Black caves dotted the towers, some natural, others clawed out of
the basalt by talons as thick as Eragon’s leg. Their floors were blanketed with a deep layer of
lichen-ridden bones, remnants of the dragons’ an-cient kills. Birds now nested where dragons once
had—hawks and falcons and eagles, who watched him from their perches, ready to attack if he should
threaten their eggs.

Page 584

Eragon picked his way across the forbidding landscape, careful not to twist an ankle on the loose flakes
of stone or to get too close to the occa-sional rifts that split the column. If he fell down one, it would send
him tumbling out into empty space. Several times he had to climb over high ridges, and twice more he
had to lift himself with magic.
Evidence of the dragons’ habitation was visible everywhere, from deep scratches in the basalt to puddles
of melted rock to a number of dull, colorless scales caught in nooks, along with other detritus. He even
stepped upon a sharp object that, when he bent to examine it, proved to be a fragment of a green dragon
egg.
On the eastern face of the monolith stood the tallest tower, in the cen-ter of which, like a black pit turned
on its side, was the largest cave. It was there that Eragon finally beheld Saphira, curled in a hollow
against the far wall, her back to the opening. Tremors ran her length. The walls of the cave bore fresh
scorch marks, and the piles of brittle bones were scattered about as if from a fight.
“Saphira,” said Eragon, speaking out loud since her mind was closed to him.
Her head whipped up, and she stared at him as if he were a stranger, her pupils contracting to thin black
slits as her eyes adjusted to the light from the setting sun behind him. She snarled once, like a feral dog,
and then twisted away. As she did, she lifted her left wing and exposed a long, ragged gash along her
upper thigh. His heart caught at the sight.
Eragon knew that she would not let him approach, so he did as Oromis had with Glaedr; he knelt among
the crushed bones and waited. He waited without word or motion until his legs were numb and his hands
were stiff with cold. Yet he did not resent the discomfort. He paid the price gladly if it meant he could
help Saphira.
After a time, she said, I have been a fool.
We are all fools sometimes.
That makes it no easier when it is your turn to play dunce.
I suppose not.
I have always known what to do. When Garrow died, I knew it was the right thing to pursue the Ra’zac.
When Brom died, I knew that we should go to Gil’ead and thence to the Varden. And when Ajihad
died, I knew that you should pledge yourself to Nasuada. The path has always been clear to me. Except
now. In this issue alone, I am lost.
What is it, Saphira?
Instead of answering, she turned the subject and said, Do you know why this is called the Stone of
Broken Eggs?
No.
Because during the war between dragons and elves, the elves tracked us to this location and killed us
while we slept. They tore apart our nests, then shattered our eggs with their magic. That day, it rained
blood in the forest below. No dragon has lived here since.

Page 585

Eragon remained silent. That was not why he was here. He would wait until she could bring herself to
address the situation at hand.
Say something!demanded Saphira.
Will you let me heal your leg?
Leave well enough alone.
Then I shall remain as mute as a statue and sit here until I turn to dust, for I have the patience of a dragon
from you.
When they came, her words were halting, bitter, and self-mocking: It shames me to admit it. When we
first came here and I saw Glaedr, I felt such joy that another member of my race survived besides
Shruikan. I had never even seen another dragon before, except in Brom’s memories. And I
thought... I thought that Glaedr would be as pleased by my existence as I was by his.
But he was.
You don’t understand. I thought that he would be the mate I never ex-pected to have and that together
we could rebuild our race.She snorted, and a burst of flame escaped her nostrils. I was mistaken. He
does not want me.
Eragon chose his response with care to avoid offending her and to pro-vide a modicum of comfort.
That’s because he knows you are destined for someone else: one of the two remaining eggs. Nor
would it be proper for him to mate with you when he is your mentor.
Or perhaps he does not find me comely enough.
Saphira, no dragon is ugly, and you are the fairest of dragons.
I am a fool,she said. But she raised her left wing and kept it in the air as permission for him to tend to her
injury.
Eragon limped to Saphira’s side, where he examined the crimson wound, glad that Oromis had given
him so many scrolls on anatomy to read. The blow—by claw or tooth, he was not sure—had torn the
quad-riceps muscle beneath Saphira’s hide, but not so much as to bare the bone. Merely closing the
surface of the wound, as Eragon had done so many times, would not be enough. The muscle had to be
knitted back together.
The spell Eragon used was long and complex, and even he did not un-derstand all its parts, for he had
memorized it from an ancient text that offered little explanation beyond the statement that, given no bones
were broken and the internal organs were whole, “this charm will heal any ail-ment of violent origins,
excepting that of grim death.” Once he uttered it, Eragon watched with fascination as Saphira’s muscle
writhed beneath his hand—veins, nerves, and fibers weaving together—and became whole once more.
The wound was big enough that, in his weakened state, he dared not heal it with just the energy from his
body, so he drew upon Saphira’s strength as well.
It itches,said Saphira when he finished.
Eragon sighed and leaned his back against the rough basalt, looking at the sunset through his eyelashes. I

fear that you will have to carry me off this rock. I’m too tired to move.
With a dry rustle, she twisted in place and laid her head on the bones beside him. I have treated you
poorly ever since we came to Ellesméra. I ig-nored your advice when I should have listened. You
warned me about Glaedr, but I was too proud to see the truth in your words.... I have failed to be
a good companion for you, betrayed what it means to be a dragon, and tarnished the honor of the
Riders.
No, never that,he said vehemently. Saphira, you haven’t failed your duty. You may have made a
mistake, but it was an honest one, and one that anyone might have committed in your position.
That does not excuse my behavior toward you.
He tried to meet her eye, but she avoided his gaze until he touched her upon the neck and said, Saphira,
family members forgive one another, even if they don’t always understand why someone acts in a
certain way.... You are as much my family as Roran—more. Nothing you can do will ever change
that. Nothing. When she did not respond, he reached behind her jaw and tickled the patch of leathery
skin below one of her ears. Do you hear me, eh? Nothing!
She coughed low in her throat with reluctant amusement, then arched her neck and lifted her head to
escape his dancing fingers. How can I face Glaedr again? He was in a terrible rage.... The entire
stone shook with the force of his anger.
At least you held your own when he attacked you.
It was the other way around.
Caught by surprise, Eragon raised his eyebrows. Well, in any case, the only thing to do is to
apologize.
Apologize!
Aye. Go tell him that you are sorry, that this won’t happen again, and that you want to continue your
training with him. I’m sure he will be sym-pathetic if you give him the chance.
Very well,she said in a low voice.
You’ll feel better once you do.He grinned. I know from experience.
She grunted and padded to the edge of the cave, where she crouched and surveyed the rolling forest.
We should go. Soon it will be dark. Grit-ting his teeth, he forced himself upright—every movement
costing him effort—and climbed onto her back, taking twice the time he usually did. Eragon?... Thank
you for coming. I know what you risked with your back.
He patted her on the shoulder. Are we one again?
We are one.
THE GIFT OF DRAGONS

Page 587

The days leading up to the Agaetí Blödhren were the best and worst of times for Eragon. His back
troubled him more than ever, battering down his health and endurance and destroying his calm of mind;
he lived in constant fear of triggering an episode. Yet, in contrast, he and Saphira had never been so
close. They lived as much in each other’s minds as in their own. And every now and then Arya would
visit the tree house and walk through Ellesméra with Eragon and Saphira. She never came alone, though,
always bringing either Orik or Maud the werecat.
Over the course of their wanderings, Arya introduced Eragon and Saphira to elves of distinction: great
warriors, poets, and artists. She took them to concerts held under the thatched pines. And she showed
them many hidden wonders of Ellesméra.
Eragon seized every opportunity to talk with her. He told her about his upbringing in Palancar Valley,
about Roran, Garrow, and his aunt Marian, stories of Sloan, Ethlbert, and the other villagers, and his love
of the mountains surrounding Carvahall and the flaming sheets of light that adorned the winter sky at night.
He told her about the time a vixen fell into Gedric’s tanning vats and had to be fished out with a net. He
told her about the joy he found in planting a crop, weeding and nurturing it, and watching the tender green
shoots grow under his care—a joy that he knew she, of all people, could appreciate.
In turn, Eragon gleaned occasional insights into her own life. He heard mentions of her childhood, her
friends and family, and her experiences among the Varden, which she spoke about most freely,
describing raids and battles she participated in, treaties she helped to negotiate, her dis-putes with the
dwarves, and the momentous events she witnessed during her tenure as ambassador.
Between her and Saphira, a measure of peace entered Eragon’s heart, but it was a precarious balance
that the slightest influence might disrupt. Time itself was an enemy, for Arya was destined to leave Du
Welden-varden after the Agaetí Blödhren. Thus, Eragon treasured his moments with her and dreaded the
arrival of the forthcoming celebration.
The entire city bustled with activity as the elves prepared for the Agaetí Blödhren. Eragon had never
seen them so excited before. They decorated the forest with colored bunting and lanterns, especially
around the Menoa tree, while the tree itself was adorned with a lantern upon the tip of each branch,
where they hung like glowing teardrops. Even the plants, Eragon noticed, took on a festive appearance
with a collection of bright new flowers. He often heard the elves singing to them late at night.
Each day hundreds of elves arrived in Ellesméra from their cities scat-tered throughout the woods, for no
elf would willingly miss the centen-nial observance of their treaty with the dragons. Eragon guessed that
many of them also came to meet Saphira. It seems as if I do nothing but repeat their greeting, he
thought. The elves who were absent because of their responsibilities would hold their own festivities
simultaneously and would participate in the ceremonies at Ellesméra by scrying through en-chanted
mirrors that displayed the likeness of those watching, so that no one felt as if they were being spied upon.
A week before the Agaetí Blödhren, when Eragon and Saphira were about to return to their quarters
from the Crags of Tel’naeír, Oromis said, “You should both think about what you can bring to the
Blood-oath Celebration. Unless your creations require magic to make or to function, I suggest that you
avoid using gramarye. No one will respect your work if it’s the product of a spell and not of your own
hands. I also suggest you each make a separate piece. That too is custom.”
In the air, Eragon asked Saphira, Do you have any ideas?
I might have one. But if you don’t mind, I’d like to see if it works before I tell you.He caught part of an

image from her of a bare knuckle of stone protruding from the forest floor before she concealed it from
him.
He grinned. Won’t you give me a hint?
Fire. Lots of fire.
Back in their tree house, Eragon cataloged his skills and thought, I know more about farming than
anything else, but I don’t see how I can turn that to my advantage. Nor can I hope to compete
with the elves with magic or match their accomplishments with the crafts I am familiar with.
Their tal-ent exceeds that of the finest artisans in the Empire.
But you possess one quality that no one else does,said Saphira.
Oh?
Your identity. Your history, deeds, and situation. Use those to shape your creation and you will produce
something unique. Whatever you make, base it upon that which is most important to you. Only then will it
have depth and meaning, and only then will it resonate with others.
He looked at her with surprise. I never realized that you knew so much about art.
I don’t,she said. You forget I spent an afternoon watching Oromis paint his scrolls while you flew
with Glaedr. Oromis discussed the topic quite a bit.
Ah, yes. I had forgotten.
After Saphira left to pursue her project, Eragon paced along the edge of the open portal in the bedroom,
pondering what she had said. What’s im-portant to me? he asked himself. Saphira and Arya, of
course, and being a good Rider, but what can I say about those subjects that isn’t blindingly
ob-vious? I appreciate beauty in nature, but, again, the elves have already ex-pressed everything
possible on that topic. Ellesméra itself is a monument to their devotion. He turned his gaze inward
and scrutinized himself to de-termine what struck the deepest, darkest chords within him. What stirred
him with enough passion—of either love or hate—that he burned to share it with others?
Three things presented themselves to him: his injury at the hands of Durza, his fear of one day fighting
Galbatorix, and the elves’ epics that so engrossed him.
A rush of excitement flared within Eragon as a story combining those elements took form in his mind.
Light on his feet, he ran up the twisting stairs—two at a time—to the study, where he sat before the
writing desk, dipped quill in ink, and held it trembling over a pale sheet of paper.
The nib rasped as he made the first stroke:
In the kingdom by the sea,
In the mountains mantled blue...
The words flowed from his pen seemingly of their own accord. He felt as if he were not inventing his
tale, but merely acting as a conduit to transport it fully formed into the world. Having never composed a
work of his own before, Eragon was gripped by the thrill of discovery that accompanies new

ventures—especially since, previously, he had not sus-pected that he might enjoy being a bard.
He labored in a frenzy, not stopping for bread or drink, his tunic sleeves rolled past his elbows to protect
them from the ink flicked from his quill by the wild force of his writing. So intense was his concentra-tion,
he heard nothing but the beat of his poem, saw nothing but the empty paper, and thought of nothing but
the phrases etched in lines of fire behind his eyes.
An hour and a half later, he dropped the quill from his cramped hand, pushed his chair away from the
desk, and stood. Fourteen pages lay be-fore him. It was the most he had ever written at one time.
Eragon knew that his poem could not match those of the elves’ and dwarves’ great au-thors, but he
hoped it was honest enough that the elves would not laugh at his effort.
He recited the poem to Saphira when she returned. Afterward, she said, Ah, Eragon, you have
changed much since we left Palancar Valley. You would not recognize the untested boy who first
set out for vengeance, I think. That Eragon could not have written a lay after the style of the
elves. I look forward to seeing who you become in the next fifty or a hundred years.
He smiled. If I live that long.
“Rough but true,” was what Oromis said when Eragon read him the poem.
“Then you like it?”
“’Tis a good portrait of your mental state at the present and an engaging read, but no masterpiece. Did
you expect it to be?”
“I suppose not.”
“However, I am surprised that you can give voice to it in this tongue. No barrier exists to writing fiction
in the ancient language. The difficulty arises when one attempts to speak it, for that would require you to
tell untruths, which the magic will not allow.”
“I can say it,” replied Eragon, “because I believe it’s true.”
“And that gives your writing far more power.... I am impressed, Eragon-finiarel. Your poem will be a
worthy addition to the Blood-oath Celebra-tion.” Raising a finger, Oromis reached within his robe and
gave Eragon a scroll tied shut with ribbon. “Inscribed on that paper are nine wards I want you to place
about yourself and the dwarf Orik. As you discovered at Sílthrim, our festivities are potent and not for
those with constitutions weaker than ours. Unprotected, you risk losing yourself in the web of our magic.
I have seen it happen. Even with these precautions, you must take care you are not swayed by fancies
wafted on the breeze. Be on your guard, for during this time, we elves are apt to go mad—wonderfully,
gloriously mad, but mad all the same.”
On the eve of the Agaetí Blödhren—which was to last three days— Eragon, Saphira, and Orik
accompanied Arya to the Menoa tree, where a host of elves were assembled, their black and silver hair
flickering in the lamplight. Islanzadí stood upon a raised root at the base of the trunk, as tall, pale, and fair
as a birch tree. Blagden roosted on the queen’s left shoulder, while Maud, the werecat, lurked behind
her. Glaedr was there, as well as Oromis garbed in red and black, and other elves Eragon recog-nized,
such as Lifaen and Narí and, to his distaste, Vanir. Overhead, the stars glittered in the velvet sky.
“Wait here,” said Arya. She slipped through the crowd and returned leading Rhunön. The smith blinked

Page 590

like an owl at her surroundings. Er-agon greeted her, and she nodded to him and Saphira. “Well met,
Bright scales and Shadeslayer.” Then she spied Orik and addressed him in Dwar-vish, to which Orik
replied with enthusiasm, obviously delighted to con-verse with someone in the rough speech of his native
land.
“What did she say?” asked Eragon, bending down.
“She invited me to her home to view her work and discuss metal work-ing.” Awe crossed Orik’s face.
“Eragon, she first learned her craft from Fûthark himself, one of the legendary grimstborithn of Dûrgrimst
Ingei-tum! What I would give to have met him.”
Together they waited until the stroke of midnight, when Islanzadí raised her bare left arm so that it
pointed toward the new moon like a marble spear. A soft white orb gathered itself above her palm from
the light emitted by the lanterns that dotted the Menoa tree. Then Islanzadí walked along the root to the
massive trunk and placed the orb in a hollow in the bark, where it remained, pulsing.
Eragon turned to Arya. “Is it begun?”
“It is begun!” She laughed. “And it will end when the werelight expends itself.”
The elves divided themselves into informal camps throughout the for-est and clearing that encircled the
Menoa tree. Seemingly out of nowhere, they produced tables laden high with fantastic dishes, which from
their unearthly appearance were as much the result of the spellweavers’ handiwork as the cooks’.
Then the elves began to sing in their clear, flutelike voices. They sang many songs, yet each was but part
of a larger melody that wove an en-chantment over the dreamy night, heightening senses, removing
inhibi-tions, and burnishing the revels with fey magic. Their verses concerned heroic deeds and quests by
ship and horse to forgotten lands and the sor-row of lost beauty. The throbbing music enveloped Eragon,
and he felt a wild abandon take hold of him, a desire to run free of his life and dance through elven glades
forever more. Beside him, Saphira hummed along with the tune, her glazed eyes lidded halfway.
What transpired afterward, Eragon was never able to adequately recall. It was as if he had a fever and
faded in and out of consciousness. He could remember certain incidents with vivid clarity—bright,
pungent flashes filled with merriment—but it was beyond him to reconstruct the order in which they
occurred. He lost track of whether it was day or night, for no matter the time, dusk seemed to pervade
the forest. Nor could he ever say if he had slumbered, or needed sleep, during the cele-bration....
He remembered spinning in circles while holding the hands of an elf-maid with cherry lips, the taste of
honey on his tongue and the smell of juniper in the air....
He remembered elves perched on the outstretched branches of the Menoa tree, like a flock of starlings.
They strummed golden harps and called riddles to Glaedr below and, now and then, pointed a finger at
the sky, whereupon a burst of colored embers would appear in various shapes before fading away....
He remembered sitting in a dell, propped against Saphira, and watching the same elf-maid sway before a
rapt audience while she sang:
Away, away, you shall fly away,
O’er the peaks and vales

Page 591

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

To the lands beyond.
Away, away, you shall fly away,
And never return to me.
Gone! Gone you shall be from me,
And I will never see you again.
Gone! Gone you shall be from me,
Though I wait for you evermore.
He remembered endless poems, some mournful, others joyful—most both. He heard Arya’s poem in full
and thought it fine indeed, and Islan-zadí’s, which was longer but of equal merit. All the elves gathered to
lis-ten to those two works....
He remembered the wonders the elves had made for the celebration, many of which he would have
deemed impossible beforehand, even with the assistance of magic. Puzzles and toys, art and weapons,
and items whose function escaped him. One elf had charmed a glass ball so that every few seconds a
different flower bloomed within its heart. Another elf had spent decades traveling Du Weldenvarden and
memorizing the sounds of the elements, the most beautiful of which he now played from the throats of a
hundred white lilies.
Rhunön contributed a shield that would not break, a pair of gloves woven from steel thread that allowed
the wearer to handle molten lead and other such items without harm, and a delicate sculpture of a wren in
flight chiseled from a solid block of metal and painted with such skill that the bird seemed alive.
A tiered wood pyramid eight inches high and constructed of fifty-eight interlocking pieces was Orik’s
offering, much to the elves’ delight, who insisted upon disassembling and reassembling the pyramid as
often as he would allow. “Master Longbeard,” they called him, and said, “Clever fin-gers mean a clever
mind.”...
He remembered Oromis pulling him aside, away from the music, and asking the elf, “What’s wrong?”
“You need to clear your mind.” Oromis guided him to a fallen log and had him sit. “Stay here for a few
minutes. You will feel better.”
“I’m fine. I don’t need to rest,” protested Eragon.
“You are in no position to judge yourself right now. Stay here until you can list the spells of changing,
great and minor, and then you may rejoin us. Promise me this.”...
He remembered creatures dark and strange, drifting in from the depths of the forest. The majority were
animals who had been altered by the ac-cumulated spells in Du Weldenvarden and were now drawn to
the Agaetí Blödhren as a starving man is drawn to food. They seemed to find nourishment in the presence
of the elves’ magic. Most dared reveal them-selves only as pairs of glowing eyes on the outskirts of the
lantern light. One animal that did expose itself was the she-wolf—in the form of a white-robed
woman—that Eragon had encountered before. She lurked behind a dogwood bush, dagger teeth bared
in an amused grin, her yellow eyes darting from point to point.

Page 592

But not all the creatures were animals. Some few were elves who had altered their original forms for
functionality or in pursuit of a different ideal of beauty. An elf covered in brindled fur leaped over Eragon
and continued to gambol about, as often on all fours as on his feet. His head was narrow and elongated
with ears like a cat, his arms hung to his knees, and his long-fingered hands had rough pads on the palm.
Later, two identical elf women presented themselves to Saphira. They moved with languid grace and,
when they touched their hands to their lips in the traditional greeting, Eragon saw that their fingers were
joined by translucent webbing. “We have come far,” they whispered. As they spoke, three rows of gills
pulsed on each side of their slender necks, ex-posing pink flesh underneath. Their skin glistened as if with
oil. Their lank hair hung past their narrow shoulders.
He met an elf armored in imbricated scales like a dragon, with a bony crest upon his head, a line of
spikes that ran down his back, and two pal-lid flames that ever flickered in the pits of his flared nostrils.
And he met others who were not so recognizable: elves whose outlines wavered as if seen through
water; elves who, when motionless, were in-distinguishable from trees; tall elves with eyes of black, even
where the whites should have been, who possessed an awful beauty that frightened Eragon and, when
they chanced to touch something, passed through it like shadows.
The ultimate example of this phenomenon was the Menoa tree, which was once the elf Linnëa. The tree
seemed to quicken with life at the ac-tivity in the clearing. Its branches stirred, though no breeze touched
them, at times the creaks of its trunk could be heard to match the flow of music, and an air of gentle
benevolence emanated from the tree and lay upon those in the vicinity....
And he remembered two attacks from his back, screaming and groan-ing in the shadows while the mad
elves continued their revels around him and only Saphira came to guard over him....
On the third day of the Agaetí Blödhren, or so Eragon later learned, he delivered his verses to the elves.
He stood and said, “I am no smith, nor skilled at carving or weaving or pottery or painting or any of the
arts. Nor can I rival your accomplishments with spells. Thus, all that remains to me are my own
experiences, which I have attempted to interpret through the lens of a story, though I am also no bard.”
Then, in the man-ner that Brom had performed lays in Carvahall, Eragon chanted:
In the kingdom by the sea,
In the mountains mantled blue,On frigid winter’s final dayWas born a man with but one task:
To kill the foe in Durza,In the land of shadows.
Nurtured by the kind and wiseUnder oaks as old as time,He ran with deer and wrestled bears,And from
his elders learned the skills,
To kill the foe in Durza,In the land of shadows.
Taught to spy the thief in blackWhen he grabs the weak and strong;To block his blows and fight the
fiendWith rag and rock and plant and bone;
And kill the foe in Durza,In the land of shadows.
Quick as thought, the years did turn,’Til the man had come of age,

Page 593

His body burned with fevered rage,While youth’s impatience seared his veins.
Then he met a maiden fair,Who was tall and strong and wise,Her brow adorned with Gëda’s
Light,Which shone upon her trailing gown.
In her eyes of midnight blue,In those enigmatic pools,Appeared to him a future bright,Together, where
they would not have
To fear the foe in Durza,In the land of shadows.
So Eragon told of how the man voyaged to the land of Durza, where he found and fought the foe,
despite the cold terror within his heart. Yet though at last he triumphed, the man withheld the fatal blow,
for now that he had defeated his enemy, he did not fear the doom of mortals. He did not need to kill the
foe in Durza. Then the man sheathed his sword and returned home and wed his love on summer’s eve.
With her, he spent his many days content until his beard was long and white. But:
In the dark before the dawn,In the room where slept the man,The foe, he crept and loomed above
His mighty rival now so weak.
From his pillow did the manRaise his head and gaze uponThe cold and empty face of Death,The king of
everlasting night.
Calm acceptance filled the man’sAged heart; for long ago,He’d lost all fear of Death’s embrace,The last
embrace a man will know.
Gentle as a morning breeze,Bent the foe and from the manHis glowing, pulsing spirit took,And thence in
peace they went to dwell,Forevermore in Durza,In the land of shadows.
Eragon fell quiet and, conscious of the eyes upon him, ducked his head and quickly found his seat. He
felt embarrassed that he had revealed so much of himself.
The elf lord, Däthedr, said, “You underestimate yourself, Shadeslayer. It seems that you have
discovered a new talent.”
Islanzadí raised one pale hand. “Your work shall be added to the great library in Tialdarí Hall,
Eragon-finiarel, so that all who wish can appreci-ate it. Though your poem is allegory, I believe that it has
helped many of us to better understand the hardships you have faced since Saphira’s egg appeared to
you, for which we are, in no small way, responsible. You must read it to us again so we may think upon
this further.”
Pleased, Eragon bowed his head and did as she commanded. Afterward was time for Saphira to present
her work to the elves. She flew off into the night and returned with a black stone thrice the size of a large
man clutched in her talons. Landing on her hind legs, she placed the stone up-right in the middle of the
bare greensward, in full view of everyone. The glossy rock had been melted and somehow molded into
intricate curves that wound about each other, like frozen waves. The striated tongues of rock twisted in
such convoluted patterns that the eye had difficulty fol-lowing a single piece from base to tip, but rather
flitted from one coil to the next.
As it was his first time seeing the sculpture, Eragon gazed at it with as much interest as the elves. How

Page 594

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

did you make this?
Saphira’s eyes twinkled with amusement. By licking the molten rock. Then she bent and breathed fire
long upon the stone, bathing it in a golden pillar that ascended toward the stars and clawed at them with
lu-cent fingers. When Saphira closed her jaws, the paper-thin edges of the sculpture glowed cherry red,
while small flames flickered in the dark hol-lows and recesses throughout the rock. The flowing strands of
rock seemed to move under the hypnotic light.
The elves exclaimed with wonder, clapping their hands and dancing about the piece. An elf cried, “Well
wrought, Brightscales!”
It’s beautiful,said Eragon.
Saphira touched him on the arm with her nose. Thank you, little one.
Then Glaedr brought out his offering: a slab of red oak that he had carved with the point of one talon into
a likeness of Ellesméra as seen from high above. And Oromis revealed his contribution: the completed
scroll that Eragon had often watched him illustrate during their lessons. Along the top half of the scroll
marched columns of glyphs—a copy of “The Lay of Vestarí the Mariner”—while along the bottom half
ran a panorama of a fantastic landscape, rendered with breathtaking artistry, detail, and skill.
Arya took Eragon’s hand then and drew him through the forest and toward the Menoa tree, where she
said, “Look how the werelight dims.
We have but a few hours left to us before dawn arrives and we must re-turn to the world of cold
reason.”
Around the tree, the host of elves gathered, their faces bright with ea-ger anticipation. With great dignity,
Islanzadí emerged from within their midst and walked along a root as wide as a pathway until it angled
up-ward and doubled back on itself. She stood upon the gnarled shelf over-looking the slender, waiting
elves. “As is our custom, and as was agreed upon at the end of The Dragon War by Queen Tarmunora,
the first Er-agon, and the white dragon who represented his race—he whose name cannot be uttered in
this or any language—when they bound the fates of elves and dragons together, we have met to honor
our blood-oath with song and dance and the fruits of our labor. Last this celebration occurred, many long
years ago, our situation was desperate indeed. It has improved somewhat since, the result of our efforts,
the dwarves’, and the Varden’s, though Alagaësia still lies under the black shadow of the Wyrdfell and
we must still live with our shame of how we have failed the dragons.
“Of the Riders of eld, only Oromis and Glaedr remain. Brom and many others entered the void this past
century. However, new hope has been granted to us in the form of Eragon and Saphira, and it is only
right and proper that they should be here now, as we reaffirm the oath between our races three.”
At the queen’s signal, the elves cleared a wide expanse at the base of the Menoa tree. Around the
perimeter, they staked a ring of lanterns mounted upon carved poles, while musicians with flutes, harps,
and drums assembled along the ridge of one long root. Guided by Arya to the edge of the circle, Eragon
found himself seated between her and Oromis, while Saphira and Glaedr crouched on either side of them
like gem-studded bluffs.
To Eragon and Saphira, Oromis said, “Watch you carefully, for this is of great importance to your
heritage as Riders.”

When all the elves were settled, two elf-maids walked to the center of the space in the host and stood
with their backs to each other. They were exceedingly beautiful and identical in every respect, except for
their hair: one had tresses as black as a forgotten pool, while the other’s hair gleamed like burnished
silver wire.
“The Caretakers, Iduna and Nëya,” whispered Oromis.
From Islanzadí’s shoulder, Blagden shrieked, “Wyrda!”
Moving in unison, the two elves raised their hands to the brooches at their throats, unclasped them, and
allowed their white robes to fall away. Though they wore no garments, the women were clad in an
iridescent tattoo of a dragon. The tattoo began with the dragon’s tail wrapped around the left ankle of
Iduna, continued up her leg and thigh, over her torso, and then across Nëya’s back, ending with the
dragon’s head on Nëya’s chest. Every scale on the dragon was inked a different color; the vibrant hues
gave the tattoo the appearance of a rainbow.
The elf-maids twined their hands and arms together so that the dragon appeared to be a continuous
whole, rippling from one body to the next without interruption. Then they each lifted a bare foot and
brought it down on the packed ground with a soft thump.
And again: thump.
On the third thump, the musicians struck their drums in rhythm. A thump later, the harpists plucked the
strings of their gilt instruments, and a moment after that, those elves with flutes joined the throbbing
melody.
Slowly at first, but with gathering speed, Iduna and Nëya began to dance, marking time with the stamp
of their feet on the dirt and undulat-ing so that it was not they who seemed to move but the dragon upon
them. Round and round they went, and the dragon flew endless circles across their skin.
Then the twins added their voices to the music, building upon the pounding beat with their fierce cries,
their lyrics verses of a spell so com-plex that its meaning escaped Eragon. Like the rising wind that
precedes a storm, the elves accompanied the incantation, singing with one tongue and one mind and one
intent. Eragon did not know the words but found himself mouthing them along with the elves, swept along
by the inexo-rable cadence. He heard Saphira and Glaedr hum in concordance, a deep pulse so strong
that it vibrated within his bones and made his skin tingle and the air shimmer.
Faster and faster spun Iduna and Nëya until their feet were a dusty blur and their hair fanned about them
and they glistened with a film of sweat. The elf-maids accelerated to an inhuman speed and the music
climaxed in a frenzy of chanted phrases. Then a flare of light ran the length of the dragon tattoo, from
head to tail, and the dragon stirred. At first Eragon thought his eyes had deceived him, until the creature
blinked, raised his wings, and clenched his talons.
A burst of flame erupted from the dragon’s maw and he lunged for-ward and pulled himself free of the
elves’ skin, climbing into the air, where he hovered, flapping his wings. The tip of his tail remained
con-nected to the twins below, like a glowing umbilical cord. The giant beast strained toward the black
moon and loosed an untamed roar of ages past, then turned and surveyed the assembled elves.
As the dragon’s baleful eye fell upon him, Eragon knew that the crea-ture was no mere apparition but a
conscious being bound and sustained by magic. Saphira and Glaedr’s humming grew ever louder until it
blocked all other sound from Eragon’s ears. Above, the specter of their race looped down over the

Page 596

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

elves, brushing them with an insubstantial wing. It came to a stop before Eragon, engulfing him in an
endless, whirl-ing gaze. Bidden by some instinct, Eragon raised his right hand, his palm tingling.
In his mind echoed a voice of fire: Our gift so you may do what you must.
The dragon bent his neck and, with his snout, touched the heart of Er-agon’s gedwëy ignasia. A spark
jumped between them, and Eragon went rigid as incandescent heat poured through his body, consuming
his in-sides. His vision flashed red and black, and the scar on his back burned as if branded. Fleeing to
safety, he fell deep within himself, where darkness grasped him and he had not the strength to resist it.
Last, he again heard the voice of fire say, Our gift to you.
IN A STARRY GLADE

Eragon was alone when he woke.
He opened his eyes to stare at the carved ceiling in the tree house he and Saphira shared. Outside, night
still reigned and the sounds of the elves’ revels drifted from the glittering city below.
Before he noticed more than that, Saphira leaped into his mind, radiat-ing concern and anxiety. An
image passed to him of her standing beside Islanzadí at the Menoa tree, then she asked, How are you?
I feel... good. Better than I’ve felt in a long time. How long have I—
Only an hour. I would have stayed with you, but they needed Oromis, Glaedr, and me to complete the
ceremony. You should have seen the elves’ reaction when you fainted. Nothing like this has occurred
before.
Did you cause this, Saphira?
It was not my work alone, nor Glaedr’s. The memories of our race, which were given form and
substance by the elves’ magic, anointed you with what skill we dragons possess, for you are our best
hope to avoid extinction.
I don’t understand.
Look in a mirror,she suggested. Then rest and recover and I shall rejoin you at dawn.
She left, and Eragon got to his feet and stretched, amazed by the sense of well-being that pervaded him.
Going to the wash closet, he retrieved the mirror he used for shaving and brought it into the light of a
nearby lantern.
Eragon froze with surprise.
It was as if the numerous physical changes that, over time, alter the ap-pearance of a human Rider—and
which Eragon had already begun to ex-perience since bonding with Saphira—had been completed while
he was unconscious. His face was now as smooth and angled as an elf’s, with ears tapered like theirs and
eyes slanted like theirs, and his skin was as pale as alabaster and seemed to emit a faint glow, as if with
the sheen of magic. I look like a princeling. Eragon had never before applied the term to a man, least of

Page 597

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

all himself, but the only word that described him now was beau-tiful. Yet he was not entirely an elf. His
jaw was stronger, his brow thicker, his face broader. He was fairer than any human and more rugged
than any elf.
With trembling fingers, Eragon reached around the nape of his neck in search of his scar.
He felt nothing.
Eragon tore off his tunic and twisted in front of the mirror to examine his back. It was as smooth as it
had been before the battle of Farthen Dûr. Tears sprang to Eragon’s eyes as he slid his hand over the
place where Durza had maimed him. He knew that his back would never trouble him again.
Not only was the savage blight he had elected to keep gone, but every other scar and blemish had
vanished from his body, leaving him as un-marked as a newborn babe. Eragon traced a line upon his
wrist where he had cut himself while sharpening Garrow’s scythe. No evidence of the wound remained.
The blotchy scars on the insides of his thighs, remnants from his first flight with Saphira, had also
disappeared. For a moment, he missed them as a record of his life, but his regret was short-lived as he
re-alized that the damage from every injury he had ever suffered, no matter how small, had been
repaired.
I have become what I was meant to be,he thought, and took a deep breath of the intoxicating air.
He dropped the mirror on the bed and garbed himself in his finest clothes: a crimson tunic stitched with
gold thread; a belt studded with white jade; warm, felted leggings; a pair of the cloth boots favored by
the elves; and upon his forearms, leather vambraces the dwarves had given him.
Descending from the tree, Eragon wandered the shadows of Ellesméra and observed the elves carousing
in the fever of the night. None of them recognized him, though they greeted him as one of their own and
invited him to share in their saturnalias.
Eragon floated in a state of heightened awareness, his senses thrumming with the multitude of new sights,
sounds, smells, and feelings that as-sailed him. He could see in darkness that would have blinded him
before. He could touch a leaf and, by touch alone, count the individual hairs that grew upon it. He could
identify the odors wafting about him as well as a wolf or a dragon. And he could hear the patter of mice
in the underbrush and the noise a flake of bark makes as it falls to earth; the beating of his heart was as a
drum to him.
His aimless path led him past the Menoa tree, where he paused to watch Saphira among the festivities,
though he did not reveal himself to those in the glade.
Where go you, little one?she asked.
He saw Arya rise from her mother’s side, make her way through the gathered elves, and then, like a
forest sprite, glide underneath the trees beyond. I walk between the candle and the dark, he replied,
and followed Arya.
Eragon tracked Arya by her delicate scent of crushed pine needles, by the feathery touch of her foot
upon the ground, and by the disturbance of her wake in the air. He found her standing alone on the edge
of a clearing, poised like a wild creature as she watched the constellations turn in the sky above.
As Eragon emerged in the open, Arya looked at him, and he felt as if she saw him for the first time. Her

Page 598

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

eyes widened, and she whispered, “Is that you, Eragon?”
“Aye.”
“What have they done to you?”
“I know not.”
He went to her, and together they wandered the dense woods, which echoed with fragments of music
and voices from the festivities. Changed as he was, Eragon was acutely conscious of Arya’s presence, of
the whis-per of her clothes over her skin, of the soft, pale exposure of her neck, and of her eyelashes,
which were coated with a layer of oil that made them glisten and curl like black petals wet with rain.
They stopped on the bank of a narrow stream so clear, it was invisible in the faint light. The only thing
that betrayed its presence was the throaty gurgle of water pouring over rocks. Around them, the thick
pines formed a cave with their branches, hiding Eragon and Arya from the world and muffling the cool,
still air. The hollow seemed ageless, as if it were removed from the world and protected by some magic
against the withering breath of time.
In that secret place, Eragon felt suddenly close to Arya, and all his pas-sion for her sprang to the fore of
his mind. He was so intoxicated with the strength and vitality coursing through his veins—as well as the
un-tamed magic that filled the forest—he ignored caution and said, “How tall the trees, how bright the
stars... and how beautiful you are, O Arya Svit-kona.” Under normal circumstances, he would have
considered his deed the height of folly, but in that fey, madcap night, it seemed per-fectly sane.
She stiffened. “Eragon...”
He ignored her warning. “Arya, I’ll do anything to win your hand. I would follow you to the ends of the
earth. I would build a palace for you with nothing but my bare hands. I would—”
“Will you stop pursuing me? Can you promise me that?” When he hesitated, she stepped closer and
said, low and gentle, “Eragon, this can-not be. You are young and I am old, and that shall never change.”
“Do you feel nothing for me?”
“My feelings for you,” she said, “are those of a friend and nothing more. I am grateful to you for rescuing
me from Gil’ead, and I find your com-pany pleasant. That is all.... Relinquish this quest of yours—it will
only bring you heartache—and find someone your own age to spend the long years with.”
His eyes brimmed with tears. “How can you be so cruel?”
“I am not cruel, but kind. You and I are not meant for each other.”
In desperation, he suggested, “You could give me your memories, and then I would have the same
amount of experience and knowledge as you.”
“It would be an abomination.” Arya lifted her chin, her face grave and solemn and brushed with silver
from the glimmering stars. A hint of steel entered her voice: “Hear me well, Eragon. This cannot, nor ever
shall be. And until you master yourself, our friendship must cease to exist, for your emotions do nothing
but distract us from our duty.” She bowed to him. “Goodbye, Eragon Shadeslayer.” Then she strode
past and vanished into Du Weldenvarden.

Now the tears spilled down Eragon’s cheeks and dropped to the moss below, where they lay
unabsorbed, like pearls strewn across a blanket of emerald velvet. Numb, Eragon sat upon a rotting log
and buried his face in his hands, weeping that his affection for Arya was doomed to remain unrequited,
and weeping that he had driven her further away.
Within moments, Saphira joined him. Oh, little one. She nuzzled him. Why did you have to inflict this
upon yourself? You knew what would hap-pen if you tried to woo Arya again.
I couldn’t stop myself.He wrapped his arms around his belly and rocked back and forth on the log,
reduced to hiccuping sobs by the strength of his misery. Putting one warm wing over him, Saphira drew
him close to her side, like a mother falcon with her offspring. He curled up against her and remained
huddled there as night passed into day and the Agaetí Blödhren came to an end.
LANDFALL

Roran stood upon the poop deck of the Red Boar, his arms crossed over his chest and his feet planted
wide apart to steady himself on the rolling barge. The salty wind ruffled his hair and tugged at his thick
beard and tickled the hairs on his bare forearms.
Beside him, Clovis manned the tiller. The weathered sailor pointed to-ward the coastline at a
seagull-covered rock silhouetted on the crest of a rolling hill that extended into the ocean. “Teirm be right
on the far side of that peak.”
Roran squinted into the afternoon sun, which reflected off the ocean in a blindingly bright band. “We’ll
stop here for now, then.”
“You don’t want to go on into the city yet?”
“Not all of us at once. Call over Torson and Flint and have them run the barges up on that shore. It
looks like a good place to camp.”
Clovis grimaced. “Arrgh. I was hoping t’ get a hot meal tonight.” Roran understood; the fresh food from
Narda had long since been eaten, leaving them with naught but salt pork, salted herring, salted cabbage,
sea bis-cuits the villagers had made from their purchased flour, pickled vegeta-bles, and the occasional
fresh meat when the villagers slaughtered one of their few remaining animals or managed to catch game
when they landed.
Clovis’s rough voice echoed over the water as he shouted to the skip-pers of the other two barges.
When they drew near, he ordered them to pull ashore, much to their vociferous displeasure. They and the
other sailors had counted on reaching Teirm that day and lavishing their pay on the city’s delights.
After the barges were beached, Roran walked among the villagers and helped them by pitching tents
here and there, unloading equipment, fetching water from a nearby stream, and otherwise lending his
assistance until everyone was settled. He paused to give Morn and Tara a word of encouragement, for
they appeared despondent, and received a guarded response in turn. The tavern owner and his wife had
been aloof to him ever since they left Palancar Valley. On the whole, the villagers were in better condition
than when they arrived at Narda due to the rest they had garnered on the barges, but constant worry and
exposure to the harsh elements had prevented them from recuperating as well as Roran hoped.

“Stronghammer, will you sup at our tent tonight?” asked Thane, coming up to Roran.
Roran declined with as much grace as he could and turned to find him-self confronted by Felda, whose
husband, Byrd, had been murdered by Sloan. She bobbed a quick curtsy, then said, “May I speak with
you, Ro-ran Garrowsson?”
He smiled at her. “Always, Felda. You know that.”
“Thank you.” With a furtive expression, she fingered the tassels that edged her shawl and glanced
toward her tent. “I would ask a favor of you. It’s about Mandel—” Roran nodded; he had chosen her
eldest son to ac-company him into Narda on that fateful trip when he killed the two guards. Mandel had
performed admirably then, as well as in the weeks since while he crewed the Edeline and learned what
he could about pilot-ing the barges. “He’s become quite friendly with the sailors on our barge and he’s
started playing dice with those lawless men. Not for money—we have none—but for small things. Things
we need.”
“Have you asked him to stop?”
Felda twisted the tassels. “I fear that, since his father died, he no longer respects me as he once did. He
has grown wild and willful.”
We have all grown wild,thought Roran. “And what would you have me do about it?” he asked gently.
“You have ever dealt generously with Mandel. He admires you. If you talk with him, he will listen.”
Roran considered the request, then said, “Very well, I will do what I can.” Felda sagged with relief. “Tell
me, though, what has he lost at dice?”
“Food mostly.” Felda hesitated and then added, “But I know he once risked my grandmother’s bracelet
for a rabbit those men snared.”
Roran frowned. “Put your heart at ease, Felda. I will tend to the matter as soon as I can.”
“Thank you.” Felda curtsied again, then slipped away between the makeshift tents, leaving Roran to mull
over what she had said.
Roran absently scratched his beard as he walked. The problem with Mandel and the sailors was a
problem that cut both ways; Roran had no-ticed that during the trip from Narda, one of Torson’s men,
Frewin, had become close to Odele—a young friend of Katrina. They could cause trouble when we
leave Clovis.
Taking care not to attract undue attention, Roran went through the camp and gathered the villagers he
trusted the most and had them ac-company him to Horst’s tent, where he said, “The five we agreed upon
will leave now, before it gets much later. Horst will take my place while I’m gone. Remember that your
most important task is to ensure Clovis doesn’t leave with the barges or damage them in any way. They
may be our only means to reach Surda.”
“That, and make sure we aren’t discovered,” commented Orval.
“Exactly. If none of us have returned by nightfall day after tomorrow, assume we were captured. Take

Page 601

the barges and set sail for Surda, but don’t stop in Kuasta to buy provisions; the Empire will probably be
lying in wait there. You’ll have to find food elsewhere.”
While his companions readied themselves, Roran went to Clovis’s cabin on the Red Boar. “Just the five
of you be going?” demanded Clovis after Roran explained their plan.
“That’s right.” Roran let his iron gaze bore into Clovis until the man fidgeted with unease. “And when I
get back, I expect you, these barges, and every one of your men to still be here.”
“You dare impugn my honor after how I’ve kept our bargain?”
“I impugn nothing, only tell you what I expect. Too much is at stake. If you commit treachery now, you
condemn our entire village to death.”
“That I know,” muttered Clovis, avoiding his eyes.
“My people will defend themselves during my absence. So long as breath remains in their lungs, they’ll
not be taken, tricked, or abandoned. And if misfortune were to befall them, I’d avenge them even if I had
to walk a thousand leagues and fight Galbatorix himself. Heed my words, Master Clovis, for I speak the
truth.”
“We’re not so fond of the Empire as you seem to believe,” protested Clovis. “I wouldn’t do them a
favor more than the next man.”
Roran smiled with grim amusement. “Men will do anything to protect their families and homes.”
As Roran lifted the door latch, Clovis asked, “And what will you do once you reach Surda?”
“We will—”
“Not we: you. What will you do? I’ve watched you, Roran. I’ve listened to you. An’ you seem a good
enough sort, even if I don’t care for how you dealt with me. But I cannot fit it in my head, you dropping
that hammer of yours and taking up the plow again, just because you’ve arrived in Surda.”
Roran gripped the latch until his knuckles turned white. “When I have delivered the village to Surda,” he
said in a voice as empty as a blackened desert, “then I shall go hunting.”
“Ah. After that redheaded lass of yours? I heard some talk of that, but I didn’t put—”
The door slammed behind Roran as he left the cabin. He let his anger burn hot and fast for a
moment—enjoying the freedom of the emotion— before he began to subdue his unruly passions. He
marched to Felda’s tent, where Mandel was throwing a hunting knife at a stump.
Felda’s right; someone has to talk some sense into him.“ You’re wasting your time,” said Roran.
Mandel whirled around with surprise. “Why do you say that?”
“In a real fight, you’re more likely to put out your own eye than injure your enemy. If you don’t know
the exact distance between you and your target...” Roran shrugged. “You might as well throw rocks.”
He watched with detached interest as the younger man bristled with pride. “Gunnar told me about a man

Page 602

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

he knew in Cithrí who could hit a flying crow with his knife eight times out of ten.”
“And the other two times you get killed. It’s usually a bad idea to throw away your weapon in battle.”
Roran waved a hand, forestalling Mandel’s objections. “Get your kit together and meet me on the hill
past the stream in fifteen minutes. I’ve decided you should come with us to Teirm.”
“Yes, sir!” With an enthusiastic grin, Mandel dove into the tent and be-gan packing.
As Roran left, he encountered Felda, her youngest daughter balanced on one hip. Felda glanced
between him and Mandel’s activity in the tent, and her expression tightened. “Keep him safe,
Stronghammer.” She set her daughter on the ground and then bustled about, helping to gather the items
Mandel would need.
Roran was the first to arrive at the designated hill. He squatted on a white boulder and watched the sea
while he readied himself for the task ahead. When Loring, Gertrude, Birgit, and Nolfavrell, Birgit’s son,
arrived, Roran jumped off the boulder and said, “We have to wait for Mandel; he’ll be joining us.”
“What for?” demanded Loring.
Birgit frowned as well. “I thought we agreed no one else should accom-pany us. Especially not Mandel,
since he was seen in Narda. It’s dangerous enough having you and Gertrude along, and Mandel only
increases the odds that someone will recognize us.”
“I’ll risk it.” Roran met each of their eyes in turn. “He needs to come.” In the end, they listened to him,
and, with Mandel, the six of them headed south, toward Teirm.
TEIRM

In that area, the coastline was composed of low, rolling hills verdant with lush grass and occasional
briars, willows, and poplars. The soft, muddy ground gave under their feet and made walking difficult. To
their right lay the glittering sea. To their left ran the purple outline of the Spine. The ranks of snowcapped
mountains were laced with clouds and mist.
As Roran’s company wended past the properties surrounding Teirm— some freehold farms, others
massive estates—they made every effort to go undetected. When they encountered the road that
connected Narda to Teirm, they darted across it and continued farther east, toward the mountains, for
several more miles before turning south again. Once they were confident they had circumnavigated the
city, they angled back to-ward the ocean until they found the southern road in.
During his time on the Red Boar, it had occurred to Roran that officials in Narda might have deduced
that whoever killed the two guards was among the men who left upon Clovis’s barges. If so, messengers
would have warned Teirm’s soldiers to watch for anyone matching the villagers’ descriptions. And if the
Ra’zac had visited Narda, then the soldiers would also know that they were looking not just for a handful
of murderers but Roran Stronghammer and the refugees from Carvahall. Teirm could be one huge trap.
Yet they could not bypass the city, for the villagers needed supplies and a new mode of transportation.
Roran had decided that their best precaution against capture was to send no one into Teirm who had
been seen in Narda, except for Gertrude and himself—Gertrude because only she understood the
ingre-dients for her medicines, and Roran because, though he was the most likely to be recognized, he

Page 603

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

trusted no one else to do what was required. He knew he possessed the will to act when others
hesitated, like the time he slew the guards. The rest of the group was chosen to minimize suspicion.
Loring was old but a tough fighter and an excellent liar. Birgit had proven herself canny and strong, and
her son, Nolfavrell, had already killed a soldier in combat, despite his tender age. Hopefully, they would
appear as nothing more than an extended family traveling together. That is, if Mandel doesn’t throw the
scheme awry, thought Roran.
It was also Roran’s idea to enter Teirm from the south, and thus make it seem even more unlikely that
they had come from Narda.
Evening was nigh when Teirm came into view, white and ghostly in the gloaming. Roran stopped to
inspect what lay before them. The walled city stood alone upon the edge of a large bay, self-contained
and impreg-nable to any conceivable attack. Torches glowed between the merlons on the battlements,
where soldiers with bows patrolled their endless circuits. Above the walls rose a citadel, and then a
faceted lighthouse, which swept its hazy beam across the dark waters.
“It’s so big,” said Nolfavrell.
Loring bobbed his head without taking his eyes off Teirm. “Aye, that it is.”
Roran’s attention was caught by a ship moored at one of the stone piers jutting from the city. The
three-masted vessel was larger than any he had seen in Narda, with a high forecastle, two banks of
oarlocks, and twelve powerful ballistae mounted along each side of the deck for shooting jave-lins. The
magnificent craft appeared equally suited for either commerce or war. Even more importantly, Roran
thought that it might— might—be able to hold the entire village.
“That’s what we need,” he said, pointing.
Birgit uttered a sour grunt. “We’d have to sell ourselves into slavery to afford passage on that monster.”
Clovis had warned them that Teirm’s portcullis closed at sunset, so they quickened their pace to avoid
spending the night in the countryside. As they neared the pale walls, the road filled with a double stream
of people hurrying to and from Teirm.
Roran had not anticipated so much traffic, but he soon realized that it could help shield his party from
unwanted attention. Beckoning to Mandel, Roran said, “Drop back a ways and follow someone else
through the gate, so the guards don’t think you’re with us. We’ll wait for you on the other side. If they
ask, you’ve come here seeking employment as a seaman.”
“Yes, sir.”
As Mandel fell behind, Roran hunched one shoulder, allowed a limp to creep into his walk, and began to
rehearse the story Loring had concocted to explain their presence at Teirm. He stepped off the road and
ducked his head as a man drove a pair of lumbering oxen past, grateful for the shadows that concealed
his features.
The gate loomed ahead, washed in uncertain orange from the torches placed in sconces on each side of
the entrance. Underneath stood a pair of soldiers with Galbatorix’s twisting flame stitched onto the front
of their crimson tunics. Neither of the armed men so much as glanced at Roran and his companions as
they shuffled underneath the spiked port-cullis and through the short tunnel beyond.

Page 604

Roran squared his shoulders and felt some of his tension ease. He and the others clustered by the corner
of a house, where Loring murmured, “So far, so good.”
When Mandel rejoined them, they set out to find an inexpensive hostel where they could let a room. As
they walked, Roran studied the layout of the city with its fortified houses—which grew progressively
higher to-ward the citadel—and the gridlike arrangement of streets. Those north to south radiated from
the citadel like a starburst, while those east to west curved gently across and formed a spiderweb
pattern, creating numerous places where barriers could be erected and soldiers stationed.
If Carvahall had been built like this,he thought, no one could have de-feated us but the king himself.
By dusk they had acquired lodging at the Green Chestnut, an exceed-ingly vile tavern with atrocious ale
and flea-infested beds. Its sole advan-tage was that it cost next to nothing. They went to sleep without
dinner to save their precious coin, and huddled together to prevent their purses from being filched by one
of the tavern’s other guests.
The next day, Roran and his companions left the Green Chestnut be-fore dawn to search for provisions
and transportation.
Gertrude said, “I have heard tell of a remarkable herbalist, Angela by name, who lives here and is
supposed to work the most amazing cures, perhaps even a touch of magic. I would go see her, for if
anyone has what I seek, it would be she.”
“You shouldn’t go alone,” said Roran. He looked at Mandel. “Accom-pany Gertrude, help her with her
purchases, and do your best to protect her if you are attacked. Your nerve may be tested at times, but
do noth-ing to cause alarm, unless you would betray your friends and family.”
Mandel touched his forelock and nodded his obedience. He and Gertrude departed at right angles down
a cross street, while Roran and the rest resumed their hunt.
Roran had the patience of a stalking predator, but even he began to thrum with restlessness when
morning and afternoon slipped by and they still had not found a ship to carry them to Surda. He learned
that the three-masted ship, the Dragon Wing, was newly built and about to be launched on her maiden
voyage; that they had no chance of hiring it from the Blackmoor Shipping Company unless they could
pay a roomful of the dwarves’ red gold; and indeed, that the villagers lacked the coin to engage even the
meanest vessel. Nor would taking Clovis’s barges solve their problems, because it still left unanswered
the question of what they would eat on their trek.
“It would be hard,” said Birgit, “very hard, to steal goods from this place, what with all the soldiers and
how close together the houses are and the watchmen at the gate. If we tried to cart that much stuff out of
Teirm, they’d want to know what we were doing.”
Roran nodded. That too.
Roran had suggested to Horst that if the villagers were forced to flee Teirm with naught but their
remaining supplies, they could raid for their food. However, Roran knew that such an act would mean
they had be-come as monstrous as those he hated. He had no stomach for it. It was one thing to fight and
kill those who served Galbatorix—or even to steal Clovis’s barges, since Clovis had other means of
supporting himself—but it was quite another to take provisions from innocent farmers who strug-gled to
survive as much as the villagers had in Palancar Valley. That would be murder.

Page 605

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Those hard facts weighed upon Roran like stones. Their venture had always been tenuous at best,
sustained in equal parts by fear, desperation, optimism, and last-minute improvisation. Now he feared
that he had driven the villagers into the den of their enemies and bound them in place with a chain forged
of their own poverty. I could escape alone and continue my search for Katrina, but what victory
would that be if I left my village to be enslaved by the Empire? Whatever our fate in Teirm, I will
stand firm with those who trusted me enough to forsake their homes upon my word.
To relieve their hunger, they stopped at a bakery and bought a loaf of fresh rye bread, as well as a small
pot of honey to slather it with. While he paid for the items, Loring mentioned to the baker’s assistant that
they were in the market for ships, equipment, and food.
At a tap on his shoulder, Roran turned. A man with coarse black hair and a thick slab of belly said,
“Pardon me for overhearing your parley with the young master, but if it’s ships and such you be after, and
at a fair price, then I should guess you’d want to attend the auction.”
“What auction is this?” asked Roran.
“Ah, it’s a sad story, it is, but all too common nowadays. One of our merchants, Jeod—Jeod
Longshanks, as we call him out of hearing—has had the most abominable run of bad luck. In less than a
year, he lost four of his ships, an’ when he tried to send his goods over land, the caravan was ambushed
and destroyed by some thieving outlaws. His investors forced him to declare bankruptcy, and now
they’re going to sell his prop-erty to recoup their losses. I don’t know ’bout food, but you’d be sure to
find most everything else you’re looking to buy at the auction.”
A faint ember of hope kindled in Roran’s breast. “When will the auc-tion be held?”
“Why, it’s posted on every message board throughout the city. Day after tomorrow, to be sure.”
That explained to Roran why they had not learned of the auction before; they had done their best to
avoid the message boards, on the off chance that someone would recognize Roran from the portrait on
his reward poster.
“Thank you much,” he said to the man. “You may have saved us a great deal of trouble.”
“My pleasure, so it is.”
Once Roran and his companions filed out of the shop, they huddled together on the edge of the street.
He said, “Do you think we should look into this?”
“It’s all we have to look into,” growled Loring.
“Birgit?”
“You needn’t ask me; it’s obvious. We cannot wait until the day after tomorrow, though.”
“No. I say we meet with this Jeod and see if we can strike a bargain with him before the auction opens.
Are we agreed?”
They were, and so they set out for Jeod’s house, armed with directions from a passerby. The house—or
rather, mansion—was set on the west side of Teirm, close to the citadel, among scores of other opulent
build-ings embellished with fine scrollwork, wrought-iron gates, statues, and gushing fountains. Roran

Page 606

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

could scarcely comprehend such riches; it amazed him how different the lives of these people were from
his own.
Roran knocked on the front door to Jeod’s mansion, which stood next to an abandoned shop. After a
moment, the door was pulled open by a plump butler garnished with overly shiny teeth. He eyed the four
strang-ers upon his doorstep with disapproval, then flashed his glazed smile and asked, “How may I help
you, sirs and madam?”
“We would talk with Jeod, if he is free.”
“Have you an appointment?”
Roran thought the butler knew perfectly well that they did not. “Our stay in Teirm is too brief for us to
arrange a proper meeting.”
“Ah, well, then I regret to say that your time would have been better spent elsewhere. My master has
many matters to tend. He cannot devote himself to every group of ragged tramps that bangs on his door,
asking for handouts,” said the butler. He exposed even more of his glassy teeth and began to withdraw
inside.
“Wait!” cried Roran. “It’s not handouts we want; we have a business proposition for Jeod.”
The butler lifted one eyebrow. “Is that so?”
“Aye, it is. Please ask him if he will hear us. We’ve traveled more leagues than you’d care to know, and
it’s imperative we see Jeod today.”
“May I inquire as to the nature of your proposition?”
“It’s confidential.”
“Very well, sir,” said the butler. “I will convey your offer, but I warn you that Jeod is occupied at the
moment, and I doubt he will wish to bother himself. By what name shall I announce you, sir?”
“You may call me Stronghammer.” The butler’s mouth twitched as if amused by the name, then slipped
behind the door and closed it.
“If his head were any larger, ’e couldn’t fit in the privy,” muttered Lor-ing out the side of his mouth.
Nolfavrell uttered a bark of laughter at the insult.
Birgit said, “Let’s hope the servant doesn’t imitate the master.”
A minute later, the door reopened and the butler announced, with a rather brittle expression, “Jeod has
agreed to meet you in the study.” He moved to the side and gestured with one arm for them to proceed.
“This way.” After they trooped into the sumptuous entryway, the butler swept past them and down a
polished wood hallway to one door among many, which he opened and ushered them through.
JEOD LONGSHANKS

Page 607

If Roran had known how to read, he might have been more impressed by the treasure trove of books
that lined the study walls. As it was, he reserved his attention for the tall man with graying hair who stood
be-hind an oval writing desk. The man—who Roran assumed was Jeod— looked about as tired as
Roran felt. His face was lined, careworn, and sad, and when he turned toward them, a nasty scar
gleamed white from his scalp to his left temple. To Roran, it bespoke steel in the man. Long and buried,
perhaps, but steel nevertheless.
“Do sit,” said Jeod. “I won’t stand on ceremony in my own house.” He watched them with curious eyes
as they settled in the soft leather arm-chairs. “May I offer you pastries and a glass of apricot brandy? I
cannot talk for long, but I see you’ve been on the road for many a week, and I well remember how dusty
my throat was after such journeys.”
Loring grinned. “Aye. A touch of brandy would be welcome indeed. You’re most generous, sir.”
“Only a glass of milk for my boy,” said Birgit.
“Of course, madam.” Jeod rang for the butler, delivered his instructions, then leaned back in his chair. “I
am at a disadvantage. I believe you have my name, but I don’t have yours.”
“Stronghammer, at your service,” said Roran.
“Mardra, at your service,” said Birgit.
“Kell, at your service,” said Nolfavrell.
“And I’d be Wally, at your service,” finished Loring.
“And I at yours,” responded Jeod. “Now, Rolf mentioned that you wished to do business with me. It’s
only fair that you know I’m in no po-sition to buy or sell goods, nor have I gold for investing, nor proud
ships to carry wool and food, gems and spices across the restless sea. What, then, can I do for you?”
Roran rested his elbows on his knees, then knitted his fingers together and stared between them as he
marshaled his thoughts. A slip of the tongue could kill us here, he reminded himself. “To put it simply,
sir, we represent a certain group of people who—for various reasons—must purchase a large amount of
supplies with very little money. We know that your belongings will be auctioned off day after tomorrow
to repay your debts, and we would like to offer a bid now on those items we need. We would have
waited until the auction, but circumstances press us and we cannot tarry another two days. If we are to
strike a bargain, it must be tonight or tomorrow, no later.”
“What manner of supplies do you need?” asked Jeod.
“Food and whatever else is required to outfit a ship or other vessel for a long voyage at sea.”
A spark of interest gleamed in Jeod’s weary face. “Do you have a certain ship in mind? For I know
every craft that’s plied these waters in the last twenty years.”
“We’ve yet to decide.”
Jeod accepted that without question. “I understand now why you thought to come to me, but I fear you
labor under a misapprehension.” He spread his gray hands, indicating the room. “Everything you see here
no longer belongs to me, but to my creditors. I have no authority to sell my possessions, and if I did so

Page 608

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

without permission, I would likely be im-prisoned for cheating my creditors out of the money I owe
them.”
He paused as Rolf backed into the study, carrying a large silver tray dotted with pastries, cut-crystal
goblets, a glass of milk, and a decanter of brandy. The butler placed the tray on a padded footstool and
then pro-ceeded to serve the refreshments. Roran took his goblet and sipped the mellow brandy,
wondering how soon courtesy would allow the four of them to excuse themselves and resume their quest.
When Rolf left the room, Jeod drained his goblet with a single draught, then said, “I may be of no use to
you, but I do know a number of people in my profession who might... might... be able to help. If you can
give me a bit more detail about what you want to buy, then I’d have a better idea of who to
recommend.”
Roran saw no harm in that, so he began to recite a list of items the vil-lagers had to have, things they
might need, and things they wanted but would never be able to afford unless fortune smiled greatly upon
them. Now and then Birgit or Loring mentioned something Roran had forgot-ten—like lamp oil—and
Jeod would glance at them for a moment before returning his hooded gaze to Roran, where it remained
with growing in-tensity. Jeod’s interest concerned Roran; it was as if the merchant knew, or suspected,
what he was hiding.
“It seems to me,” said Jeod at the completion of Roran’s inventory, “that this would be enough
provisions to transport several hundred people to Feinster or Aroughs... or beyond. Admittedly, I’ve
been rather occupied for the past few weeks, but I’ve heard of no such host in this area, nor can I
imagine where one might have come from.”
His face blank, Roran met Jeod’s stare and said nothing. On the inside, he seethed with self-contempt
for allowing Jeod to amass enough infor-mation to reach that conclusion.
Jeod shrugged. “Well, be as it may, that’s your own concern. I’d suggest that you see Galton on Market
Street about your food and old Hamill by the docks for all else. They’re both honest men and will treat
you true and fair.” Reaching over, he plucked a pastry from the tray, took a bite, and then, when he
finished chewing, asked Nolfavrell, “So, young Kell, have you enjoyed your stay in Teirm?”
“Yes, sir,” said Nolfavrell, and grinned. “I’ve never seen anything quite so large, sir.”
“Is that so?”
“Yes, sir. I—”
Feeling that they were in dangerous territory, Roran interrupted: “I’m curious, sir, as to the nature of the
shop next to your house. It seems odd to have such a humble store among all these grand buildings.”
For the first time, a smile, if only a small one, brightened Jeod’s expres-sion, erasing years from his
appearance. “Well, it was owned by a woman who was a bit odd herself: Angela the herbalist, one of the
best healers I’ve ever met. She tended that store for twenty-some years and then, only a few months
ago, up and sold it and left for parts unknown.” He sighed. “It’s a pity, for she made an interesting
neighbor.”
“That’s who Gertrude wanted to meet, isn’t it?” asked Nolfavrell, and looked up at his mother.
Roran suppressed a snarl and flashed a warning glance strong enough to make Nolfavrell quail in his

chair. The name would mean nothing to Jeod, but unless Nolfavrell guarded his tongue better, he was
liable to blurt out something far more damaging. Time to go, thought Roran. He put down his goblet.
It was then that he saw the name did mean something to Jeod. The merchant’s eyes widened with
surprise, and he gripped the arms of his chair until the tips of his fingers turned bone white. “It can’t be!”
Jeod fo-cused on Roran, studying his face as if trying to see past the beard, and then breathed, “Roran...
Roran Garrowsson.”
AN UNEXPECTED ALLY

Roran had already pulled his hammer from his belt and was halfway out of the chair when he heard his
father’s name. It was the only thing that kept him from leaping across the room and knocking Jeod
uncon-scious. How does he know who Garrow is? Beside him, Loring and Birgit jumped to their feet,
drawing knives from within their sleeves, and even Nolfavrell readied himself to fight with a dagger in
hand.
“It is Roran, isn’t it?” Jeod asked quietly. He showed no alarm at their weapons.
“How did you guess?”
“Because Brom brought Eragon here, and you look like your cousin. When I saw your poster with
Eragon’s, I realized that the Empire must have tried to capture you and that you had escaped. Although,”
Jeod’s gaze drifted to the other three, “in all my imaginings, I never suspected that you took the rest of
Carvahall with you.”
Stunned, Roran dropped back into his chair and placed the hammer across his knees, ready for use.
“Eragon was here?”
“Aye. And Saphira too.”
“Saphira?”
Again, surprise crossed Jeod’s face. “You don’t know, then?”
“Know what?”
Jeod considered him for a long minute. “I think the time has come to drop our pretenses, Roran
Garrowsson, and talk openly and without de-ception. I can answer many of the questions you must
have—such as why the Empire is pursuing you—but in return, I need to know the rea-son you came to
Teirm... the real reason.”
“An’ why should we trust you, Longshanks?” demanded Loring. “You could be working for Galbatorix,
you could.”
“I was Brom’s friend for over twenty years, before he was a storyteller in Carvahall,” said Jeod, “and I
did my best to help him and Eragon when they were under my roof. But since neither of them are here to
vouch for me, I place my life in your hands, to do with as you wish. I could shout for help, but I won’t.
Nor will I fight you. All I ask is that you tell me your story and hear my own. Then you can decide for
yourself what course of action is proper. You’re in no immediate danger, so what harm is there in

talking?”
Birgit caught Roran’s eye with a flick of her chin. “He could just be try-ing to save his hide.”
“Maybe,” replied Roran, “but we have to find out whatever it is he knows.” Hooking an arm underneath
his chair, he dragged it across the room, placed the back of the chair against the door, and then sat in it,
so that no one could burst in and catch them unawares. He jabbed his hammer at Jeod. “All right. You
want to talk? Then let us talk, you and I.”
“It would be best if you go first.”
“If I do, and we’re not satisfied by your answers afterward, we’ll have to kill you,” warned Roran.
Jeod folded his arms. “So be it.”
Despite himself, Roran was impressed by the merchant’s fortitude; Jeod appeared unconcerned by his
fate, if a bit grim about the mouth. “So be it,” Roran echoed.
Roran had relived the events since the Ra’zac’s arrival in Carvahall often enough, but never before had
he described them in detail to another per-son. As he did, it struck him how much had happened to him
and the other villagers in such a short time and how easy it had been for the Em-pire to destroy their lives
in Palancar Valley. Resuscitating old terrors was painful for Roran, but he at least had the pleasure of
seeing Jeod exhibit unfeigned astonishment as he heard about how the villagers had rousted the soldiers
and Ra’zac from their camp, the siege of Carvahall thereafter, Sloan’s treachery, Katrina’s kidnapping,
how Roran had convinced the vil-lagers to flee, and the hardships of their journey to Teirm.
“By the Lost Kings!” exclaimed Jeod. “That’s the most extraordinary tale. Extraordinary! To think
you’ve managed to thwart Galbatorix and that right now the entire village of Carvahall is hiding outside
one of the Empire’s largest cities and the king doesn’t even know it....” He shook his head with
admiration.
“Aye, that’s our position,” growled Loring, “and it’s precarious at best, so you’d better explain well and
good why we should risk letting you live.”
“It places me in as much—”
Jeod stopped as someone rattled the latch behind Roran’s chair, trying to open the door, followed by
pounding on the oak planks. In the hall-way, a woman cried, “Jeod! Let me in, Jeod! You can’t hide in
that cave of yours.”
“May I?” murmured Jeod.
Roran clicked his fingers at Nolfavrell, and the boy tossed his dagger to Roran, who slipped around the
writing desk and pressed the flat of the blade against Jeod’s throat. “Make her leave.”
Raising his voice, Jeod said, “I can’t talk now; I’m in the middle of a meeting.”
“Liar! You don’t have any business. You’re bankrupt! Come out and face me, you coward! Are you a
man or not that you won’t even look your wife in the eye?” She paused for a second, as if expecting a
response, then her screeches increased in volume: “Coward! You’re a gutless rat, a filthy, yellow-bellied
sheep-biter without the common sense to run a meat stall, much less a shipping company. My father

Page 611

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

would have never lost so much money!”
Roran winced as the insults continued. I can’t restrain Jeod if she goes on much longer.
“Be still, woman!” commanded Jeod, and silence ensued. “Our fortunes might be about to change for
the better if you but have the sense to re-strain your tongue and not rail on like a fishmonger’s wife.”
Her answer was cold: “I shall wait upon your pleasure in the dining room, dear husband, and unless you
choose to attend me by the evening meal and explain yourself, then I shall leave this accursed house,
never to return.” The sound of her footsteps retreated into the distance.
When he was sure that she was gone, Roran lifted the dagger from Jeod’s neck and returned the
weapon to Nolfavrell before reseating him-self in the chair pushed against the door.
Jeod rubbed his neck and then, with a wry expression, said, “If we don’t reach an understanding, you
had better kill me; it’d be easier than ex-plaining to Helen that I shouted at her for naught.”
“You have my sympathy, Longshanks,” said Loring.
“It’s not her fault... not really. She just doesn’t understand why so much misfortune has befallen us.”
Jeod sighed. “Perhaps it’s my fault for not dar-ing to tell her.”
“Tell her what?” piped Nolfavrell.
“That I’m an agent for the Varden.” Jeod paused at their dumbfounded expressions. “Perhaps I should
start from the beginning. Roran, have you heard rumors in the past few months of the existence of a new
Rider who opposes Galbatorix?”
“Mutterings here and there, yes, but nothing I’d give credence to.”
Jeod hesitated. “I don’t know how else to say this, Roran... but there is a new Rider in Alagaësia, and
it’s your cousin, Eragon. The stone he found in the Spine was actually a dragon egg I helped the Varden
steal from Galbatorix years ago. The dragon hatched for Eragon and he named her Saphira. That is why
the Ra’zac first came to Palancar Valley. They re-turned because Eragon has become a formidable
enemy of the Empire and Galbatorix hoped that by capturing you, they could bring Eragon to bay.”
Roran threw back his head and howled with laughter until tears gath-ered at the corners of his eyes and
his stomach hurt from the convulsions. Loring, Birgit, and Nolfavrell looked at him with something akin to
fear, but Roran cared not for their opinions. He laughed at the absurdity of Jeod’s assertion. He laughed
at the terrible possibility that Jeod had told the truth.
Taking rasping breaths, Roran gradually returned to normal, despite an occasional outburst of humorless
chuckles. He wiped his face on his sleeve and then regarded Jeod, a hard smile upon his lips. “It fits the
facts; I’ll give you that. But so do a half dozen other explanations I’ve thought of.”
Birgit said, “If Eragon’s stone was a dragon egg, then where did it come from?”
“Ah,” replied Jeod, “now there’s an affair I’m well acquainted with....”
Comfortable in his chair, Roran listened with disbelief as Jeod spun a fantastic story of how
Brom—grumpy old Brom!—had once been a Rider and had supposedly helped establish the Varden,

Page 612

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

how Jeod had discov-ered a secret passageway into Urû’baen, how the Varden arranged to filch the last
three dragon eggs from Galbatorix, and how only one egg was saved after Brom fought and killed
Morzan of the Forsworn. As if that were not preposterous enough, Jeod went on to describe an
agreement between the Varden, dwarves, and elves that the egg should be ferried between Du
Weldenvarden and the Beor Mountains, which was why the egg and its couriers were near the edge of
the great forest when they were ambushed by a Shade.
A Shade—ha!thought Roran.
Skeptical as he was, Roran attended with redoubled interest when Jeod began to talk of Eragon finding
the egg and raising the dragon Saphira in the forest by Garrow’s farm. Roran had been occupied at the
time— preparing to leave for Dempton’s mill in Therinsford—but he remem-bered how distracted
Eragon had been, how he spent every moment he could outdoors, doing who knows what....
As Jeod explained how and why Garrow died, rage filled Roran that Eragon had dared keep the dragon
secret when it so obviously put every-one in danger. It’s his fault my father died!
“What was he thinking?” burst out Roran.
He hated how Jeod looked at him with calm understanding. “I doubt Eragon knew himself. Riders and
their dragons are bound together so closely, it’s often hard to differentiate one from the other. Eragon
could have no more harmed Saphira than he could have sawed off his own leg.”
“He could have,” muttered Roran. “Because of him, I’ve had to do things just as painful, and I
know—he could have.”
“You’ve a right to feel as you do,” said Jeod, “but don’t forget that the reason Eragon left Palancar
Valley was to protect you and all who re-mained. I believe it was an extremely hard choice for him to
make. From his point of view, he sacrificed himself to ensure your safety and to avenge your father. And
while leaving may not have had the desired ef-fect, things would have certainly turned out far worse if
Eragon had stayed.”
Roran said nothing more until Jeod mentioned that the reason Brom and Eragon had visited Teirm was
to see if they could use the city’s ship-ping manifests to locate the Ra’zac’s lair. “And did they?” cried
Roran, bolting upright.
“We did indeed.”
“Well, where are they, then? For goodness’ sake, man, say it; you know how important this is to me!”
“It seemed apparent from the records—and I later had a message from the Varden that Eragon’s own
account confirmed this—that the Ra’zac’s den is in the formation known as Helgrind, by Dras-Leona.”
Roran gripped his hammer with excitement. It’s a long way to Dras-Leona, but Teirm has access to
the only open pass between here and the southern end of the Spine. If I can get everyone safely
heading down the coast, then I could go to this Helgrind, rescue Katrina if she’s there, and fol-low
the Jiet River down to Surda.
Something of Roran’s thoughts much have revealed themselves on his face, because Jeod said, “It can’t
be done, Roran.”

Page 613

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“What?”
“No one man can take Helgrind. It’s a solid, bare, black mountain of stone that’s impossible to climb.
Consider the Ra’zac’s foul steeds; it seems likely they would have an eyrie near the top of Helgrind
rather than bed near the ground, where they are most vulnerable. How, then, would you reach them?
And if you could, do you really believe that you could defeat both Ra’zac and their two steeds, if not
more? I have no doubt you are a fearsome warrior—after all, you and Eragon share blood—but these
are foes beyond any normal human.”
Roran shook his head. “I can’t abandon Katrina. It may be futile, but I must try to free her, even if it
costs me my life.”
“It won’t do Katrina any good if you get yourself killed,” admonished Jeod. “If I may offer a bit of
advice: try to reach Surda as you’ve planned. Once there, I’m sure you can enlist Eragon’s help. Even
the Ra’zac cannot match a Rider and dragon in open combat.”
In his mind’s eye, Roran saw the huge gray-skinned beasts the Ra’zac rode upon. He was loath to
acknowledge it, but he knew that such creatures were beyond his ability to kill, no matter the strength of
his motiva-tion. The instant he accepted that truth, Roran finally believed Jeod’s tale—for if he did not,
Katrina was forever lost to him.
Eragon,he thought. Eragon! By the blood I’ve spilled and the gore on my hands, I swear upon my
father’s grave I’ll have you atone for what you’ve done by storming Helgrind with me. If you
created this mess, then I’ll have you clean it up.
Roran motioned to Jeod. “Continue your account. Let us hear the rest of this sorry play before the day
grows much older.”
Then Jeod spoke of Brom’s death; of Murtagh, son of Morzan; of cap-ture and escape in Gil’ead; of a
desperate flight to save an elf; of Urgals and dwarves and a great battle in a place called Farthen Dûr,
where Er-agon defeated a Shade. And Jeod told them how the Varden left the Beor Mountains for
Surda and how Eragon was even now deep within Du Weldenvarden, learning the elves’ mysterious
secrets of magic and war-fare, but would soon return.
When the merchant fell silent, Roran gathered at the far end of the study with Loring, Birgit, and
Nolfavrell and asked their thoughts. Lower-ing his voice, Loring said, “I can’t tell whether he’s lying or
not, but any man who can weave a yarn like that at knifepoint deserves to live. A new Rider! And
Eragon to boot!” He shook his head.
“Birgit?” asked Roran.
“I don’t know. It’s so outlandish....” She hesitated. “But it must be true. Another Rider is the only thing
that would spur the Empire to pursue us so fiercely.”
“Aye,” agreed Loring. His eyes were bright with excitement. “We’ve been entangled in far more
momentous events than we realized. A new Rider. Just think about it! The old order is about to be
washed away, I tell you.... You were right all along, Roran.”
“Nolfavrell?”
The boy looked solemn at being asked. He bit his lip, then said, “Jeod seems honest enough. I think we

Page 614

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

can trust him.”
“Right, then,” said Roran. He strode back to Jeod, planted his knuckles on the edge of the desk, and
said, “Two last questions, Longshanks. What do Brom and Eragon look like? And how did you
recognize Gertrude’s name?”
“I knew of Gertrude because Brom mentioned that he left a letter for you in her care. As for what they
looked like: Brom stood a bit shorter than me. He had a thick beard, a hooked nose, and he carried a
carved staff with him. And I dare say he was rather irritable at times.” Roran nodded; that was Brom.
“Eragon was... young. Brown hair, brown eyes, with a scar on his wrist, and he never stopped asking
questions.” Roran nodded again; that was his cousin.
Roran stuck his hammer back under his belt. Birgit, Loring, and Nol-favrell sheathed their blades. Then
Roran pulled his chair away from the door, and the four of them resumed their seats like civilized beings.
“What now, Jeod?” asked Roran. “Can you help us? I know you’re in a difficult situation, but we... we
are desperate and have no one else to turn to. As an agent of the Varden, can you guarantee us the
Varden’s protec-tion? We are willing to serve them if they’ll shield us from Galbatorix’s wrath.”
“The Varden,” said Jeod, “would be more than happy to have you. More than happy. I suspect you
already guessed that. As for help...” He ran a hand down his long face and stared past Loring at the rows
of books on the shelves. “I’ve been aware for almost a year that my true identity— as well as that of
many other merchants here and elsewhere who have assisted the Varden—was betrayed to the Empire.
Because of that, I ha-ven’t dared flee to Surda. If I tried, the Empire would arrest me, and then who
knows what horrors I’d be in for? I’ve had to watch the gradual de-struction of my business without
being able to take any action to oppose or escape it. What’s worse, now that I cannot ship anything to
the Varden and they dare not send envoys to me, I feared that Lord Risthart would have me clapped in
irons and dragged off to the dungeons, since I’m of no further interest to the Empire. I’ve expected it
every day since I declared bankruptcy.”
“Perhaps,” suggested Birgit, “they want you to flee so they can capture whoever else you bring with
you.”
Jeod smiled. “Perhaps. But now that you are here, I have a means to leave that they never anticipated.”
“Then you have a plan?” asked Loring.
Glee crossed Jeod’s face. “Oh yes, I have a plan. Did the four of you see the ship Dragon Wing
moored at port?”
Roran thought back to the vessel. “Aye.”
“The Dragon Wing is owned by the Blackmoor Shipping Company, a front for the Empire. They handle
supplies for the army, which has mo-bilized to an alarming degree recently, conscripting soldiers among
the peasants and commandeering horses, asses, and oxen.” Jeod raised an eye-brow. “I’m not sure what
it indicates, but it’s possible Galbatorix means to march on Surda. In any case, the Dragon Wing is to
sail for Feinster within the week. She’s the finest ship ever built, from a new design by master shipwright
Kinnell.”
“And you want to pirate her,” concluded Roran.
“I do. Not only to spite the Empire or because the Dragon Wing is re-puted to be the fastest

Page 615

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

square-rigged ship of her tonnage, but because she’s already fully provisioned for a long voyage. And
since her cargo is food, we’d have enough for the whole village.”
Loring uttered a strained cackle. “I ’ope you can sail her yourself, Long-shanks, ’cause not one of us
knows how to handle anything larger than a barge.”
“A few men from the crews of my ships are still in Teirm. They’re in the same position I am, unable to
fight or flee. I’m confident they’ll jump at a chance to get to Surda. They can teach you what to do on
the Dragon Wing. It won’t be easy, but I don’t see much choice in the matter.”
Roran grinned. The plan was to his liking: swift, decisive, and unex-pected.
“You mentioned,” said Birgit, “that in the past year none of your ships— nor those from other merchants
who serve the Varden—have reached their destination. Why, then, should this mission succeed when so
many have failed?”
Jeod was quick to answer: “Because surprise is on our side. The law re-quires merchant ships to submit
their itinerary for approval with the port authority at least two weeks before departure. It takes a great
deal of time to prepare a ship for launch, so if we leave without warning, it could be a week or more
before Galbatorix can launch intercept vessels. If luck is with us, we won’t see so much as the topmast of
our pursuers. So,” continued Jeod, “if you are willing to attempt this enterprise, this is what we must
do....”
ESCAPE

After they considered Jeod’s proposal from every possible angle and agreed to abide by it—with a few
modifications—Roran sent Nolfavrell to fetch Gertrude and Mandel from the Green Chestnut, for Jeod
had of-fered their entire party his hospitality.
“Now, if you will excuse me,” said Jeod, rising, “I must go reveal to my wife that which I should never
have hidden from her and ask if she’ll ac-company me to Surda. You may take your pick of rooms on
the second floor. Rolf will summon you when supper is ready.” With long, slow steps, he departed the
study.
“Is it wise to let him tell that ogress?” asked Loring.
Roran shrugged. “Wise or not, we can’t stop him. And I don’t think he’ll be at peace until he does.”
Instead of going to a room, Roran wandered through the mansion, un-consciously evading the servants
as he pondered the things Jeod had said. He stopped at a bay window open to the stables at the rear of
the house and filled his lungs with the brisk and smoky air, heavy with the familiar smell of manure.
“Do you hate him?”
He started and turned to see Birgit silhouetted in the doorway. She pulled her shawl tight around her
shoulders as she approached.
“Who?” he asked, knowing full well.

Page 616

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“Eragon. Do you hate him?”
Roran looked at the darkening sky. “I don’t know. I hate him for caus-ing the death of my father, but
he’s still family and for that I love him.... I suppose that if I didn’t need Eragon to save Katrina, I would
have nothing to do with him for a long while yet.”
“As I need and hate you, Stronghammer.”
He snorted with grim amusement. “Aye, we’re joined at the hip, aren’t we? You have to help me find
Eragon in order to avenge Quimby on the Ra’zac.”
“And to have my vengeance on you afterward.”
“That too.” Roran stared into her unwavering eyes for a moment, ac-knowledging the bond between
them. He found it strangely comforting to know that they shared the same drive, the same angry fire that
quick-ened their steps when others faltered. In her, he recognized a kindred spirit.
Returning through the house, Roran stopped by the dining room as he heard the cadence of Jeod’s
voice. Curious, he fit his eye to a crack by the middle door hinge. Jeod stood opposite a slight, blond
woman, who Ro-ran assumed was Helen.
“If what you say is true, how can you expect me to trust you?”
“I cannot,” answered Jeod.
“Yet you ask me to become a fugitive for you?”
“You once offered to leave your family and wander the land with me. You begged me to spirit you away
from Teirm.”
“Once. I thought you were terribly dashing then, what with your sword and your scar.”
“I still have those,” he said softly. “I made many mistakes with you, Helen; I understand that now. But I
still love you and want you to be safe. I have no future here. If I stay, I’ll only bring grief to your family.
You can return to your father or you can come with me. Do what will make you the happiest. However, I
beg you to give me a second chance, to have the courage to leave this place and shed the bitter
memories of our life here. We can start anew in Surda.”
She was quiet for a long time. “That young man who was here, is he really a Rider?”
“He is. The winds of change are blowing, Helen. The Varden are about to attack, the dwarves are
gathering, and even the elves stir in their an-cient haunts. War approaches, and if we’re fortunate, so
does Galbatorix’s downfall.”
“Are you important among the Varden?”
“They owe me some consideration for my part in acquiring Saphira’s egg.”
“Then you would have a position with them in Surda?”
“I imagine so.” He put his hands on her shoulders, and she did not draw away.

Page 617

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

She whispered, “Jeod, Jeod, don’t press me. I cannot decide yet.”
“Will you think about it?”
She shivered. “Oh yes. I’ll think about it.”
Roran’s heart pained him as he left.
Katrina.
That night at dinner, Roran noticed Helen’s eyes were often upon him, studying and
measuring—comparing him, he was sure, to Eragon.
After the meal, Roran beckoned to Mandel and led him out into the courtyard behind the house.
“What is it, sir?” asked Mandel.
“I wished to talk with you in private.”
“About what?”
Roran fingered the pitted blade of his hammer and reflected on how much he felt like Garrow when his
father gave a lecture on responsibil-ity; Roran could even feel the same phrases rising in his throat. And
so one generation passes to the next, he thought. “You’ve become quite friendly with the sailors as of
late.”
“They’re not our enemies,” objected Mandel.
“Everyone is an enemy at this point. Clovis and his men could turn on us in an instant. It wouldn’t be a
problem, though, if being with them hadn’t caused you to neglect your duties.” Mandel stiffened and
color bloomed in his cheeks, but he did not lower himself in Roran’s esteem by denying the charge.
Pleased, Roran asked, “What is the most important thing we can do right now, Mandel?”
“Protect our families.”
“Aye. And what else?”
Mandel hesitated, uncertain, then confessed, “I don’t know.”
“Help one another. It’s the only way any of us are going to survive. I was especially disappointed to
learn that you’ve gambled food with the sailors, since that endangers the entire village. Your time would
be far better spent hunting than playing games of dice or learning to throw knives. With your father gone,
it’s fallen upon you to care for your mother and siblings. They rely on you. Am I clear?”
“Very clear, sir,” replied Mandel with a choked voice.
“Will this ever happen again?”
“Never again, sir.”

Page 618

“Good. Now I didn’t bring you here just to chastise you. You show promise, which is why I’m giving
you a task that I would trust to no one else but myself.”
“Yes, sir!”
“Tomorrow morning I need you to return to camp and deliver a mes-sage to Horst. Jeod believes the
Empire has spies watching this house, so it’s vital that you make sure you aren’t followed. Wait until
you’re out of the city, then lose whoever is trailing you in the countryside. Kill him if you have to. When
you find Horst, tell him to...” As Roran outlined his instructions, he watched Mandel’s expression change
from surprise, to shock, and then to awe.
“What if Clovis objects?” asked Mandel.
“That night, break the tillers on the barges so they can’t be steered. It’s a dirty trick, but it could be
disastrous if Clovis or any of his men arrive at Teirm before you.”
“I won’t let that happen,” vowed Mandel.
Roran smiled. “Good.” Satisfied that he had resolved the matter of Mandel’s behavior and that the
young man would do everything possible to get the message to Horst, Roran went back inside and bade
their host good night before heading off to sleep.
With the exception of Mandel, Roran and his companions confined themselves to the mansion
throughout the following day, taking advan-tage of the delay to rest, hone their weapons, and review their
stratagems.
From dawn till dusk, they saw some of Helen as she bustled from one room to the next, more of Rolf
with his teeth like varnished pearls, and none of Jeod, for the gray-pated merchant had left to walk the
city and— seemingly by accident—meet with the few men of the sea whom he trusted for their
expedition.
Upon his return, he told Roran, “We can count on five more hands. I only hope it’s enough.” Jeod
remained in his study for the rest of the eve-ning, drawing up various legal documents and otherwise
tending to his affairs.
Three hours before dawn, Roran, Loring, Birgit, Gertrude, and Nol-favrell roused themselves and,
fighting back prodigious yawns, congre-gated in the mansion’s entryway, where they muffled themselves
in long cloaks to obscure their faces. A rapier hung at Jeod’s side when he joined them, and Roran
thought the narrow sword somehow completed the rangy man, as if it reminded Jeod who he really was.
Jeod lit an oil lantern and held it up before them. “Are we ready?” he asked. They nodded. Then Jeod
unlatched the door and they filed outside to the empty cobblestone street. Behind them, Jeod lingered in
the en-tryway, casting a longing gaze toward the stairs on the right, but Helen did not appear. With a
shudder, Jeod left his home and closed the door.
Roran put a hand on his arm. “What’s done is done.”
“I know.”
They trotted through the dark city, slowing to a quick walk whenever they encountered watchmen or a
fellow creature of the night, most of whom darted away at the sight of them. Once they heard footsteps

on top of a nearby building. “The design of the city,” explained Jeod, “makes it easy for thieves to climb
from one roof to another.”
They slowed to a walk again when they arrived at Teirm’s eastern gate.
Because the gate opened to the harbor, it was closed only four hours each night in order to minimize the
disruption to commerce. Indeed, despite the time, several men were already moving through the gate.
Even though Jeod had warned them it might happen, Roran still felt a surge of fear when the guards
lowered their pikes and asked what their business was. He wet his mouth and tried not to fidget while the
elder soldier examined a scroll that Jeod handed to him. After a long minute, the guard nodded and
returned the parchment. “You can pass.”
Once they were on the wharf and out of earshot of the city wall, Jeod said, “It’s a good thing he couldn’t
read.”
The six of them waited on the damp planking until, one by one, Jeod’s men emerged from the gray mist
that lay upon the shore. They were grim and silent, with braided hair that hung to the middle of their
backs, tar-smeared hands, and an assortment of scars even Roran respected. He liked what he saw, and
he could tell they approved of him as well. They did not, however, take to Birgit.
One of the sailors, a large brute of a man, jerked a thumb at her and ac-cused Jeod, “You didn’t say
there’d be a woman along for the fightin’. How am I supposed to concentrate with some backwoods
tramp getting in m’ way?”
“Don’t talk about her like that,” said Nolfavrell between clenched teeth.
“An’ her runt too?”
In a calm voice, Jeod said, “Birgit has fought the Ra’zac. And her son has already killed one of
Galbatorix’s best soldiers. Can you claim as much, Uthar?”
“It’s not proper,” said another man. “I wouldn’t feel safe with a woman at my side; they do naught but
bring bad luck. A lady shouldn’t—”
Whatever he was going to say was lost, for at that instant, Birgit did a very unladylike thing. Stepping
forward, she kicked Uthar between his legs and then grabbed the second man and pressed her knife
against his throat. She held him for a moment, so everyone could see what she had done, then released
her captive. Uthar rolled on the boards by her feet, holding himself and muttering a stream of curses.
“Does anyone else have an objection?” demanded Birgit. Beside her, Nolfavrell stared with
openmouthed amazement at his mother.
Roran pulled his hood lower to conceal his grin. Good thing they haven’t noticed Gertrude, he
thought.
When no one else challenged Birgit, Jeod asked, “Did you bring what I wanted?” Each sailor reached
inside his vest and divulged a weighted club and several lengths of rope.
Thus armed, they worked their way down the harbor toward the Dragon Wing, doing their best to
escape detection. Jeod kept his lantern shuttered the whole while. Near the dock, they hid behind a

Page 620

warehouse and watched the two lights carried by sentries bob around the deck of the ship. The gangway
had been pulled away for the night.
“Remember,” whispered Jeod, “the most important thing is to keep the alarm from being sounded until
we’re ready to leave.”
“Two men above, two men below, right?” asked Roran.
Uthar replied, “That be the custom.”
Roran and Uthar stripped to their breeches, tied the rope and clubs around their waists—Roran left his
hammer behind—and then ran far-ther down the wharf, out of the sentries’ sight, where they lowered
themselves into the frigid water.
“Garr, I hate when I have to do this,” said Uthar.
“You’ve done it before?”
“Four times now. Don’t stop moving or you’ll freeze.”
Clinging to the slimy piles underneath the wharf, they swam back up the way they had come until they
reached the stone pier that led to the Dragon Wing, and then turned right. Uthar put his lips to Roran’s
ear. “I’ll take the starboard anchor.” Roran nodded his agreement.
They both dove under the black water, and there they separated. Uthar swam like a frog under the bow
of the ship, while Roran went straight to the port anchor and clung to its thick chain. He untied the club
from his waist and fit it between his teeth—as much to stop them from chattering as to free his
hands—and prepared to wait. The rough metal sapped the warmth from his arms as fast as ice.
Not three minutes later, Roran heard the scuff of Birgit’s boots above him as she walked to the end of
the pier, opposite the middle of the Dragon Wing, and then the faint sound of her voice as she engaged
the sentries in conversation. Hopefully, she would keep their attention away from the bow.
Now!
Roran pulled himself hand over hand along the chain. His right shoul-der burned where the Ra’zac had
bit him, but he pressed on. From the porthole where the anchor chain entered the ship, he clambered up
the ridges that supported the painted figurehead, over the railing, and onto the deck. Uthar was already
there, dripping and panting.
Clubs in hand, they padded toward the aft of the ship, using whatever cover they could find. They
stopped not ten feet behind the sentries. The two men leaned on the railing, bandying words with Birgit.
In a flash, Roran and Uthar burst into the open and struck the sentries on the head before they could
draw their sabers. Below, Birgit waved for Jeod and the rest of their group, and between them they
raised the gang-way and slid one end across to the ship, where Uthar lashed it to the rail-ing.
As Nolfavrell ran aboard, Roran tossed his rope to the boy and said, “Tie and gag these two.”
Then everyone but Gertrude descended belowdecks to hunt for the remaining sentries. They found four
additional men—the purser, the bo-sun, the ship’s cook, and the ship’s cook’s assistant—all of whom

Page 621

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

were trundled out of bed, knocked on the head if they resisted, and then se-curely trussed. In this, Birgit
again proved her worth, capturing two men herself.
Jeod had the unhappy prisoners placed in a line on the deck so they could be watched at all times, then
declared, “We have much to do, and little time. Roran, Uthar is captain on the Dragon Wing. You and
the others will take your orders from him.”
For the next two hours, the ship was a frenzy of activity. The sailors tended to the rigging and sails, while
Roran and those from Carvahall worked to empty the hold of extraneous supplies, such as bales of raw
wool. These they lowered overboard to prevent anyone on the wharf from hearing a splash. If the entire
village was to fit on the Dragon Wing, they needed to clear as much space as possible.
Roran was in the midst of fitting a cable around a barrel when he heard the hoarse cry, “Someone’s
coming!” Everyone on deck, except Jeod and Uthar, dropped to their bellies and reached for their
weapons. The two men who remained standing paced the ship as if they were sentries. Ro-ran’s heart
pounded while he lay motionless, wondering what was about to happen. He held his breath as Jeod
addressed the intruder... then foot-steps echoed on the gangway.
It was Helen.
She wore a plain dress, her hair was bound under a kerchief, and she carried a burlap sack over one
shoulder. She spoke not a word, but stowed her gear in the main cabin and returned to stand by Jeod.
Roran thought he had never seen a happier man.
The sky above the distant mountains of the Spine had just begun to brighten when one of the sailors in
the rigging pointed north and whis-tled to indicate he had spotted the villagers.
Roran moved even faster. What time they had was now gone. He rushed up on deck and peered at the
dark line of people advancing down the coast. This part of their plan depended on the fact that, unlike
other coastal cities, Teirm’s outer wall had not been left open to the sea, but rather completely enclosed
the bulk of the city in order to ward off fre-quent pirate attacks. This meant that the buildings skirting the
harbor were left exposed—and that the villagers could walk right up to the Dragon Wing.
“Hurry now, hurry!” said Jeod.
At Uthar’s command, the sailors brought out armfuls of javelins for the great bows on deck, as well as
casks of foul-smelling tar, which they knocked open and used to paint the upper half of the javelins. They
then drew and loaded the ballistae on the starboard side; it took two men per bow to pull out the sinew
cord until it caught on its hook.
The villagers were two-thirds of the way to the ship before the soldiers patrolling the battlements of
Teirm spotted them and trumpeted the alarm. Even before that first note faded, Uthar bellowed, “Light
and fire ’em!”
Dashing open Jeod’s lantern, Nolfavrell ran from one ballista to the next, holding the flame to the javelins
until the tar ignited. The instant a missile caught, the man behind the bow pulled the release line and the
javelin vanished with a heavy thunk. In all, twelve blazing bolts shot from the Dragon Wing and pierced
the ships and buildings along the bay like roaring, red-hot meteors from the heavens above.
“Draw and reload!” shouted Uthar.

Page 622

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

The creak of bending wood filled the air as every man hauled back on the twisted cords. Javelins were
slotted in place. Once again, Nolfavrell made his run. Roran could feel the vibration in his feet as the
ballista in front of him sent its deadly projectile winging on its way.
The fire quickly spread along the waterfront, forming an impenetrable barrier that prevented soldiers
from reaching the Dragon Wing though Teirm’s east gate. Roran had counted on the pillar of smoke to
hide the ship from the archers on the battlements, but it was a near thing; a flight of arrows tugged at the
rigging, and one dart embedded itself in the deck by Gertrude before the soldiers lost sight of the ship.
From the bow, Uthar shouted, “Pick your targets at will!”
The villagers were running pell-mell down the beach now. They reached the north end of the wharf, and
a handful of them stumbled and fell as the soldiers in Teirm redirected their aim. Children screamed in
terror. Then the villagers regained momentum. They pounded down the planks, past a warehouse
engulfed in flame and along the pier. The pant-ing mob charged onto the ship in a confused mass of
jostling bodies.
Birgit and Gertrude guided the stream of people to the fore and aft hatches. In a few minutes, the various
levels of the ship were packed to their limit, from the cargo hold to the captain’s cabin. Those who could
not fit below remained huddled on deck, holding Fisk’s shields over their heads.
As Roran had asked in his message, all able-bodied men from Carvahall clustered around the mainmast,
waiting for instructions. Roran saw Mandel among them and tossed him a proud salute.
Then Uthar pointed at a sailor and barked, “You there, Bonden! Get those swabs to the capstans and
weigh anchors, then down to the oars. Double time!” To the rest of the men at the ballistae, he ordered,
“Half of you leave off and take the port ballistae. Drive away any boarding parties.”
Roran was one of those who switched sides. As he prepared the ballis-tae, a few laggards staggered out
of the acrid smoke and onto the ship. Beside him, Jeod and Helen hoisted the six prisoners one by one
onto the gangway and rolled them onto the pier.
Before Roran quite knew it, anchors had been raised, the gangway was cut loose, and a drum pounded
beneath his feet, setting the tempo for the oarsmen. Ever so slowly, the Dragon Wing turned to
starboard— toward the open sea—and then, with gathering speed, pulled away from the dock.
Roran accompanied Jeod to the quarterdeck, where they watched the crimson inferno devour everything
flammable between Teirm and the ocean. Through the filter of smoke, the sun appeared a flat, bloated,
bloody orange disk as it rose over the city.
How many have I killed now?wondered Roran.
Echoing his thoughts, Jeod observed, “This will harm a great many in-nocent people.”
Guilt made Roran respond with more force than he intended: “Would you rather be in Lord Risthart’s
prisons? I doubt many will be injured in the blaze, and those that aren’t won’t face death, like we will if
the Em-pire catches us.”
“You needn’t lecture me, Roran. I know the arguments well enough. We did what we had to. Just don’t
ask me to take pleasure in the suffer-ing we’ve caused to ensure our own safety.”

Page 623

By noon the oars had been stowed and the Dragon Wing sailed under her own power, propelled by
favorable winds from the north. The gusts of air caused the rigging overhead to emit a low hum.
The ship was miserably overcrowded, but Roran was confident that with some careful planning they
could make it to Surda with a minimum of discomfort. The worst inconvenience was that of limited
rations; if they were to avoid starvation, food would have to be dispensed in mis-erly portions. And in
such cramped quarters, disease was an all too likely possibility.
After Uthar gave a brief speech about the importance of discipline on a ship, the villagers applied
themselves to the tasks that required their im-mediate attention, such as tending to their wounded,
unpacking their meager belongings, and deciding upon the most efficient sleeping ar-rangement for each
deck. They also had to choose people to fill the vari-ous positions on the Dragon Wing : who would
cook, who would train as sailors under Uthar’s men, and so forth.
Roran was helping Elain hang a hammock when he became embroiled in a heated dispute between
Odele, her family, and Frewin, who had ap-parently deserted Torson’s crew to stay with Odele. The
two of them wanted to marry, which Odele’s parents vehemently opposed on the grounds that the young
sailor lacked a family of his own, a respectable profession, and the means to provide even a modicum of
comfort for their daughter. Roran thought it best if the enamored couple remained together—it seemed
impractical to try and separate them while they re-mained confined to the same ship—but Odele’s
parents refused to give his arguments credence.
Frustrated, Roran said, “What would you do, then? You can’t lock her away, and I believe Frewin has
proved his devotion more than—”
“Ra’zac!”
The cry came from the crow’s nest.
Without a second thought, Roran yanked his hammer from his belt, whirled about, and scrambled up the
ladder through the fore hatchway, barking his shin on the way. He sprinted toward the knot of people on
the quarterdeck, coming to a halt beside Horst.
The smith pointed.
One of the Ra’zac’s dread steeds drifted like a tattered shadow above the edge of the coastline, a
Ra’zac on its back. Seeing the two monsters exposed in daylight in no way diminished the creeping
horror they in-spired in Roran. He shuddered as the winged creature uttered its terrify-ing shriek, and
then the Ra’zac’s insectile voice drifted across the water, faint but distinct: “You shall not essscape!”
Roran looked at the ballistae, but they could not turn far enough to aim at the Ra’zac or its mount. “Does
anyone have a bow?”
“I do,” said Baldor. He dropped to one knee and began to string his weapon. “Don’t let them see me.”
Everyone on the quarterdeck gathered in a tight circle around Baldor, shielding him with their bodies from
the Ra’zac’s malevolent gaze.
“Why don’t they attack?” growled Horst.
Puzzled, Roran searched for an explanation but found none. It was Jeod who suggested, “Perhaps it’s
too bright for them. The Ra’zac hunt at night, and so far as I know they do not willingly venture forth

Page 624

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

from their lairs while the sun is yet in the sky.”
“It’s not just that,” said Gertrude slowly. “I think they’re afraid of the ocean.”
“Afraid of the ocean?” scoffed Horst.
“Watch them; they don’t fly more than a yard over the water at any given time.”
“She’s right,” said Roran. At last, a weakness I can use against them!
A few seconds later, Baldor said, “Ready!”
At his word, the ranks of people who stood before him jumped aside, clearing the path for his arrow.
Baldor sprang to his feet and, in a single motion, pulled the feather to his cheek and loosed the reed shaft.
It was a heroic shot. The Ra’zac was at the extreme edge of a longbow’s range—far beyond any mark
Roran had seen an archer hit—and yet Bal-dor’s aim was true. His arrow struck the flying creature on
the right flank, and the beast gave a scream of pain so great that the glass on the deck was shattered and
the stones on the shore were riven in shards. Roran clapped his hands over his ears to protect them from
the hideous blast. Still screaming, the monster veered inland and dropped behind a line of misty hills.
“Did you kill it?” asked Jeod, his face pale.
“I fear not,” replied Baldor. “It was naught but a flesh wound.”
Loring, who had just arrived, observed with satisfaction, “Aye. But at least you hurt him, and I’d wager
they’ll think twice about bothering us again.”
Gloom settled over Roran. “Save your triumph for later, Loring. This was no victory.”
“Why not?” demanded Horst.
“Because now the Empire knows exactly where we are.” The quarter-deck fell silent as they grasped the
implications of what he had said.
CHILD’S PLAY

“And this,” said Trianna, “is the latest pattern we’ve invented.”
Nasuada took the black veil from the sorceress and ran it through her hands, marveling at its quality. No
human could throw lace that fine. She gazed with satisfaction at the rows of boxes on her desk, which
contained samples of the many designs Du Vrangr Gata now produced. “You’ve done well,” she said.
“Far better than I had hoped. Tell your spellcasters how pleased I am with their work. It means much to
the Varden.”
Trianna inclined her head at the praise. “I will convey your message to them, Lady Nasuada.”
“Have they yet—”

Page 625

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

A disturbance at the doors to her quarters interrupted Nasuada. She heard her guards swear and raise
their voices, then a yelp of pain. The sound of metal clashing on metal rang in the hallway. Nasuada
backed away from the door in alarm, drawing her dagger from its sheath.
“Run, Lady!” said Trianna. The sorceress placed herself in front of Nasuada and pushed back her
sleeves, baring her white arms in prepara-tion to work magic. “Take the servants’ entrance.”
Before Nasuada could move, the doors burst open and a small figure tackled her legs, knocking her to
the floor. Even as Nasuada fell, a silvery object flashed through the space she had just occupied, burying
itself in the far wall with a dull thud.
Then the four guards entered, and all was confusion as Nasuada felt them drag her assailant off her.
When Nasuada managed to stand, she saw Elva hanging in their grip.
“What is the meaning of this?” demanded Nasuada.
The black-haired girl smiled, then doubled over and retched on the braided rug. Afterward, she fixed her
violet eyes on Nasuada and—in her terrible, knowing voice—she said, “Have your magician examine the
wall, O Daughter of Ajihad, and see if I have not fulfilled my promise to you.”
Nasuada nodded to Trianna, who glided to the splintered hole in the wall and muttered a spell. She
returned holding a metal dart. “This was buried in the wood.”
“But where did it come from?” asked Nasuada, bewildered.
Trianna gestured toward the open window overlooking the city of Aberon. “Somewhere out there, I
guess.”
Nasuada returned her attention to the waiting child. “What do you know about this, Elva?”
The girl’s horrible smile widened. “It was an assassin.”
“Who sent him?”
“An assassin trained by Galbatorix himself in the dark uses of magic.” Her burning eyes grew half-lidded,
as if she were in a trance. “The man hates you. He’s coming for you. He would have killed you if I hadn’t
stopped him.” She lurched forward and retched again, spewing half-digested food across the floor.
Nasuada gagged with revulsion. “And he’s about to suffer great pain.”
“Why is that?”
“Because I will tell you he stays in the hostel on Fane Street, in the last room, on the top floor. You had
better hurry, or he’ll get away... away.” She groaned like a wounded beast and clutched her belly.
“Hurry, before Eragon’s spell forces me to stop you from hurting him. You’ll be sorry, then!”
Trianna was already moving as Nasuada said, “Tell Jörmundur what’s happened, then take your
strongest magicians and hunt down this man. Capture him if you can. Kill him if you can’t.” After the
sorceress left, Nasuada looked at her men and saw that their legs were bleeding from numerous small
cuts. She realized what it must have cost Elva to hurt them. “Go,” she told them. “Find a healer who can
mend your injuries.”

Page 626

The warriors shook their heads, and their captain said, “No, Ma’am. We will stay by your side until we
know it’s safe again.”
“As you see fit, Captain.”
The men barricaded the windows—which worsened the already swel-tering heat that plagued Borromeo
Castle—then everyone retreated to her inner chambers for further protection.
Nasuada paced, her heart pounding with delayed shock as she contem-plated how close she had come
to being killed. What would become of the Varden if I died? she wondered. Who would succeed me?
Dismay gripped her; she had made no arrangements for the Varden in the event of her own demise, an
oversight that now seemed a monumental failing. I won’t allow the Varden to be thrown into chaos
because I failed to take precau-tions!
She halted. “I am in your debt, Elva.”
“Now and forever.”
Nasuada faltered, disconcerted as she often was by the girl’s responses, then continued: “I apologize for
not ordering my guards to let you pass, night or day. I should have anticipated an event like this.”
“You should have,” agreed Elva in a mocking tone.
Smoothing the front of her dress, Nasuada resumed pacing, as much to escape the sight of Elva’s
stone-white, dragon-marked face as to disperse her own nervous energy. “How did you escape your
rooms unaccompa-nied?”
“I told my caretaker, Greta, what she wanted to hear.”
“That’s all?”
Elva blinked. “It made her very happy.”
“And what of Angela?”
“She left on an errand this morning.”
“Well, be as that may, you have my gratitude for saving my life. Ask me any boon you want and I shall
grant it if it’s within my power.”
Elva glanced around the ornate bedroom, then said, “Do you have any food? I’m hungry.”
PREMONITION OF WAR

Two hours later, Trianna returned, leading a pair of warriors who car-ried a limp body between them.
At Trianna’s word, the men dropped the corpse on the floor. Then the sorceress said, “We found the
assassin where Elva said we would. Drail was his name.”
Motivated by a morbid curiosity, Nasuada examined the face of the man who had tried to kill her. The

Page 627

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

assassin was short, bearded, and plain-looking, no different from countless other men in the city. She felt
a cer-tain connection to him, as if his attempt on her life and the fact that she had arranged his death in
return linked them in the most intimate man-ner possible. “How was he killed?” she asked. “I see no
marks on his body.”
“He committed suicide with magic when we overwhelmed his defenses and entered his mind, but before
we could take control of his actions.”
“Were you able to learn anything of use before he died?”
“We were. Drail was part of a network of agents based here in Surda who are loyal to Galbatorix. They
are called the Black Hand. They spy on us, sabotage our war efforts, and—best we could determine in
our brief glimpse into Drail’s memories—are responsible for dozens of murders throughout the Varden.
Apparently, they’ve been waiting for a good chance to kill you ever since we arrived from Farthen Dûr.”
“Why hasn’t this Black Hand assassinated King Orrin yet?”
Trianna shrugged. “I can’t say. It may be that Galbatorix considers you to be more of a threat than
Orrin. If that’s the case, then once the Black Hand realizes you are protected from their attacks”— here
her gaze darted toward Elva—“Orrin won’t live another month unless he is guarded by magicians day
and night. Or perhaps Galbatorix has abstained from such direct action because he wanted the Black
Hand to remain unnoticed. Surda has always existed at his tolerance. Now that it’s be-come a threat...”
“Can you protect Orrin as well?” asked Nasuada, turning to Elva.
Her violet eyes seemed to glow. “Maybe if he asks nicely.”
Nasuada’s thoughts raced as she considered how to thwart this new menace. “Can all of Galbatorix’s
agents use magic?”
“Drail’s mind was confused, so it’s hard to tell,” said Trianna, “but I’d guess a fair number of them can.”
Magic,cursed Nasuada to herself. The greatest danger the Varden faced from magicians—or any person
trained in the use of their mind—was not assassination, but rather espionage. Magicians could spy on
people’s thoughts and glean information that could be used to destroy the Varden. That was precisely
why Nasuada and the entire command structure of the Varden had been taught to know when someone
was touching their minds and how to shield themselves from such attentions. Nasuada sus-pected that
Orrin and Hrothgar relied upon similar precautions within their own governments.
However, since it was impractical for everyone privy to potentially damaging information to master that
skill, one of Du Vrangr Gata’s many responsibilities was to hunt for anyone who was siphoning off facts
as they appeared in people’s minds. The cost of such vigilance was that Du Vrangr Gata ended up spying
on the Varden as much as on their ene-mies, a fact that Nasuada made sure to conceal from the bulk of
her fol-lowers, for it would only sow hatred, distrust, and dissent. She disliked the practice but saw no
alternative.
What she had learned about the Black Hand hardened Nasuada’s con-viction that, somehow, magicians
had to be governed.
“Why,” she asked, “didn’t you discover this sooner? I can understand that you might miss a lone
assassin, but an entire network of spellcasters dedicated to our destruction? Explain yourself, Trianna.”

Page 628

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

The sorceress’s eyes flashed with anger at the accusation. “Because here, unlike in Farthen Dûr, we
cannot examine everyone’s minds for duplic-ity. There are just too many people for us magicians to keep
track of. That is why we didn’t know about the Black Hand until now, Lady Nasuada.”
Nasuada paused, then inclined her head. “Understood. Did you discover the identities of any other
members of the Black Hand?”
“A few.”
“Good. Use them to ferret out the rest of the agents. I want you to de-stroy this organization for me,
Trianna. Eradicate them as you would an infestation of vermin. I’ll give you however many men you
need.”
The sorceress bowed. “As you wish, Lady Nasuada.”
At a knock on the door, the guards drew their swords and positioned themselves on either side of the
entranceway, then their captain yanked open the door without warning. A young page stood outside, a
fist raised to knock again. He stared with astonishment at the body on the floor, then snapped to attention
as the captain asked, “What is it, boy?”
“I have a message for Lady Nasuada from King Orrin.”
“Then speak and be quick about it,” said Nasuada.
The page took a moment to compose himself. “King Orrin requests that you attend him directly in his
council chambers, for he has received reports from the Empire that demand your immediate attention.”
“Is that all?”
“Yes, Ma’am.”
“I must attend to this. Trianna, you have your orders. Captain, will you leave one of your men to dispose
of Drail?”
“Aye, Ma’am.”
“Also, please have him locate Farica, my handmaid. She will see to it that my study is cleaned.”
“And what of me?” asked Elva, tilting her head.
“You,” said Nasuada, “shall accompany me. That is, if you feel strong enough to do so.”
The girl threw back her head, and from her small, round mouth ema-nated a cold laugh. “I’m strong
enough, Nasuada. Are you?”
Ignoring the question, Nasuada swept forth into the hallway with her guards clustered around her. The
stones of the castle exuded an earthy smell in the heat. Behind her, she heard the patter of Elva’s
footsteps and was perversely pleased that the ghastly child had to hurry to keep pace with the adults’
longer stride.

Page 629

The guards remained behind in the vestibule to the council chambers while Nasuada and Elva proceeded
inside. The chambers were bare to the point of severity, reflecting the militant nature of Surda’s existence.
The country’s kings had devoted their resources to protecting their peo-ple and overthrowing Galbatorix,
not to decorating Borromeo Castle with idle riches as the dwarves had done with Tronjheim.
In the main room lay a rough-hewn table twelve feet long, upon which a map of Alagaësia was staked
open with daggers at the four corners. As was custom, Orrin sat at the head of the table, while his
various advis-ers—many of whom, Nasuada knew, vehemently opposed her— occupied the chairs
farther down. The Council of Elders was also present. Nasuada noticed the concern on Jörmundur’s face
as he looked at her and deduced that Trianna had indeed told him about Drail.
“Sire, you asked for me?”
Orrin rose. “That I did. We have now—” He stopped in midword as he noticed Elva. “Ah, yes, Shining
Brow. I have not had the opportunity to grant you audience before, though accounts of your feats have
reached my ear and, I must confess, I have been most curious to meet you. Have you found the quarters
I arranged for you satisfactory?”
“They are quite nice, Sire. Thank you.” At the sound of her eerie voice, the voice of an adult, everyone
at the table flinched.
Irwin, the prime minister, bolted upright and pointed a quivering finger at Elva. “Why have you brought
this... this abomination here?”
“You forget your manners, sir,” replied Nasuada, though she understood his sentiment.
Orrin frowned. “Yes, do restrain yourself, Irwin. However, his point is valid, Nasuada; we cannot have
this child present at our deliberations.”
“The Empire,” she said, “has just tried to assassinate me.” The room echoed with cries of surprise. “If it
were not for Elva’s swift action, I would be dead. As a result, I have taken her into my confidence;
where I go, she goes.” Let them wonder what it is exactly Elva can do.
“This is indeed distressing news!” exclaimed the king. “Have you caught the blackguard responsible?”
Seeing the eager expressions of his advisers, Nasuada hesitated. “It would be best to wait until I can
give you an account in private, Sire.”
Orrin appeared put out by her response, but he did not pursue the is-sue. “Very well. But sit, sit! We
have just received the most troubling re-port.” After Nasuada took her place opposite him—Elva lurking
behind her—he continued: “It seems that our spies in Gil’ead have been deceived as to the status of
Galbatorix’s army.”
“How so?”
“They believe the army to be in Gil’ead, whereas we have here a mis-sive from one of our men in
Urû’baen, who says that he witnessed a great host march south past the capital a week and a half ago. It
was night, so he could not be sure of their numbers, but he was certain that the host was far larger than
the sixteen thousand that form the core of Galba-torix’s troops. There may have been as many as a
hundred thousand sol-diers, or more.”

A hundred thousand!A cold pit of fear settled in Nasuada’s stomach. “Can we trust your source?”
“His intelligence has always been reliable.”
“I don’t understand,” said Nasuada. “How could Galbatorix move that many men without our knowing
of it before? The supply trains alone would be miles long. It’s been obvious the army was mobilizing, but
the Empire was nowhere near ready to deploy.”
Falberd spoke then, slapping a heavy hand on the table for emphasis: “We were outfoxed. Our spies
must have been deceived with magic to think the army was still in their barracks in Gil’ead.”
Nasuada felt the blood drain from her face. “The only person strong enough to sustain an illusion of that
size and duration—”
“Is Galbatorix himself,” completed Orrin. “That was our conclusion. It means that Galbatorix has finally
abandoned his lair in favor of open combat. Even as we speak, the black foe approaches.”
Irwin leaned forward. “The question now is how we should respond. We must confront this threat, of
course, but in what manner? Where, when, and how? Our own forces aren’t prepared for a campaign of
this magnitude, while yours, Lady Nasuada—the Varden—are already accus-tomed to the fierce clamor
of war.”
“What do you mean to imply?” That we should die for you?
“I but made an observation. Take it how you will.”
Then Orrin said, “Alone, we will be crushed against an army so large. We must have allies, and above all
else we must have Eragon, especially if we are to confront Galbatorix. Nasuada, will you send for him?”
“I would if I could, but until Arya returns, I have no way to contact the elves or to summon Eragon.”
“In that case,” said Orrin in a heavy voice, “we must hope that she ar-rives before it is too late. I do not
suppose we can expect the elves’ assis-tance in this affair. While a dragon may traverse the leagues
between Aberon and Ellesméra with the speed of a falcon, it would be impossible for the elves to
marshal themselves and cross that same distance before the Empire reaches us. That leaves only the
dwarves. I know that you have been friends with Hrothgar for many years; will you send him a plea for
help on our behalf? The dwarves have always promised they would fight when the time came.”
Nasuada nodded. “Du Vrangr Gata has an arrangement with certain dwarf magicians that allows us to
transfer messages instantaneously. I will convey your— our—request. And I will ask Hrothgar to send
an emissary to Ceris to inform the elves of the situation so that they are forewarned, if nothing else.”
“Good. We are quite a ways from Farthen Dûr, but if we can delay the Empire for even a week, the
dwarves might be able to get here in time.”
The discussion that followed was an exceedingly grim one. Various tac-tics existed for defeating a
larger—although not necessarily superior— force, but no one at the table could imagine how they might
defeat Gal-batorix, especially when Eragon was still so powerless compared to the ancient king. The only
ploy that might succeed would be to surround Er-agon with as many magicians, dwarf and human, as
possible, and then at-tempt to force Galbatorix to confront them alone. The problem with that plan,
thought Nasuada, is that Galbatorix overcame far more formidable enemies during his destruction

Page 631

of the Riders, and his strength has only grown since. She was certain that this had occurred to
everyone else as well. If we but had the elves’ spellweavers to swell our ranks, then victory might
be within our reach. Without them... If we cannot overthrow Galba-torix, the only avenue left
may be to flee Alagaësia across the sundering sea
and find a new land in which to build a life for ourselves. There we could wait until Galbatorix is no
more. Even he cannot endure forever. The only certainty is that, eventually, all things shall pass.
They moved on then from tactics to logistics, and here the debate be-came far more acrimonious as the
Council of Elders argued with Orrin’s advisers over the distribution of responsibilities between the
Varden and Surda: who should pay for this or that, provide rations for laborers who worked for both
groups, manage the provisions for their respective war-riors, and how numerous other related subjects
should be dealt with.
In the midst of the verbal fray, Orrin pulled a scroll from his belt and said to Nasuada, “On the matter of
finances, would you be so kind as to explain a rather curious item that was brought to my attention?”
“I’ll do my best, Sire.”
“I hold in my hand a complaint from the weavers’ guild, which asserts that weavers throughout Surda
have lost a good share of their profits be-cause the textile market has been inundated with extraordinarily
cheap lace—lace they swear originates with the Varden.” A pained look crossed his face. “It seems
foolish to even ask, but does their claim have basis in fact, and if so, why would the Varden do such a
thing?”
Nasuada made no attempt to hide her smile. “If you remember, Sire, when you refused to lend the
Varden more gold, you advised me to find another way for us to support ourselves.”
“So I did. What of it?” asked Orrin, narrowing his eyes.
“Well, it struck me that while lace takes a long time to make by hand, which is why it’s so expensive,
lace is quite easy to produce using magic due to the small amount of energy involved. You of all people,
as a natu-ral philosopher, should appreciate that. By selling our lace here and in the Empire, we have
been able to fully fund our efforts. The Varden no longer want for food or shelter.”
Few things in her life pleased Nasuada so much as Orrin’s incredulous expression at that instant. The
scroll frozen halfway between his chin and the table, his slightly parted mouth, and the quizzical frown
upon his brow conspired to give him the stunned appearance of a man who had just seen something he
did not understand. She savored the sight.
“Lace?”he sputtered.
“Yes, Sire.”
“You can’t fight Galbatorix with lace !”
“Why not, Sire?”
He struggled for a moment, then growled, “Because... because it’s not respectable, that’s why. What
bard would compose an epic about our deeds and write about lace ?”

Page 632

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“We do not fight in order to have epics written in our praise.”
“Then blast epics! How am I supposed to answer the weavers’ guild? By selling your lace so cheaply,
you hurt people’s livelihoods and undermine our economy. It won’t do. It won’t do at all.”
Letting her smile become sweet and warm, Nasuada said in her friend-liest tone, “Oh dear. If it’s too
much of a burden for your treasury, the Varden would be more than willing to offer you a loan in return
for the kindness you’ve shown us... at a suitable rate of interest, of course.”
The Council of Elders managed to maintain their decorum, but behind Nasuada, Elva uttered a quick
laugh of amusement.
RED BLADE, WHITE BLADE

The moment the sun appeared over the tree-lined horizon, Eragon deepened his breathing, willed his
heart to quicken, and opened his eyes as he returned to full awareness. He had not been asleep, for he
had not slept since his transformation. When he felt weary and lay himself down to rest, he entered a
state that was unto a waking dream. There he beheld many wondrous visions and walked among the gray
shades of his memo-ries, yet all the while remained aware of his surroundings.
He watched the sunrise and thoughts of Arya filled his mind, as they had every hour since the Agaetí
Blödhren two days before. The morning after the celebration, he had gone looking for her in Tialdarí
Hall— intending to try and make amends for his behavior—only to discover that she had already left for
Surda. When will I see her again? he wondered. In the clear light of day, he had realized just how much
the elves’ and drag-ons’ magic had dulled his wits during the Agaetí Blödhren. I may have acted a fool,
but it wasn’t entirely my fault. I was no more responsible for my conduct than if I were drunk .
Still, he had meant every word he said to Arya—even if normally he would not have revealed so much
of himself. Her rejection cut Eragon to the quick. Freed of the enchantments that had clouded his mind,
he was forced to admit that she was probably right, that the difference between their ages was too great
to overcome. It was a difficult thing for him to accept, and once he had, the knowledge only increased his
anguish.
Eragon had heard the expression “heartbroken” before. Until then, he always considered it a fanciful
description, not an actual physical symp-tom. But now he felt a deep ache in his chest—like that of a
sore mus-cle—and each beat of his heart pained him.
His only comfort was Saphira. In those two days, she had never criti-cized what he had done, nor did
she leave his side for more than a few minutes at a time, lending him the support of her companionship.
She talked to him a great deal as well, doing her best to draw him out of his shell of silence.
To keep himself from brooding over Arya, Eragon took Orik’s puzzle ring from his nightstand and rolled
it between his fingers, marveling at how keen his senses had become. He could feel every flaw in the
twisted metal. As he studied the ring, he perceived a pattern in the arrangement of the gold bands, a
pattern that had escaped him before. Trusting his instinct, he manipulated the bands in the sequence
suggested by his obser-vation. To his delight, the eight pieces fit together perfectly, forming a solid whole.
He slid the ring onto the fourth finger of his right hand, ad-miring how the woven bands caught the light.
You could not do that before,observed Saphira from the bowl in the floor where she slept.

I can see many things that were once hidden to me.
Eragon went to the wash closet and performed his morning ablutions, including removing the stubble
from his cheeks with a spell. Despite the fact that he now closely resembled an elf, he had retained the
ability to grow a beard.
Orik was waiting for them when Eragon and Saphira arrived at the sparring field. His eyes brightened as
Eragon lifted his hand and displayed the completed puzzle ring. “You solved it, then!”
“It took me longer than I expected,” said Eragon, “but yes. Are you here to practice as well?”
“Eh. I already got in a bit o’ ax work with an elf who took a rather fiendish delight in cracking me over
the head. No... I came to watch you fight.”
“You’ve seen me fight before,” pointed out Eragon.
“Not for a while, I haven’t.”
“You mean you’re curious to see how I’ve changed.” Orik shrugged in response.
Vanir approached from across the field. He cried, “Are you ready, Shadeslayer?” The elf’s
condescending demeanor had lessened since their last duel before the Agaetí Blödhren, but not by much.
“I’m ready.”
Eragon and Vanir squared off against each other in an open area of the field. Emptying his mind, Eragon
grasped and drew Zar’roc as fast as he could. To his surprise, the sword felt as if it weighed no more
than a wil-low wand. Without the expected resistance, Eragon’s arm snapped straight, tearing the sword
from his hand and sending it whirling twenty yards to his right, where it buried itself in the trunk of a pine
tree.
“Can you not even hold on to your blade, Rider?” demanded Vanir.
“I apologize, Vanir-vodhr,” gasped Eragon. He clutched his elbow, rub-bing the bruised joint to lessen
the pain. “I misjudged my strength.”
“See that it does not happen again.” Going to the tree, Vanir gripped Zar’roc’s hilt and tried to pull the
sword free. The weapon remained mo-tionless. Vanir’s eyebrows met as he frowned at the unyielding
crimson blade, as if he suspected some form of trickery. Bracing himself, the elf heaved backward and,
with the crack of wood, yanked Zar’roc out of the pine.
Eragon accepted the sword from Vanir and hefted Zar’roc, troubled by how light it was. Something’s
wrong, he thought.
“Take your place!”
This time it was Vanir who initiated the fight. In a single bound, he crossed the distance between them
and thrust his blade toward Eragon’s right shoulder. To Eragon, it seemed as if the elf moved slower than
usual, as if Vanir’s reflexes had been reduced to the level of a human’s. It was easy for Eragon to deflect
Vanir’s sword, blue sparks flying from the metal as their blades grated against one another.

Page 634

Vanir landed with an astonished expression. He struck again, and Er-agon evaded the sword by leaning
back, like a tree swaying in the wind. In quick succession, Vanir rained a score of heavy blows upon
Eragon, each of which Eragon dodged or blocked, using Zar’roc’s sheath as often as the sword to foil
Vanir’s onslaught.
Eragon soon realized that the spectral dragon from the Agaetí Blödhren had done more than alter his
appearance; it had also granted him the elves’ physical abilities. In strength and speed, Eragon now
matched even the most athletic elf.
Fired by that knowledge and a desire to test his limits, Eragon jumped as high as he could. Zar’roc
flashed crimson in the sunlight as he flew skyward, soaring more than ten feet above the ground before he
flipped like an acrobat and came down behind Vanir, facing the direction from which he had started.
A fierce laugh erupted from Eragon. No more was he helpless before elves, Shades, and other creatures
of magic. No more would he suffer the elves’ contempt. No more would he have to rely on Saphira or
Arya to rescue him from enemies like Durza.
He charged Vanir, and the field rang with a furious din as they strove against each other, raging back and
forth upon the trampled grass. The force of their blows created gusts of wind that whipped their hair into
tangled disarray. Overhead, the trees shook and dropped their needles. The duel lasted long into the
morning, for even with Eragon’s newfound skill, Vanir was still a formidable opponent. But in the end,
Eragon would not be denied. Playing Zar’roc in a circle, he darted past Vanir’s guard and struck him
upon the upper arm, breaking the bone.
Vanir dropped his blade, his face turning white with shock. “How swift is your sword,” he said, and
Eragon recognized the famous line from The Lay of Umhodan.
“By the gods!” exclaimed Orik. “That was the best swordsmanship I’ve ever seen, and I was there
when you fought Arya in Farthen Dûr.”
Then Vanir did what Eragon had never expected: the elf twisted his uninjured hand in the gesture of
fealty, placed it upon his sternum, and bowed. “I beg your pardon for my earlier behavior, Eragon-elda. I
thought that you had consigned my race to the void, and out of my fear I acted most shamefully.
However, it seems that your race no longer endangers our cause.” In a grudging voice, he added: “You
are now worthy of the ti-tle Rider.”
Eragon bowed in return. “You honor me. I’m sorry that I injured you so badly. Will you allow me to
heal your arm?”
“No, I shall let nature tend to it at her own pace, as a memento that I once crossed blades with Eragon
Shadeslayer. You needn’t fear that it will disrupt our sparring tomorrow; I am equally good with my left
hand.”
They both bowed again, and then Vanir departed.
Orik slapped a hand on his thigh and said, “Now we have a chance at victory, a real chance! I can feel it
in my bones. Bones like stone, they say. Ah, this’ll please Hrothgar and Nasuada to no end.”
Eragon kept his peace and concentrated on removing the block from Zar’roc’s edges, but he said to
Saphira, If brawn were all that was required to depose Galbatorix, the elves would have done it

long ago. Still, he could not help being pleased by his heightened prowess, as well as by his
long-awaited reprieve from the torment of his back. Without the constant bursts of pain, it was as if a
haze had been lifted from his mind, allowing him to think clearly once again.
A few minutes remained before they were supposed to meet with Oromis and Glaedr, so Eragon took
his bow and quiver from where they hung on Saphira’s back and walked to the range where elves
practiced archery. Since the elves’ bows were much more powerful than his, their padded targets were
both too small and too far away for him. He had to shoot from halfway down the range.
Taking his place, Eragon nocked an arrow and slowly pulled back the string, delighted by how easy it
had become. He aimed, released the ar-row, and held his position, waiting to see if he would hit his
mark. Like a maddened hornet, the dart buzzed toward the target and buried itself in the center. He
grinned. Again and again, he fired at the target, his speed increasing with his confidence until he loosed
thirty arrows in a minute.
At the thirty-first arrow, he pulled on the string slightly harder than he had ever done—or was capable of
doing—before. With an explosive re-port, the yew bow broke in half underneath his left hand, scratching
his fingers and discharging a burst of splinters from the back of the bow. His hand went numb from the
jolt.
Eragon stared at the remains of his weapon, dismayed by the loss. Gar-row had made it as a birthday
present for him over three years ago. Since then, hardly a week went by when Eragon had not used his
bow. It had helped him to provide food for his family on numerous occasions when they would have
otherwise gone hungry. With it, he had killed his first deer. With it, he had killed his first Urgal. And
through it, he had first used magic. Losing his bow was like losing an old friend who could be relied upon
in even the worst situation.
Saphira sniffed the two pieces of wood dangling from his grip and said, It seems you need a new stick
thrower. He grunted—in no mood to talk— and stomped out to retrieve his arrows.
From the open field, he and Saphira flew to the white Crags of Tel’naeír and presented themselves to
Oromis, who was seated on a stool in front of his hut, gazing out over the cliff with his farseeing eyes. He
said, “Have you entirely recovered, Eragon, from the potent magic of the Blood-oath Celebration?”
“I have, Master.”
A long silence followed as Oromis drank from a cup of blackberry tea and resumed contemplating the
ancient forest. Eragon waited without complaint; he was used to such pauses when dealing with the old
Rider. At length, Oromis said, “Glaedr explained to me, as best he could, what was done to you during
the celebration. Such a thing has never before oc-curred in the history of the Riders.... Once again, the
dragons have proved themselves capable of far more than we imagined.” He sipped his tea. “Glaedr was
uncertain exactly what changes you would experience, so I would like you to describe the full extent of
your transformation, includ-ing your appearance.”
Eragon quickly summarized how he had been altered, detailing the in-creased sensitivity of his sight,
smell, hearing, and touch, and ending with an account of his clash with Vanir.
“And how,” asked Oromis, “do you feel about this? Do you resent that your body was manipulated
without your permission?”
“No, no! Not at all. I might have resented it before the battle of Farthen Dûr, but now I’m just grateful

Page 636

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

that my back doesn’t hurt anymore. I would have willingly submitted myself to far greater changes in
order to escape Durza’s curse. No, my only response is gratitude.”
Oromis nodded. “I am glad that you are wise enough to take that posi-tion, for your gift is worth more
than all the gold in the world. With it, I believe that our feet are at last set upon the correct path.” Again,
he sipped his tea. “Let us proceed. Saphira, Glaedr expects you at the Stone of Broken Eggs. Eragon,
you will begin today with the third level of Rimgar, if you can. I would know everything you are capable
of.”
Eragon started toward the square of tamped earth where they usually performed the Dance of Snake
and Crane, then hesitated when the silver-haired elf remained behind. “Master, won’t you join me?”
A sad smile graced Oromis’s face. “Not today, Eragon. The spells re-quired by the Blood-oath
Celebration exacted a heavy toll from me. That and my... condition. It took the last of my strength to
come sit outside.”
“I am sorry, Master.” Does he resent that the dragons didn’t choose to heal him as well? wondered
Eragon. He immediately discounted the thought; Oromis would never be so petty.
“Do not be. It is no fault of yours that I am crippled.”
As Eragon struggled to complete the third level of the Rimgar, it be-came obvious that he still lacked the
elves’ balance and flexibility, two attributes that even the elves had to work to acquire. In a way, he
wel-comed those limitations, for if he was perfect, what was left for him to accomplish?
The following weeks were difficult for Eragon. On one hand, he made enormous progress with his
training, mastering subject after subject that had once confounded him. He still found Oromis’s lessons
challenging, but he no longer felt as if he were drowning in a sea of his own inade-quacy. It was easier for
Eragon to read and write, and his increased strength meant that he could now cast elven spells that
required so much energy, they would kill any normal human. His strength also made him aware of how
weak Oromis was compared to other elves.
And yet, despite those accomplishments, Eragon experienced a growing sense of discontent. No matter
how hard he tried to forget Arya, every day that passed increased his yearning, an agony made worse by
knowing that she did not want to see or talk with him. But more than that, it seemed to him as if an
ominous storm was gathering beyond the edge of the horizon, a storm that threatened to break at any
moment and sweep across the land, devastating everything in its path.
Saphira shared his unease. She said, The world is stretched thin, Eragon. Soon it will snap and
madness will burst forth. What you feel is what we dragons feel and what the elves feel—the
inexorable march of grim fate as the end of our age approaches. Weep for those who will die in
the chaos that shall consume Alagaësia. And hope that we may win a brighter future by the
strength of your sword and shield and my fangs and talons.
VISIONS NEAR AND FAR

The day came when Eragon went to the glade beyond Oromis’s hut, seated himself on the polished
white stump in the center of the mossy hollow, and—when he opened his mind to observe the creatures
around him—sensed not just the birds, beasts, and insects but also the plants of the forest.

Page 637

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

The plants possessed a different type of consciousness than animals: slow, deliberate, and decentralized,
but in their own way just as cogni-zant of their surroundings as Eragon himself was. The faint pulse of the
plants’ awareness bathed the galaxy of stars that wheeled behind his eyes—each bright spark
representing a life—in a soft, omnipresent glow. Even the most barren soil teemed with organisms; the
land itself was alive and sentient.
Intelligent life, he concluded, existed everywhere.
As Eragon immersed himself in the thoughts and feelings of the beings around him, he was able to attain
a state of inner peace so profound that, during that time, he ceased to exist as an individual. He allowed
himself to become a nonentity, a void, a receptacle for the voices of the world. Nothing escaped his
attention, for his attention was focused on nothing.
He was the forest and its inhabitants.
Is that what a god feels like?wondered Eragon when he returned to himself.
He left the glade, sought out Oromis in his hut, and knelt before the elf, saying, “Master, I have done as
you told me to. I listened until I heard no more.”
Oromis paused in his writing and, with a thoughtful expression, looked at Eragon. “Tell me.” For an hour
and a half, Eragon waxed eloquent about every aspect of the plants and animals that populated the glade,
until Oromis raised his hand and said, “I am convinced; you heard all there was to hear. But did you
understand it all?”
“No, Master.”
“That is as it should be. Comprehension will come with age.... Well done, Eragon-finiarel. Well done
indeed. If you were my student in Ilirea, before Galbatorix rose to power, you would have just graduated
from your apprenticeship and would be considered a full member of our order and accorded the same
rights and privileges as even the oldest Riders.” Oromis pushed himself up out of his chair and then
remained standing in place, swaying. “Lend me your shoulder, Eragon, and help me outside. My limbs
betray my will.”
Hurrying to his master’s side, Eragon supported the elf’s slight weight as Oromis hobbled to the brook
that rushed headlong toward the edge of the Crags of Tel’naeír. “Now that you have reached this stage in
your education, I can teach you one of the greatest secrets of magic, a secret that even Galbatorix may
not know. It is your best hope of matching his power.” The elf’s gaze sharpened. “What is the cost of
magic, Eragon?”
“Energy. A spell costs the same amount of energy as it would to com-plete the task through mundane
means.”
Oromis nodded. “And where does the energy come from?”
“The spellcaster’s body.”
“Does it have to?”
Eragon’s mind raced as he considered the awesome implications of Oromis’s question. “You mean it

Page 638

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

can come from other sources?”
“That is exactly what happens whenever Saphira assists you with a spell.”
“Yes, but she and I share a unique connection,” protested Eragon. “Our bond is the reason I can draw
upon her strength. To do that with some-one else, I would have to enter...” He trailed off as he realized
what Oromis was driving at.
“You would have to enter the consciousness of the being—or beings— who was going to provide the
energy,” said Oromis, completing Eragon’s thought. “Today you proved that you can do just that with
even the smallest form of life. Now...” He stopped and pressed a hand against his chest as he coughed,
then continued, “I want you to extract a sphere of water from the stream, using only the energy you can
glean from the for-est around you.”
“Yes, Master.”
As Eragon reached out to the nearby plants and animals, he felt Oromis’s mind brush against his own,
the elf watching and judging his progress. Frowning with concentration, Eragon endeavored to eke the
needed force from the environment and hold it within himself until he was ready to release the magic....
“Eragon! Do not take it from me! I am weak enough as is.”
Startled, Eragon realized that he had included Oromis in his search. “I’m sorry, Master,” he said,
chastised. He resumed the process, careful to avoid draining the elf’s vitality, and when he was ready,
commanded, “Up!”
Silent as the night, a sphere of water a foot wide rose from the brook until it floated at eye level across
from Eragon. And while Eragon experi-enced the usual strain that results from intense effort, the spell
itself caused him no fatigue.
The sphere was only in the air for a moment when a wave of death rolled through the smaller creatures
Eragon was in contact with. A line of ants keeled over motionless. A baby mouse gasped and entered the
void as it lost the strength to keep its heart beating. Countless plants withered and crumbled and became
inert as dust.
Eragon flinched, horrified by what he had caused. Given his new re-spect for the sanctity of life, he
found the crime appalling. What made it worse was that he was intimately linked with each being as it
ceased to exist; it was as if he himself were dying over and over. He severed the flow of magic—letting
the sphere of water splash across the ground—and then whirled on Oromis and growled, “You knew
that would happen!”
An expression of profound sorrow engulfed the ancient Rider. “It was necessary,” he replied.
“Necessary that so many had to die?”
“Necessary that you understand the terrible price of using this type of magic. Mere words cannot convey
the feeling of having those whose minds you share die. You had to experience it for yourself.”
“I won’t do that again,” vowed Eragon.
“Nor will you have to. If you are disciplined, you can choose to draw the power only from plants and

Page 639

animals that can withstand the loss. It’s impractical in battle, but you may do so in your lessons.” Oromis
gestured at him, and, still simmering, Eragon allowed the elf to lean on him as they returned to the hut.
“You see why this technique was not taught to younger riders. If it were to become known to a
spellweaver of evil dis-position, he or she could wreak vast amounts of destruction, especially since it
would be difficult to stop anyone with access to so much power.” Once they were back inside, the elf
sighed, lowered himself into his chair, and pressed the tips of his fingers together.
Eragon sat as well. “Since it’s possible to absorb energy from”— he waved his hand—“from life, is it
also possible to absorb it directly from light or fire or from any of the other forms of energy?”
“Ah, Eragon, if it were, we could destroy Galbatorix in an instant. We can exchange energy with other
living beings, we can use that energy to move our bodies or to fuel a spell, and we can even store that
energy in certain objects for later use, but we cannot assimilate the fundamental forces of nature. Reason
says that it can be done, but no one has managed to devise a spell that allows it.”
Nine days later, Eragon presented himself to Oromis and said, “Master, it struck me last night that
neither you nor the hundreds of elven scrolls I’ve read have mentioned your religion. What do elves
believe?”
A long sigh was Oromis’s first answer. Then: “We believe that the world behaves according to certain
inviolable rules and that, by persistent effort, we can discover those rules and use them to predict events
when circumstances repeat.”
Eragon blinked. That did not tell him what he wanted to know. “But who, or what, do you worship?”
“Nothing.”
“You worship the concept of nothing?”
“No, Eragon. We do not worship at all.”
The thought was so alien, it took Eragon several moments to grasp what Oromis meant. The villagers of
Carvahall lacked a single overriding doctrine, but they did share a collection of superstitions and rituals,
most of which concerned warding off bad luck. During the course of his training, it had dawned upon
Eragon that many of the phenomena that the villagers attributed to supernatural sources were in fact
natural processes, such as when he learned in his meditations that maggots hatched from fly eggs instead
of spontaneously arising from the dirt, as he had thought be-fore. Nor did it make sense for him to put
out an offering of food to keep sprites from turning the milk sour when he knew that sour milk was
ac-tually caused by a proliferation of tiny organisms in the liquid. Still, Er-agon remained convinced that
otherworldly forces influenced the world in mysterious ways, a belief that his exposure to the dwarves’
religion had bolstered. He said, “Where do you think the world came from, then, if it wasn’t created by
the gods?”
“Which gods, Eragon?”
“Your gods, the dwarf gods, our gods... someone must have created it.”
Oromis raised an eyebrow. “I would not necessarily agree with you. But be as that may, I cannot prove
that gods do not exist. Nor can I prove that the world and everything in it was not created by an entity or
enti-ties in the distant past. But I can tell you that in the millennia we elves have studied nature, we have
never witnessed an instance where the rules that govern the world have been broken. That is, we have

never seen a miracle. Many events have defied our ability to explain, but we are con-vinced that we
failed because we are still woefully ignorant about the universe and not because a deity altered the
workings of nature.”
“A god wouldn’t have to alter nature to accomplish his will,” asserted Eragon. “He could do it within the
system that already exists.... He could use magic to affect events.”
Oromis smiled. “Very true. But ask yourself this, Eragon: If gods exist, have they been good custodians
of Alagaësia? Death, sickness, poverty, tyranny, and countless other miseries stalk the land. If this is the
handi-work of divine beings, then they are to be rebelled against and over-thrown, not given obeisance,
obedience, and reverence.”
“The dwarves believe—”
“Exactly! The dwarves believe. When it comes to certain matters, they rely upon faith rather than
reason. They have even been known to ignore proven facts that contradict their dogma.”
“Like what?” demanded Eragon.
“Dwarf priests use coral as proof that stone is alive and can grow, which also corroborates their story
that Helzvog formed the race of dwarves out of granite. But we elves discovered that coral is actually an
exoskeleton secreted by minuscule animals that live inside the coral. Any magician can sense the animals
if he opens his mind. We explained this to the dwarves, but they refused to listen, saying that the life we
felt resides in every kind of stone, although their priests are the only ones who are sup-posed to be able
to detect the life in landlocked stones.”
For a long time, Eragon stared out the window, turning Oromis’s words over in his mind. “You don’t
believe in an afterlife, then.”
“From what Glaedr said, you already knew that.”
“And you don’t put stock in gods.”
“We give credence only to that which we can prove exists. Since we cannot find evidence that gods,
miracles, and other supernatural things are real, we do not trouble ourselves about them. If that were to
change, if Helzvog were to reveal himself to us, then we would accept the new information and revise our
position.”
“It seems a cold world without something... more.”
“On the contrary,” said Oromis, “it is a better world. A place where we are responsible for our own
actions, where we can be kind to one another because we want to and because it is the right thing to do
instead of be-ing frightened into behaving by the threat of divine punishment. I won’t tell you what to
believe, Eragon. It is far better to be taught to think critically and then be allowed to make your own
decisions than to have someone else’s notions thrust upon you. You asked after our religion, and I have
answered you true. Make of it what you will.”
Their discussion—coupled with his previous worries—left Eragon so disturbed that he had difficulty
concentrating on his studies in the fol-lowing days, even when Oromis began to show him how to sing to
plants, which Eragon had been eager to learn.

Page 641

Eragon recognized that his own experiences had already led him to adopt a more skeptical attitude; in
principle, he agreed with much of what Oromis had said. The problem he struggled with, though, was that
if the elves were right, it meant that nearly all the humans and dwarves were deluded, something Eragon
found difficult to accept. That many people can’t be mistaken, he insisted to himself.
When he asked Saphira about it, she said, It matters little to me, Eragon. Dragons have never
believed in higher powers. Why should we when deer and other prey consider us to be a higher
power?He laughed at that. Only do not ignore reality in order to comfort yourself, for once you do,
you make it easy for others to deceive you.
That night, Eragon’s uncertainties burst forth in his waking dreams, which raged like a wounded bear
through his mind, tearing disparate im-ages from his memories and mixing them into such a clamor, he felt
as if he were transported back into the confusion of the battle under Farthen Dûr. He saw Garrow lying
dead in Horst’s house, then Brom dead in the lonely sandstone cave, and then the face of Angela
the herbalist, who whis-pered, “Beware, Argetlam, betrayal is clear. And it will come from within
your family. Beware, Shadeslayer!”
Then the crimson sky was torn apart and Eragon again beheld the two armies from his premonition in the
Beor Mountains. The banks of warriors collided upon an orange and yellow field, accompanied by the
harsh screams of gore-crows and the whistle of black arrows. The earth itself seemed to burn: green
flames belched from scorched holes that dotted the ground, charring the mangled corpses left in the
armies’ wake. He heard the roar of a gigantic beast from above that rapidly app—
Eragon jolted upright in bed and scrabbled at the dwarf necklace, which burned at his throat. Using his
tunic to protect his hand, he pulled the silver hammer away from his skin and then sat and waited in the
dark, his heart thudding from the surprise. He felt his strength ebb as Gannel’s spell thwarted whoever
was trying to scry him and Saphira. Once again, he wondered if Galbatorix himself was behind the spell,
or if it was one of the king’s pet magicians.
Eragon frowned and released the hammer as the metal grew cold again. Something’s wrong. I know
that much, and I’ve known it for a while, as has Saphira. Too uneasy to resume the trancelike state
that had replaced sleep for him, he crept from their bedroom without waking Saphira and climbed the
spiral staircase to the study. There he unshuttered a white lantern and read one of Analísia’s epics until
sunrise in an attempt to calm himself.
Just as Eragon put away the scroll, Blagden flew through the open por-tal in the eastern wall and, with a
flutter of wings, landed on the corner of the carved writing desk. The white raven fixed his beady eyes on
Er-agon and croaked, “Wyrda!”
Eragon inclined his head. “And may the stars watch over you, Master Blagden.”
The raven hopped closer. He cocked his head to the side and uttered a barking cough, as if he were
clearing his throat, then recited in his hoarse voice:
By beak and bone,
Mine blackened stone
Sees rooks and crooks
And bloody brooks!

Page 642

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“What does that mean?” asked Eragon.
Blagden shrugged and repeated the verse. When Eragon still pressed him for an explanation, the bird
ruffled his feathers, appearing displeased, and cackled, “Son and father alike, both as blind as bats.”
“Wait!” exclaimed Eragon, jolting upright. “Do you know my father? Who is he?”
Blagden cackled again. This time he seemed to be laughing.
While two may share two,
And one of two is certainly one,
One might be two.
“A name, Blagden. Give me a name!” When the raven remained silent, Eragon reached out with his
mind, intending to wrench the information from the bird’s memories.
Blagden was too wily, however. He deflected Eragon’s probe with a flick of his thoughts. Shrieking
“Wyrda!” he darted forward, plucked a bright glass stopper from an inkwell, and sped away with his
trophy clutched in his beak. He dove out of sight before Eragon could cast a spell to bring him back.
Eragon’s stomach knotted as he tried to decipher Blagden’s two riddles. The last thing he had expected
was to hear his father mentioned in Ellesméra. Finally, he muttered, “That’s it.” I’ll find Blagden later
and wring the truth out of him. But right now... I would have to be a half-wit to ignore these
portents. He jumped to his feet and ran down the stairs, wak-ing Saphira with his mind and telling her
what had transpired during the night. Retrieving his shaving mirror from the wash closet, Eragon sat
be-tween Saphira’s two front paws so that she could look over his head and see what he saw.
Arya won’t appreciate it if we intrude on her privacy,warned Saphira.
I have to know if she’s safe.
Saphira accepted that without argument. How will you find her? You said that after her
imprisonment, she erected wards that—like your neck-lace—prevent anyone from scrying her.
If I can scry the people she’s with, I might be able to figure out how Arya is.Concentrating on an image
of Nasuada, Eragon passed his hand over the mirror and murmured the traditional phrase, “Dream
stare.”
The mirror shimmered and turned white, except for nine people clus-tered around an invisible table. Of
them, Eragon was familiar with Nasuada and the Council of Elders. But he could not identify a strange
girl hooded in black who lurked behind Nasuada. This puzzled him, for a magician could only scry things
that he had already seen, and Eragon was certain he had never laid eyes upon the girl before. He forgot
about her, though, as he noticed that the men, and even Nasuada, were armed for battle.
Let us hear their words,suggested Saphira.
The instant Eragon made the needed alteration to the spell, Nasuada’s voice emanated from the mirror:
“... and confusion will destroy us. Our warriors can afford but one commander during this conflict.

Page 643

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Decide who it is to be, Orrin, and quickly too.”
Eragon heard a disembodied sigh. “As you wish; the position is yours.”
“But, sir, she is untried!”
“Enough, Irwin,” ordered the king. “She has more experience in war than anyone in Surda. And the
Varden are the only force to have de-feated one of Galbatorix’s armies. If Nasuada were a Surdan
general— which would be peculiar indeed, I admit—you would not hesitate to nominate her for the post.
I shall be happy to deal with questions of au-thority if they arise afterward, for they will mean I’m still on
my feet and not lying in a grave. As it is, we are so outnumbered I fear we are doomed unless Hrothgar
can reach us before the end of the week. Now, where is that blasted scroll on the supply train?... Ah,
thank you, Arya. Three more days without—”
After that the discussion turned to a shortage of bowstrings, which Er-agon could glean nothing useful
from, so he ended the spell. The mirror cleared, and he found himself staring at his own face.
She lives,he murmured. His relief was overshadowed, though, by the larger meaning of what they had
heard.
Saphira looked at him. We are needed.
Aye. Why hasn’t Oromis told us about this? He must know of it.
Maybe he wanted to avoid disrupting our training.
Troubled, Eragon wondered what else of import was happening in Ala-gaësia that he was unaware of.
Roran. With a pang of guilt, Eragon real-ized that it had been weeks since he last thought of his cousin,
and even longer since he scryed him on the way to Ellesméra.
At Eragon’s command, the mirror revealed two figures standing against a pure white background. It
took Eragon a long moment to recognize the man on the right as Roran. He was garbed in travel-worn
clothes, a ham-mer was stuck under his belt, a thick beard obscured his face, and he bore a haunted
expression that bespoke desperation. To the left was Jeod. The men surged up and down, accompanied
by the thunderous crash of waves, which masked anything they said. After a while, Roran turned and
walked along what Eragon assumed was the deck of a ship, bringing dozens of other villagers into view.
Where are they, and why is Jeod with them?demanded Eragon, bewil-dered.
Diverting the magic, he scryed in quick succession Teirm—shocked to see that the city’s wharfs had
been destroyed—Therinsford, Garrow’s old farm, and then Carvahall, whereupon Eragon uttered a
wounded cry.
The village was gone.
Every building, including Horst’s magnificent house, had been burned to the ground. Carvahall no longer
existed except as a sooty blot beside the Anora River. The sole remaining inhabitants were four gray
wolves that loped through the wreckage.
The mirror dropped from Eragon’s hand and shattered across the floor. He leaned against Saphira, tears
burning in his eyes as he grieved anew for his lost home. Saphira hummed deep in her chest and brushed

his arm with the side of her jaw, enveloping him in a warm blanket of sympathy. Take comfort, little
one. At least your friends are still alive.
He shuddered and felt a hard core of determination coalesce in his belly. We have remained
sequestered from the world for far too long. It’s high time we leave Ellesméra and confront our
fate, whatever it may be. For now, Roran must fend for himself, but the Varden... the Varden we
can help.
Is it time to fight, Eragon?asked Saphira, an odd note of formality in her voice.
He knew what she meant: Was it time to challenge the Empire head-on, time to kill and rampage to the
limit of their considerable abilities, time to unleash every ounce of their rage until Galbatorix lay dead
before them? Was it time to commit themselves to a campaign that could take decades to resolve?
It is time.
GIFTS

Eragon packed his belongings in less than five minutes. He took the saddle Oromis had given them,
strapped it onto Saphira, then slung his bags over her back and buckled them down.
Saphira tossed her head, nostrils flared, and said, I will wait for you at the field. With a roar, she
launched herself from the tree house, unfolding her blue wings in midair, and flew off, skimming the forest
canopy.
Quick as an elf, Eragon ran to Tialdarí Hall, where he found Orik sit-ting in his usual corner, playing a
game of Runes. The dwarf greeted him with a hearty slap on the arm. “Eragon! What brings you here at
this time of the morn? I thought you’d be off banging swords with Vanir.”
“Saphira and I are leaving,” said Eragon.
Orik stopped with his mouth open, then narrowed his eyes, going seri-ous. “You’ve had news?”
“I’ll tell you about it later. Do you want to come?”
“To Surda?”
“Aye.”
A wide smile broke across Orik’s hairy face. “You’d have to clap me in irons before I’d stay behind.
I’ve done nothing in Ellesméra but grow fat and lazy. A bit of excitement will do me good. When do we
leave?”
“As soon as possible. Gather your things and meet us at the sparring grounds. Can you scrounge up a
week’s worth of provisions for the two of us?”
“A week’s? But that won’t—”
“We’re flying on Saphira.”

Page 645

The skin above Orik’s beard turned pale. “We dwarves don’t do well with heights, Eragon. We don’t
do well at all. It’d be better if we could ride horses, like we did coming here.”
Eragon shook his head. “That would take too long. Besides, it’s easy to ride Saphira. She’ll catch you if
you fall.” Orik grunted, appearing both queasy and unconvinced. Leaving the hall, Eragon sped through
the syl-van city until he rejoined Saphira, and then they flew to the Crags of Tel’naeír.
Oromis was sitting upon Glaedr’s right forearm when they landed in the clearing. The dragon’s scales
gilded the landscape with countless chips of golden light. Neither elf nor dragon stirred. Descending from
Saphira’s back, Eragon bowed. “Master Glaedr. Master Oromis.”
Glaedr said, You have taken it upon yourself to return to the Varden, have you not?
We have,replied Saphira.
Eragon’s sense of betrayal overcame his self-restraint. “Why did you hide the truth from us? Are you so
determined to keep us here that you must resort to such underhand trickery? The Varden are about to be
at-tacked and you didn’t even mention it!”
Calm as ever, Oromis asked, “Do you wish to hear why?”
Very much, Master,said Saphira before Eragon could respond. In pri-vate, she scolded him, growling,
Be polite!
“We withheld the tidings for two reasons. Chief among them was that we ourselves did not know until
nine days past that the Varden were threatened, and the true size, location, and movements of the
Empire’s troops remained concealed from us until three days after that, when Lord Däthedr pierced the
spells Galbatorix used to deceive our scrying.”
“That still doesn’t explain why you said nothing of this.” Eragon scowled. “Not only that, but once you
discovered that the Varden were in danger, why didn’t Islanzadí rouse the elves to fight? Are we not
al-lies?”
“She has roused the elves, Eragon. The forest echoes with the ring of hammers, the tramp of armored
boots, and the grief of those who are about to be parted. For the first time in a century, our race is set to
emerge from Du Weldenvarden and challenge our greatest foe. The time has come for elves to once
more walk openly in Alagaësia.” Gently, Oromis added, “You have been distracted of late, Eragon, and I
under-stand why. Now you must look beyond yourself. The world demands your attention.”
Shamefaced, all Eragon could say was, “I am sorry, Master.” He remem-bered Blagden’s words and
allowed himself a bitter smile. “I’m as blind as a bat.”
“Hardly, Eragon. You have done well, considering the enormous re-sponsibilities we have asked you to
shoulder.” Oromis looked at him gravely. “We expect to receive a missive from Nasuada in the next few
days, requesting assistance from Islanzadí and that you rejoin the Varden. I intended to inform you of the
Varden’s predicament then, when you would still have enough time to reach Surda before swords are
drawn. If I told you earlier, you would have been honor-bound to abandon your training and rush to the
defense of your liegelord. That is why I and Islan-zadí held our tongues.”
“My training won’t matter if the Varden are destroyed.”

Page 646

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“No. But you may be the only person who can prevent them from be-ing destroyed, for a chance
exists—slim but terrible—that Galbatorix will be present at this battle. It is far too late for our warriors to
assist the Varden, which means that if Galbatorix is indeed there, you shall con-front him alone, without
the protection of our spellweavers. Under those circumstances, it seemed vital that your training continue
for as long as possible.”
In an instant, Eragon’s anger melted away and was replaced with a cold, hard, and brutally practical
mind-set as he understood the necessity for Oromis’s silence. Personal feelings were irrelevant in a
situation as dire as theirs. With a flat voice, he said, “You were right. My oath of fealty com-pels me to
ensure the safety of Nasuada and the Varden. However, I’m not ready to confront Galbatorix. Not yet,
at least.”
“My suggestion,” said Oromis, “is that if Galbatorix reveals himself, do everything you can to distract him
from the Varden until the battle is decided for good or for ill and avoid directly fighting him. Before you
go, I ask but one thing: that you and Saphira vow that—once events per-mit—you will return here to
complete your training, for you still have much to learn.”
We shall return,pledged Saphira, binding herself in the ancient lan-guage.
“We shall return,” repeated Eragon, and sealed their fate.
Appearing satisfied, Oromis reached behind himself and produced an embroidered red pouch that he
tugged open. “In anticipation of your de-parture, I gathered together three gifts for you, Eragon.” From
the pouch, he withdrew a silver bottle. “First, some faelnirv I augmented with my own enchantments. This
potion can sustain you when all else fails, and you may find its properties useful in other circumstances as
well. Drink it sparingly, for I only had time to prepare a few mouthfuls.”
He handed the bottle to Eragon, then removed a long black-and-blue sword belt from the pouch. The
belt felt unusually thick and heavy to Eragon when he ran it through his hands. It was made of cloth
threads woven together in an interlocking pattern that depicted a coiling Lianí Vine. At Oromis’s
instruction, Eragon pulled at a tassel at the end of the belt and gasped as a strip in its center slid back to
expose twelve dia-monds, each an inch across. Four diamonds were white, four were black, and the
remainder were red, blue, yellow, and brown. They glittered cold and brilliant, like ice in the dawn,
casting a rainbow of multicolored specks onto Eragon’s hands.
“Master...” Eragon shook his head, at a loss for words for several breaths. “Is it safe to give this to me?”
“Guard it well so that none are tempted to steal it. This is the belt of Beloth the Wise—who you read of
in your history of the Year of Dark-ness—and is one of the great treasures of the Riders. These are the
most perfect gems the Riders could find. Some we traded for with the dwarves. Others we won in battle
or mined ourselves. The stones have no magic of their own, but you may use them as repositories for
your power and draw upon that reserve when in need. This, in addition to the ruby set in Zar’roc’s
pommel, will allow you to amass a store of energy so that you do not become unduly exhausted casting
spells in battle, or even when confronting enemy magicians.”
Last, Oromis brought out a thin scroll protected inside a wooden tube that was decorated with a
bas-relief sculpture of the Menoa tree. Unfurl-ing the scroll, Eragon saw the poem he had recited at the
Agaetí Blödhren. It was lettered in Oromis’s finest calligraphy and illustrated with the elf’s detailed ink
paintings. Plants and animals twined together inside the outline of the first glyph of each quatrain, while
delicate scrollwork traced the columns of words and framed the images.

Page 647

“I thought,” said Oromis, “that you would appreciate a copy for your-self.”
Eragon stood with twelve priceless diamonds in one hand and Oromis’s scroll in the other, and he knew
that it was the scroll he deemed the most precious. Eragon bowed and, reduced to the simplest language
by the depth of his gratitude, said, “Thank you, Master.”
Then Oromis surprised Eragon by initiating the elves’ traditional greet-ing and thereby indicating his
respect for Eragon: “May good fortune rule over you.”
“May the stars watch over you.”
“And may peace live in your heart,” finished the silver-haired elf. He repeated the exchange with
Saphira. “Now go and fly as fast as the north wind, knowing that you—Saphira Brightscales and Eragon
Shadeslayer— carry the blessing of Oromis, last scion of House Thrándurin, he who is both the
Mourning Sage and the Cripple Who Is Whole.”
And mine as well,added Glaedr. Extending his neck, he touched the tip of his nose to Saphira’s, his gold
eyes glittering like swirling pools of em-bers. Remember to keep your heart safe, Saphira. She
hummed in response.
They parted with solemn farewells. Saphira soared over the tangled forest and Oromis and Glaedr
dwindled behind them, lonely on the crags. Despite the hardships of his stay in Ellesméra, Eragon would
miss being among the elves, for with them he had found the closest thing to a home since fleeing Palancar
Valley.
I leave here a changed man,he thought, and closed his eyes, clinging to Saphira.
Before going to meet with Orik, they made one more stop: Tialdarí Hall. Saphira landed in the enclosed
gardens, careful not to damage any of the plants with her tail or claws. Without waiting for her to crouch,
Er-agon leaped straight to the ground, a drop that would have injured him before.
A male elf came out, touched his lips with his first two fingers, and asked if he could help them. When
Eragon replied that he sought an au-dience with Islanzadí, the elf said, “Please wait here, Silver Hand.”
Not five minutes later, the queen herself emerged from the wooded depths of Tialdarí Hall, her crimson
tunic like a drop of blood among the white-robed elf lords and ladies who accompanied her. After the
appro-priate forms of address were observed, she said, “Oromis informed me of your intention to leave
us. I am displeased by this, but one cannot resist the will of fate.”
“No, Your Majesty.... Your Majesty, we came to pay our respects be-fore departing. You have been
most considerate of us, and we thank you and your House for clothing, lodging, and feeding us. We are
in your debt.”
“Never in our debt, Rider. We but repaid a little of what we owe you and the dragons for our miserable
failure in the Fall. I am gratified, though, that you appreciate our hospitality.” She paused. “When you
ar-rive in Surda, convey my royal salutations to Lady Nasuada and King Orrin and inform them that our
warriors will soon attack the northern half of the Empire. If fortune smiles upon us, we shall catch
Galbatorix off guard and, given time, divide his forces.”
“As you wish.”

Page 648

“Also, know that I have dispatched twelve of our finest spellweavers to Surda. If you are still alive when
they arrive, they will place themselves under your command and do their best to shield you from danger
both night and day.”
“Thank you, Your Majesty.”
Islanzadí extended a hand and one of the elf lords handed her a shallow, unadorned wooden box.
“Oromis had his gifts for you, and I have mine. Let them remind you of your time spent with us under the
dusky pines.” She opened the box, revealing a long, dark bow with reflexed limbs and curled tips nestled
on a bed of velvet. Silver fittings chased with dogwood leaves decorated the ears and grip of the bow.
Beside it lay a quiver of new arrows fletched with white swan feathers. “Now that you share our strength,
it seems only proper that you should have one of our bows. I sang it myself from a yew tree. The string
will never break. And so long as you use these arrows, you will be hard-pressed to miss your target,
even if the wind should gust during your shot.”
Once again, Eragon was overwhelmed by the elves’ generosity. He bowed. “What can I say, my Lady?
You honor me that you saw fit to give me the labor of your own hands.”
Islanzadí nodded, as if agreeing with him, then stepped past him and said, “Saphira, I brought you no
gifts because I could think of nothing you might need or want, but if there is aught of ours you desire,
name it and it shall be yours.”
Dragons,said Saphira, do not require possessions to be happy. What use have we for riches when
our hides are more glorious than any treasure hoard in existence? No, I am content with the
kindness that you have shown Er-agon.
Then Islanzadí bade them a safe journey. Sweeping around, her red cape billowing from her shoulders,
she made to leave the gardens, only to stop at the edge of the pleasance and say, “And, Eragon?”
“Yes, Your Majesty?”
“When you meet with Arya, please express my affection to her and tell her that she is sorely missed in
Ellesméra.” The words were stiff and for-mal. Without waiting for a reply, she strode away and
disappeared among the shadowed boles that guarded the interior of Tialdarí Hall, followed by the elf
lords and ladies.
It took Saphira less than a minute to fly to the sparring field, where Orik sat on his bulging pack, tossing
his war ax from one hand to the other and scowling ferociously. “About time you got here,” he grumbled.
He stood and slipped the ax back under his belt. Eragon apologized for the delay, then tied Orik’s pack
onto the back of his saddle. The dwarf eyed Saphira’s shoulder, which loomed high above him. “And
how, by Morgothal’s black beard, am I supposed to get up there? A cliff has more handholds than you,
Saphira.”
Here,she said. She lay flat on her belly and pushed her right hind leg out as far as she could, forming a
knobby ramp. Pulling himself onto her shin with a loud huff, Orik crawled up her leg on hands and
knees. A small jet of flame burst from Saphira’s nostrils as she snorted. Hurry up— that tickles!
Orik paused on the ledge of her haunches, then placed one foot on ei-ther side of Saphira’s spine and
carefully walked his way up her back to-ward the saddle. He tapped one of the ivory spikes between his
legs and said, “There be as good a way to lose your manhood as ever I’ve seen.”

Page 649

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Eragon grinned. “Don’t slip.” When Orik lowered himself onto the front of the saddle, Eragon mounted
Saphira and sat behind the dwarf. To hold Orik in place when Saphira turned or inverted, Eragon
loosened the thongs that were meant to secure his arms and had Orik put his legs through them.
As Saphira rose to her full height, Orik swayed, then clutched the spike in front of him. “Garr! Eragon,
don’t let me open my eyes until we’re in the air, else I fear I’ll be sick. This is unnatural, it is. Dwarves
aren’t meant to ride dragons. It’s never been done before.”
“Never?”
Orik shook his head without answering.
Clusters of elves drifted out of Du Weldenvarden, gathered along the edge of the field, and with solemn
expressions watched Saphira lift her translucent wings in preparation to take off.
Eragon tightened his grip as he felt her mighty thews bunch underneath his legs. With a rush of
acceleration, Saphira launched herself into the az-ure sky, flapping swift and hard to rise above the giant
trees. She wheeled over the vast forest—spiraling upward as she gained altitude—and then aimed herself
south, toward the Hadarac Desert.
Though the wind was loud in Eragon’s ears, he heard an elf woman in Ellesméra raise her clear voice in
song, as he had when they first arrived. She sang:
Away, away, you shall fly away,
O’er the peaks and vales
To the lands beyond.
Away, away, you shall fly away,
And never return to me....
THE MAW OF THE OCEAN

The obsidian seas heaved underneath the Dragon Wing, propelling the ship high in the air. There it
teetered on the precipitous crest of a foam-capped swell before pitching forward and racing down the
face of the wave into the black trough below. Billows of stinging mist drove through the frigid air as the
wind groaned and howled like a monstrous spirit.
Roran clung to the starboard rigging at the waist of the ship and retched over the gunwale; nothing came
up but sour bile. He had prided himself that his stomach never bothered him while on Clovis’s barges, but
the storm they raced before was so violent that even Uthar’s men— seasoned tars each and every
one—had difficulty keeping their whisky down.
It felt like a boulder of ice clouted Roran between the shoulder blades as a wave struck the ship
crossways, drenching the deck before draining through the scuppers and pouring back into the frothing,
furrowed, furi-ous ocean from whence it came. Roran wiped the salty water from his eyes with fingers as

clumsy as frozen lumps of wood, and squinted to-ward the inky horizon to the aft.
Maybe this will shake them off our scent.Three black-sailed sloops had pursued them ever since they
passed the Iron Cliffs and rounded what Jeod dubbed Edur Carthungavë and Uthar identified as
Rathbar’s Spur. “The tailbone of the Spine, that’s what it be,” Uthar said, grinning. The sloops were
faster than the Dragon Wing, weighed down with villagers as it was, and had quickly gained upon the
merchant ship until they were close enough to exchange volleys of arrows. Worst of all, it seemed that the
lead sloop carried a magician, for its arrows were uncannily accurate, splitting ropes, destroying ballistae,
and clogging the blocks. From their attacks, Roran deduced that the Empire no longer cared about
capturing him and only wanted to stop him from finding sanctuary with the Varden. He had just been
preparing the villagers to repel boarding parties when the clouds above ripened to a bruised purple,
heavy with rain, and a ravening tempest blew in from the northwest. At the present, Uthar had the
Dragon Wing tacked crossways to the wind, heading toward the Southern Isles, where he hoped to
elude the sloops among the shoals and coves of Beirland.
A sheet of horizontal lightning flickered between two bulbous thun-derheads, and the world became a
tableau of pale marble before darkness reigned once more. Every blinding flash imprinted a motionless
scene upon Roran’s eyes that lingered, pulsing, long after the brazen bolts van-ished.
Then came another round of forked lightning, and Roran saw—as if in a series of monochrome
paintings—the mizzen topmast twist, crack, and topple into the thrashing sea, port amidships. Grabbing a
lifeline, Roran pulled himself to the quarterdeck and, in unison with Bonden, hacked through the cables
that still connected the topmast to the Dragon Wing and dragged the stern low in the water. The ropes
writhed like snakes as they were cut.
Afterward, Roran sank to the deck, his right arm hooked through the gunwale to hold himself in place as
the ship dropped twenty... thirty... feet between waves. A swell washed over him, leaching the warmth
from his bones. Shivers racked his body.
Don’t let me die here,he pleaded, though whom he addressed, he knew not. Not in these cruel waves.
My task is yet unfinished. During that long night, he clung to his memories of Katrina, drawing solace
from them when he grew weary and hope threatened to desert him.
The storm lasted two full days and broke during the wee hours of the night. The following morning
brought with it a pale green dawn, clear skies, and three black sails riding the northern horizon. To the
southwest, the hazy outline of Beirland lay underneath a shelf of clouds gathered about the ridged
mountain that dominated the island.
Roran, Jeod, and Uthar met in a small fore cabin—since the captain’s stateroom was given over to the
infirm—where Uthar unrolled sea charts on the table and tapped a point above Beirland. “This’d be
where we are now,” he said. He reached for a larger map of Alagaësia’s coastline and tapped the mouth
of the Jiet River. “An’ this’d be our destination, since food won’t last us to Reavstone. How we get
there, though, without be-ing overtaken is beyond me. Without our mizzen topgallant, those ac-cursed
sloops will catch us by noon tomorrow, evening if we manage the sails well.”
“Can we replace the mast?” asked Jeod. “Vessels of this size carry spars to make just such repairs.”
Uthar shrugged. “We could, provided we had a proper ship’s carpenter among us. Seeing as we don’t,
I’d rather not let inexperienced hands mount a spar, only to have it crash down on deck and perhaps
injure somebody.”

Page 651

Roran said, “If it weren’t for the magician or magicians, I’d say we should stand and fight, since we far
outnumber the crews of the sloops. As it is, I’m chary of battle. It seems unlikely that we could prevail,
con-sidering how many ships sent to help the Varden have disappeared.”
Grunting, Uthar drew a circle around their current position. “This’d be how far we can sail by tomorrow
evening, assuming the wind stays with us. We could make landfall somewhere on Beirland or Nía if we
wanted, but I can’t see how that’d help us. We’d be trapped. The soldiers on those sloops or the Ra’zac
or Galbatorix himself could hunt us at his leisure.”
Roran scowled as he considered their options; a fight with the sloops appeared inevitable.
For several minutes, the cabin was silent except for the slap of waves against the hull. Then Jeod placed
his finger on the map between Beir-land and Nía, looked at Uthar, and asked, “What about the Boar’s
Eye?”
To Roran’s amazement, the scarred sailor actually blanched. “I’d not risk that, Master Jeod, not on my
life. I’d rather face the sloops an’ die in the open sea than go to that doomed place. There has consumed
twice as many ships as in Galbatorix’s fleet.”
“I seem to recall reading,” said Jeod, leaning back in his chair, “that the passage is perfectly safe at high
tide and low tide. Is that not so?”
With great and evident reluctance, Uthar admitted, “Aye. But the Eye is so wide, it requires the most
precise timing to cross without being de-stroyed. We’d be hard-pressed to accomplish that with the
sloops near on our tail.”
“If we could, though,” pressed Jeod, “if we could time it right, the sloops would be wrecked or—if their
nerve failed them—forced to cir-cumvent Nía. It would give us time to find a place to hide along
Beir-land.”
“If, if... You’d send us to the crushing deep, you would.”
“Come now, Uthar, your fear is unreasoning. What I propose is danger-ous, I admit, but no more than
fleeing Teirm was. Or do you doubt your ability to sail the gap? Are you not man enough to do it?”
Uthar crossed his bare arms. “You’ve never seen the Eye, have you, sir?”
“I can’t say I have.”
“It’s not that I’m not man enough, but that the Eye far exceeds the strength of men; it puts to shame our
biggest ships, our grandest build-ings, an’ anything else you’d care to name. Tempting it would be like
try-ing to outrun an avalanche; you might succeed, but then you just as well might be ground into dust.”
“What,” asked Roran, “is this Boar’s Eye?”
“The all-devouring maw of the ocean,” proclaimed Uthar.
In a milder tone, Jeod said, “It’s a whirlpool, Roran. The Eye forms as the result of tidal currents that
collide between Beirland and Nía. When the tide waxes, the Eye rotates north to west. When the tide
wanes, it rotates north to east.”

Page 652

“That doesn’t sound so dangerous.”
Uthar shook his head, queue whipping the sides of his wind-burned neck, and laughed. “Not so
dangerous, he says! Ha!”
“What you fail to comprehend,” continued Jeod, “is the size of the vor-tex. On average, the center of the
Eye is a league in diameter, while the arms of the pool can be anywhere from ten to fifteen miles across.
Ships unlucky enough to be snared by the Eye are borne down to the floor of the ocean and dashed
against the jagged rocks therein. Remnants of the vessels are often found as flotsam on the beaches of the
two islands.”
“Would anyone expect us to take this route?” Roran queried.
“No, an’ for good reason,” growled Uthar. Jeod shook his head at the same time.
“Is it even possible for us to cross the Eye?”
“It’d be a blasted fool thing to do.”
Roran nodded. “I know it’s not something you want to risk, Uthar, but our options are limited. I’m no
seaman, so I must rely upon your judg-ment: Can we cross the Eye?”
The captain hesitated. “Maybe, maybe not. You’d have t’ be stark raving mad to go nearer’n five miles
of that monster.”
Pulling out his hammer, Roran banged it on the table, leaving a dent a half-inch deep. “Then I’m stark
raving mad!” He held Uthar’s gaze until the sailor shifted with discomfort. “Must I remind you, we’ve
only gotten this far by doing what quibbling worrywarts said couldn’t, or shouldn’t, be done? We of
Carvahall dared to abandon our homes and cross the Spine. Jeod dared to imagine we could steal the
Dragon Wing. What will you dare, Uthar? If we can brave the Eye and live to tell the tale, you shall be
hailed as one of the greatest mariners in history. Now answer me and answer me well and true: Can this
be done?”
Uthar drew a hand over his face. When he spoke, it was in a low voice, as if Roran’s outburst had
caused him to abandon all bluster. “I don’t know, Stronghammer.... If we wait for the Eye to subside, the
sloops may be so close to us that if we escape, they’d escape. An’ if the wind should falter, we’d be
caught in the current, unable to break free.”
“As captain, are you willing to attempt it? Neither Jeod nor I can command the Dragon Wing in your
place.”
Long did Uthar stare down at the charts, one hand clasped over the other. He drew a line or two from
their position and worked a table of figures that Roran could make nothing of. At last he said, “I fear we
sail to our doom, but aye, I’ll do my best to see us through.”
Satisfied, Roran put away his hammer. “So be it.”
RUNNING THE BOAR’S EYE

Page 653

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

The sloops continued to draw closer to the Dragon Wing over the course of the day. Roran watched
their progress whenever he could, con-cerned that they would get near enough to attack before the
Dragon Wing reached the Eye. Still, Uthar seemed able to outrun them, at least for a little while longer.
At Uthar’s orders, Roran and the other villagers worked to tidy up the ship after the storm and prepare
for the ordeal that was to come. Their work ended at nightfall, when they extinguished every light on
board in an attempt to confuse their pursuers as to the Dragon Wing ’s heading. The ruse succeeded in
part, for when the sun rose, Roran saw that the sloops had fallen back to the northwest another mile or
so, though they soon made up the lost distance.
Late that morning, Roran climbed the mainmast and pulled himself up into the crow’s nest a hundred and
thirty feet above the deck, so high that the men below appeared no larger than his little finger. The water
and sky seemed to rock perilously about him as the Dragon Wing heeled from side to side.
Taking out the spyglass he had brought with him, Roran put it to his eye and adjusted it until the sloops
came into focus not four miles astern and approaching faster than he would have liked. They must have
realized what we intend to do, he thought. Sweeping the glass around, he searched the ocean for any
sign of the Boar’s Eye. He stopped as he descried a great disk of foam the size of an island, gyrating
from north to east. We’re late, he thought, a pit in his stomach. High tide had already passed and the
Boar’s Eye was gathering in speed and strength as the ocean withdrew from land. Roran trained the glass
over the edge of the crow’s nest and saw that the knotted rope Uthar had tied to the starboard side of
the stern—to detect when they entered the pull of the whirlpool—now floated alongside the Dragon
Wing instead of trailing behind as was usual. The one thing in their favor was that they were sailing with
the Eye’s current and not against it. If it had been the other way around, they would have had no choice
but to wait until the tide turned.
Below, Roran heard Uthar shout for the villagers to man the oars. A moment later, the Dragon Wing
sprouted two rows of poles along each side, making the ship look like nothing more than a giant water
strider. At the beat of an ox-hide drum, accompanied by Bonden’s rhythmic chant as he set the tempo,
the oars arched forward, dipped into the sea of green, and swept back across the surface of the water,
leaving white streaks of bubbles in their wake. The Dragon Wing accelerated quickly, now moving faster
than the sloops, which were still outside the Eye’s in-fluence.
Roran watched with horrified fascination the play that unfolded around him. The essential plot element,
the crux upon which the outcome de-pended, was time. Though they were late, was the Dragon Wing,
with its oars and sails combined, fast enough to traverse the Eye? And could the sloops—which had
deployed their own oars now—narrow the gap be-tween them and the Dragon Wing enough to ensure
their own survival? He could not tell. The pounding drum measured out the minutes; Roran was acutely
aware of each moment as it trickled by.
He was surprised when an arm reached over the edge of the basket and Baldor’s face appeared,
looking up at him. “Give me a hand, won’t you? I feel like I’m about to fall.”
Bracing himself, Roran helped Baldor into the basket. Baldor handed Roran a biscuit and a dried apple
and said, “Thought you might like some lunch.” With a nod of thanks, Roran tore into the biscuit and
resumed gazing through the spyglass. When Baldor asked, “Can you see the Eye?” Roran passed him the
glass and concentrated on eating.
Over the next half hour, the foam disk increased the speed of its revo-lutions until it spun like a top. The
water around the foam bulged and began to rise, while the foam itself sank from view into the bottom of a
gigantic pit that continued to deepen and enlarge. The air over the vortex filled with a cyclone of twisting

Page 654

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

mist, and from the ebony throat of the abyss came a tortured howl like the cries of an injured wolf.
The speed with which the Boar’s Eye formed amazed Roran. “You’d better go tell Uthar,” he said.
Baldor climbed out of the nest. “Tie yourself to the mast or you may get thrown off.”
“I will.”
Roran left his arms free when he secured himself, making sure that, if needed, he could reach his belt
knife to cut himself free. Anxiety filled him as he surveyed the situation. The Dragon Wing was but a mile
past the median of the Eye, the sloops were but two miles behind her, and the Eye itself was quickly
building toward its full fury. Worse, disrupted by the whirlpool, the wind sputtered and gasped, blowing
first from one di-rection and then the other. The sails billowed for a moment, then fell slack, then filled
again as the confused wind swirled about the ship.
Perhaps Uthar was right,thought Roran. Perhaps I’ve gone too far and pitted myself against an
opponent that cannot be overcome by sheer deter-mination. Perhaps I am sending the villagers to
their deaths. The forces of nature were immune to intimidation.
The gaping center of the Boar’s Eye was now almost nine and a half miles in circumference, and how
many fathoms deep no one could say, except for those who had been trapped within it. The sides of the
Eye slanted inward at a forty-five-degree angle; they were striated with shal-low grooves, like wet clay
being molded on a potter’s wheel. The bass howl grew louder, until it seemed to Roran that the entire
world must crumble to pieces from the intensity of the vibrations. A glorious rain-bow emerged from the
mist over the whirling chasm.
The current moved faster than ever, driving the Dragon Wing at a breakneck pace as it whipped around
the rim of the whirlpool and mak-ing it more and more unlikely that the ship could break free at the Eye’s
southern edge. So prodigious was her velocity, the Dragon Wing tilted far to the starboard, suspending
Roran out over the rushing water.
Despite the Dragon Wing ’s progress, the sloops continued to gain on her. The enemy ships sailed
abreast less than a mile away, their oars mov-ing in perfect accord, two fins of water flying from each
prow as they plowed the ocean. Roran could not help but admire the sight.
He tucked the spyglass away in his shirt; he had no need of it now. The sloops were close enough for
the naked eye, while the whirlpool was in-creasingly obscured by the clouds of white vapor thrown off
the lip of the funnel. As it was pulled into the deep, the vapor formed a spiral lens over the gulf, mimicking
the whirlpool’s appearance.
Then the Dragon Wing tacked port, diverging from the current in Uthar’s bid for the open sea. The keel
chattered across the puckered wa-ter, and the ship’s speed dropped in half as the Dragon Wing fought
the deadly embrace of the Boar’s Eye. A shudder ran up the mast, jarring Ro-ran’s teeth, and the crow’s
nest swung in the new direction, making him giddy with vertigo.
Fear gripped Roran when they continued to slow. He slashed off his bindings and—with reckless
disregard for his own safety—swung himself over the edge of the basket, grabbed the ropes underneath,
and shinnied down the rigging so quickly that he lost his grip once and fell several feet before he could
catch himself. He jumped to the deck, ran to the fore hatchway, and descended to the first bank of oars,
where he joined Bal-dor and Albriech on an oak pole.

Page 655

They said not a word, but labored to the sound of their own desperate breathing, the frenzied beat of the
drum, Bonden’s hoarse shouts, and the roar of the Boar’s Eye. Roran could feel the mighty whirlpool
resisting with every stroke of the oar.
And yet their efforts could not keep the Dragon Wing from coming to a virtual standstill. We’re not
going to make it, thought Roran. His back and legs burned from the exertion. His lungs stabbed.
Between the drumbeats, he heard Uthar ordering the hands above deck to trim the sails to take full
advantage of the fickle wind.
Two places ahead of Roran, Darmmen and Hamund surrendered their oar to Thane and Ridley, then lay
in the middle of the aisle, their limbs trembling. Less than a minute later, someone else collapsed farther
down the gallery and was immediately replaced by Birgit and another woman.
If we survive,thought Roran, it’ll only be because we have enough people to sustain this pace
however long is necessary.
It seemed an eternity that he worked the oar in the murky, smoky room, first pushing, then pulling, doing
his best to ignore the pain mount-ing within his body. His neck ached from hunching underneath the low
ceiling. The dark wood of the pole was streaked with blood where his skin had blistered and torn. He
ripped off his shirt—dropping the spy-glass to the floor—wrapped the cloth around the oar, and
continued row-ing.
At last Roran could do no more. His legs gave way and he fell on his side, slipping across the aisle
because he was so sweaty. Orval took his place. Roran lay still until his breath returned, then pushed
himself onto his hands and knees and crawled to the hatchway.
Like a fever-mad drunk, he pulled himself up the ladder, swaying with the motion of the ship and often
slumping against the wall to rest. When he came out on deck, he took a brief moment to appreciate the
fresh air, then staggered aft to the helm, his legs threatening to cramp with every step.
“How goes it?” he gasped to Uthar, who manned the wheel.
Uthar shook his head.
Peering over the gunwale, Roran espied the three sloops perhaps a half mile away and slightly more to
the west, closer to the center of the Eye. The sloops appeared motionless in relation to the Dragon
Wing.
At first, as Roran watched, the positions of the four ships remained un-changed. Then he sensed a shift
in the Dragon Wing ’s speed, as if the ship had crossed some crucial point and the forces restraining her
had diminished. It was a subtle difference and amounted to little more than a few additional feet per
minute—but it was enough that the distance be-tween the Dragon Wing and the sloops began to
increase. With every stroke of the oars, the Dragon Wing gained momentum.
The sloops, however, could not overcome the whirlpool’s dreadful strength. Their oars gradually slowed
until, one by one, the ships drifted backward and were drawn toward the veil of mist, beyond which
waited the gyrating walls of ebony water and the gnashing rocks at the bottom of the ocean floor.
They can’t keep rowing,realized Roran. Their crews are too small and they’re too tired. He could not
help but feel a pang of sympathy for the fate of the men on the sloops.

Page 656

At that precise instant, an arrow sprang from the nearest sloop and burst into green flame as it raced
toward the Dragon Wing. The dart must have been sustained by magic to have flown so far. It struck the
mizzen sail and exploded into globules of liquid fire that stuck to what-ever they touched. Within seconds,
twenty small fires burned along the mizzenmast, the mizzen sail, and the deck below.
“We can’t put it out,” shouted one of the sailors with a panicked ex-pression.
“Chop off whatever’s burning an’ throw it overboard!” roared Uthar in reply.
Unsheathing his belt knife, Roran set to work excising a dollop of green fire from the boards by his feet.
Several tense minutes elapsed before the unnatural blazes were removed and it became clear that the
conflagra-tions would not spread to the rest of the ship.
Once the cry of “All clear!” was sounded, Uthar relaxed his grip on the steering wheel. “If that was the
best their magician can do, then I’d say we have nothing more to fear of him.”
“We’re going to get out of the Eye, aren’t we?” asked Roran, eager to confirm his hope.
Uthar squared his shoulders and flashed a quick grin, both proud and disbelieving. “Not quite this cycle,
but we’ll be close. We won’t make real progress away from that gaping monster until the tide slacks off.
Go tell Bonden to lower the tempo a bit; I don’t want them fainting at the oars if’n I can help it.”
And so it was. Roran took another shift rowing and, by the time he re-turned to the deck, the whirlpool
was subsiding. The vortex’s ghastly howl faded into the usual noise of the wind; the water assumed a
calm, flat quality that betrayed no hint of the habitual violence visited upon that location; and the
contorted fog that had writhed above the abyss melted under the warm rays of the sun, leaving the air as
clear as oiled glass. Of the Boar’s Eye itself—as Roran saw when he retrieved the spy-glass from among
the rowers—nothing remained but the selfsame disk of yellow foam rotating upon the water.
And in the center of the foam, he thought he could discern, just barely, three broken masts and a black
sail floating round and round and round in an endless circle. But it might have been his imagination.
Leastways, that’s what he told himself.
Elain came up beside him, one hand resting on her swollen belly. In a small voice, she said, “We were
lucky, Roran, more lucky than we had reason to expect.”
“Aye,” he agreed.
TO ABERON

Underneath Saphira, the pathless forest stretched wide to each white horizon, fading as it did from the
deepest green to a hazy, washed-out purple. Martins, rooks, and other woodland birds flitted above the
gnarled pines, uttering shrieks of alarm when they beheld Saphira. She flew low to the canopy in order to
protect her two passengers from the arctic temperatures in the upper reaches of the sky.
Except for when Saphira fled the Ra’zac into the Spine, this was the first time she and Eragon had had
the opportunity to fly together over a great stretch of distance without having to stop or hold back for
compan-ions on the ground. Saphira was especially pleased with the trip, and she delighted in showing

Page 657

Eragon how Glaedr’s tutelage had enhanced her strength and endurance.
After his initial discomfort abated, Orik said to Eragon, “I doubt I could ever be comfortable in the air,
but I can understand why you and Saphira enjoy it so. Flying makes you feel free and unfettered, like a
fierce-eyed hawk hunting his prey! It sets my heart a-pounding, it does.”
To reduce the tedium of the journey, Orik played a game of riddles with Saphira. Eragon excused
himself from the contest as he had never been particularly adept at riddles; the twist of thought necessary
to solve them always seemed to escape him. In this, Saphira far exceeded him. As most dragons are, she
was fascinated by puzzles and found them quite easy to unravel.
Orik said, “The only riddles I know are in Dwarvish. I will do mine best to translate them, but the results
may be rough and unwieldy.” Then he asked:
Tall I am young.
Short I am old.
While with life I do glow,
Urûr’s breath is my foe.
Not fair,growled Saphira. I know little of your gods. Eragon had no need
to repeat her words, for Orik had granted permission for her to project them directly into his mind.
Orik laughed. “Do you give up?”
Never.For a few minutes, the only sound was the sweep of her wings, until she asked, Is it a candle?
“Right you are.”
A puff of hot smoke floated back into Orik’s and Eragon’s faces as she snorted. I do poorly with such
riddles. I’ve not been inside a house since the day I hatched, and I find enigmas difficult that deal
with domestic subjects. Next she offered:
What herb cures all ailments?
This proved a terrible poser for Orik. He grumbled and groaned and gnashed his teeth in frustration.
Behind him, Eragon could not help but grin, for he saw the answer plain in Saphira’s mind. Finally, Orik
said, “Well, what is it? You have bested me with this.”
By the black raven’s crime, and by this rhyme,
the answer would be thyme.
Now it was Orik’s turn to cry, “Not fair! This is not mine native tongue. You cannot expect me to grasp
such wordplay!”
Fair is fair. It was a proper riddle.

Page 658

Eragon watched the muscles at the back of Orik’s neck bunch and knot as the dwarf jutted his head
forward. “If that is your stance, O Irontooth, then I’d have you solve this riddle that every dwarf child
knows.”
I am named Morgothal’s Forge and Helzvog’s Womb.
I veil Nordvig’s Daughter and bring gray death, And make the world anew with Helzvog’s Blood.
What be I?
And so they went, exchanging riddles of increasing difficulty while Du Weldenvarden sped past below.
Gaps in the thatched branches often re-vealed patches of silver, sections of the many rivers that threaded
the for-est. Around Saphira, the clouds billowed in a fantastic architecture: vault-ing arches, domes, and
columns; crenelated ramparts; towers the size of mountains; and ridges and valleys suffused with a
glowing light that made Eragon feel as if they flew through a dream.
So fast was Saphira that, when dusk arrived, they had already left Du Weldenvarden behind and entered
the auburn fields that separated the great forest from the Hadarac Desert. They made their camp among
the grass and hunkered round their small fire, utterly alone upon the flat face of the earth. They were
grim-faced and said little, for words only empha-sized their insignificance in that bare and empty land.
Eragon took advantage of their stop to store some of his energy in the ruby that adorned Zar’roc’s
pommel. The gem absorbed all the power he gave it, as well as Saphira’s when she lent her strength. It
would, con-cluded Eragon, be a number of days before they could saturate both the ruby and the twelve
diamonds concealed within the belt of Beloth the Wise.
Weary from the exercise, he wrapped himself in blankets, lay beside Saphira, and drifted into his waking
sleep, where his night phantasms played out against the sea of stars above.
Soon after they resumed their journey the following morning, the rip-pling grass gave way to tan scrub,
which grew ever more scarce until, in turn, it was replaced by sunbaked ground bare of all but the most
hardy plants. Reddish gold dunes appeared. From his vantage on Saphira, they looked to Eragon like
lines of waves forever sailing toward a distant shore.
As the sun began its descent, he noticed a cluster of mountains in the distant east and knew he beheld
Du Fells Nángoröth, where the wild dragons had gone to mate, to raise their young, and eventually to
die. We must visit there someday, said Saphira, following his gaze.
Aye.
That night, Eragon felt their solitude even more keenly than before, for they were camped in the emptiest
region of the Hadarac Desert, where so little moisture existed in the air that his lips soon cracked, though
he smeared them with nalgask every few minutes. He sensed little life in the ground, only a handful of
miserable plants interspersed with a few insects and lizards.
As he had when they fled Gil’ead through the desert, Eragon drew wa-ter from the soil to replenish their
waterskins, and before he allowed the water to drain away, he scryed Nasuada in the pool’s reflection to
see if the Varden had been attacked yet. To his relief, they had not.
On the third day since leaving Ellesméra, the wind rose up behind them and wafted Saphira farther than
she could have flown on her own, carrying them entirely out of the Hadarac Desert.

Near the edge of the waste, they passed over a number of horse-mounted nomads who were garbed in
flowing robes to ward against the heat. The men shouted in their rough tongue and shook their swords
and spears at Saphira, though none of them dared loose an arrow at her.
Eragon, Saphira, and Orik bivouacked for the night at the southernmost end of Silverwood Forest,
which lay along Lake Tüdosten and was named so because it was composed almost entirely of beeches,
willows, and trembling poplars. In contrast to the endless twilight that lay beneath the brooding pines of
Du Weldenvarden, Silverwood was filled with bright sunshine, larks, and the gentle rustling of green
leaves. The trees seemed young and happy to Eragon, and he was glad to be there. And though all signs
of the desert had vanished, the weather remained far warmer than he was accustomed to at that time of
year. It felt more like summer than spring.
From there they flew straight to Aberon, the capital of Surda, guided by directions Eragon gleaned from
the memories of birds they encoun-tered. Saphira made no attempt to conceal herself along the way, and
they often heard cries of amazement and alarm from the villages she swept over.
It was late afternoon when they arrived at Aberon, a low, walled city centered around a bluff in an
otherwise flat landscape. Borromeo Castle occupied the top of the bluff. The rambling citadel was
protected by three concentric layers of walls, numerous towers, and, Eragon noted, hundreds of ballistae
made for shooting down a dragon. The rich amber light from the low sun cast Aberon’s buildings in sharp
relief and illumi-nated a plume of dust rising from the city’s western gate, where a line of soldiers sought
entrance.
As Saphira descended toward the inner ward of the castle, she brought Eragon into contact with the
combined thoughts of the people in the capital. The noise overwhelmed him at first—how was he
supposed to listen for foes and still function at the same time?—until he realized that, as usual, he was
concentrating too much on specifics. All he had to do was sense people’s general intentions. He
broadened his focus, and the individual voices clamoring for his attention subsided into a continuum of the
emotions surrounding him. It was like a sheet of water that lay draped over the nearby landscape,
undulating with the rise and fall of people’s feelings and spiking whenever someone was racked by
extremes of passion.
Thus, Eragon was aware of the alarm that gripped the people below as word of Saphira spread.
Careful, he told her. We don’t want them to at-tack us.
Dirt billowed into the air with each beat of Saphira’s powerful wings as she settled in the middle of the
courtyard, sinking her claws into the bare ground to steady herself. The horses tethered in the yard
neighed with fear, creating such an uproar that Eragon finally inserted himself in their minds and calmed
them with words from the ancient language.
Eragon dismounted after Orik, eyeing the many soldiers that lined the parapets and the drawn ballistae
they manned. He did not fear the weap-ons, but he had no desire to become engaged in a fight with his
allies.
A group of twelve men, some soldiers, hurried out of the keep toward Saphira. They were led by a tall
man with the same dark skin as Nasuada, only the third person Eragon had met with such a complexion.
Halting ten paces away, the man bowed—as did his followers—then said, “Wel-come, Rider. I am
Dahwar, son of Kedar. I am King Orrin’s seneschal.”
Eragon inclined his head. “And I, Eragon Shadeslayer, son of none.”

“And I, Orik, Thrifk’s son.”
And I, Saphira, daughter of Vervada,said Saphira, using Eragon as her mouthpiece.
Dahwar bowed again. “I apologize that no one of higher rank than my-self is present to greet guests as
noble as you, but King Orrin, Lady Nasuada, and all the Varden have long since marched to confront
Galba-torix’s army.” Eragon nodded. He had expected as much. “They left or-ders that if you came here
seeking them, you should join them directly, for your prowess is needed if we are to prevail.”
“Can you show us on a map how to find them?” asked Eragon.
“Of course, sir. While I have that fetched, would you care to step out of the heat and partake of some
refreshments?”
Eragon shook his head. “We have no time to waste. Besides, it is not I who needs to see the map but
Saphira, and I doubt she would fit in your halls.”
That seemed to catch the seneschal off guard. He blinked and ran his eyes over Saphira, then said,
“Quite right, sir. In either case, our hospital-ity is yours. If there is aught you and your companions desire,
you have but to ask.”
For the first time, Eragon realized that he could issue commands and expect them to be followed. “We
need a week’s worth of provisions. For me, only fruit, vegetables, flour, cheese, bread—things like that.
We also need our waterskins refilled.” He was impressed that Dahwar did not question his avoidance of
meat. Orik added his requests then for jerky, bacon, and other such products.
Snapping his fingers, Dahwar sent two servants running back into the keep to collect the supplies. While
everyone in the ward waited for the men to return, he asked, “May I assume by your presence here,
Shade-slayer, that you completed your training with the elves?”
“My training shall never end so long as I’m alive.”
“I see.” Then, after a moment, Dahwar said, “Please excuse my imperti-nence, sir, for I am ignorant of
the ways of the Riders, but are you not human? I was told you were.”
“That he is,” growled Orik. “He was... changed. And you should be glad he was, or our predicament
would be far worse than it is.” Dahwar was tactful enough not to pursue the subject, but from his
thoughts Eragon concluded that the seneschal would have paid a handsome price for fur-ther
details—any information about Eragon or Saphira was valuable in Orrin’s government.
The food, water, and map were soon brought by two wide-eyed pages. At Eragon’s word, they
deposited the items beside Saphira, looking terri-bly frightened as they did, then retreated behind
Dahwar. Kneeling on the ground, Dahwar unrolled the map—which depicted Surda and the neighboring
lands—and drew a line northwest from Aberon to Cithrí. He said, “Last I heard, King Orrin and Lady
Nasuada stopped here for prov-ender. They did not intend to stay, however, because the Empire is
ad-vancing south along the Jiet River and they wished to be in place to con-front Galbatorix’s army when
it arrives. The Varden could be anywhere between Cithrí and the Jiet River. This is only my humble
opinion, but I would say the best place to look for them would be the Burning Plains.”
“The Burning Plains?”

Page 661

Dahwar smiled. “You may know them by their old name, then, the name the elves use: Du Völlar
Eldrvarya.”
“Ah, yes.” Now Eragon remembered. He had read about them in one of the histories Oromis assigned
him. The plains—which contained huge deposits of peat—lay along the eastern side of the Jiet River
where Surda’s border crossed it and had been the site of a skirmish between the Riders and the
Forsworn. During the fight, the dragons inadvertently lit the peat with the flames from their mouths and
the fire had burrowed underground, where it remained smoldering ever since. The land had been
rendered uninhabitable by the noxious fumes that poured out of the glowing vents in the charred earth.
A shiver crawled down Eragon’s left side as he recalled his premonition: banks of warriors colliding
upon an orange and yellow field, accompanied by the harsh screams of gore-crows and the whistle of
black arrows. He shivered again. Fate is converging upon us, he said to Saphira. Then, ges-turing at
the map: Have you seen enough?
I have.
In short order, he and Orik packed the supplies, remounted Saphira, and from her back thanked
Dahwar for his service. As Saphira was about to take off again, Eragon frowned; a note of discord had
entered the minds he was monitoring. “Dahwar, two grooms in the stables have got-ten into an argument
and one of them, Tathal, intends to commit mur-der. You can stop him, though, if you send men right
away.”
Dahwar widened his eyes in an expression of astonishment, and even Orik twisted round to look at
Eragon. The seneschal asked, “How do you know this, Shadeslayer?”
Eragon merely said, “Because I am a Rider.”
Then Saphira unfurled her wings, and everyone on the ground ran back to avoid being battered by the
rush of air as she flapped downward and soared into the sky. As Borromeo Castle dwindled behind
them, Orik said, “Can you hear my thoughts, Eragon?”
“Do you want me to try? I haven’t, you know.”
“Try.”
Frowning, Eragon concentrated his attention on the dwarf’s conscious-ness and was surprised to find
Orik’s mind well protected behind thick mental barriers. He could sense Orik’s presence, but not his
thoughts and feelings. “Nothing.”
Orik grinned. “Good. I wanted to make sure I hadn’t forgotten my old lessons.”
By unspoken consent, they did not stop for the night, but rather forged onward through the blackened
sky. Of the moon and stars they saw no sign, no flash or pale gleam to breach the oppressive gloom. The
dead hours bloated and sagged and, it seemed to Eragon, clung to each second as if reluctant to
surrender to the past.
When the sun finally returned—bringing with it its welcome light— Saphira landed by the edge of a small
lake so Eragon and Orik could stretch their legs, relieve themselves, and eat breakfast without the
con-stant movement they experienced on her back.

They had just taken off again when a long, low brown cloud appeared on the edge of the horizon, like a
smudge of walnut ink on a sheet of white paper. The cloud grew wider and wider as Saphira approached
it, until by late morning it obscured the entire land beneath a pall of foul
vapors.They had reached the Burning Plains of Alagaësia.
THE BURNING PLAINS

Eragon coughed as Saphira descended through the layers of smoke, an-gling toward the Jiet River,
which was hidden behind the haze. He blinked and wiped back tears. The fumes made his eyes smart.
Closer to the ground, the air cleared, giving Eragon an unobstructed view of their destination. The
rippling veil of black and crimson smoke filtered the sun’s rays in such a way that everything below was
bathed in a lurid orange. Occasional rents in the besmirched sky allowed pale bars of light to strike the
ground, where they remained, like pillars of translu-cent glass, until they were truncated by the shifting
clouds.
The Jiet River lay before them, as thick and turgid as a gorged snake, its crosshatched surface reflecting
the same ghastly hue that pervaded the Burning Plains. Even when a splotch of undiluted light happened
to fall upon the river, the water appeared chalky white, opaque and opales-cent—almost as if it were the
milk of some fearsome beast—and seemed to glow with an eerie luminescence all its own.
Two armies were arrayed along the eastern banks of the oozing water-way. To the south were the
Varden and the men of Surda, entrenched behind multiple layers of defense, where they displayed a fine
panoply of woven standards, ranks of proud tents, and the picketed horses of King Orrin’s cavalry.
Strong as they were, their numbers paled in comparison to the size of the force assembled in the north.
Galbatorix’s army was so large, it measured three miles across on its leading edge and how many in
length it was impossible to tell, for the individual men melded into a shadowy mass in the distance.
Between the mortal foes was an empty span of perhaps two miles. This land, and the land that the
armies camped on, was pocked with countless ragged orifices in which danced green tongues of fire.
From those sickly torches billowed plumes of smoke that dimmed the sun. Every scrap of vegetation had
been scorched from the parched soil, except for growths of black, orange, and chartreuse lichen that,
from the air, gave the earth a scabbed and infected appearance.
It was the most forbidding vista Eragon had clapped eyes upon.
Saphira emerged over the no-man’s-land that separated the grim armies, and now she twisted and dove
toward the Varden as fast as she dared, for so long as they remained exposed to the Empire, they were
vulnerable to attacks from enemy magicians. Eragon extended his awareness as far as he could in every
direction, hunting for hostile minds that could feel his probing touch and would react to it—the minds of
magicians and those trained to fend off magicians.
What he felt instead was the sudden panic that overwhelmed the Varden’s sentinels, many of whom, he
realized, had never before seen Saphira. Fear made them ignore their common sense, and they released a
flock of barbed arrows that arched up to intercept her.
Raising his right hand, Eragon cried, “Letta orya thorna!” The arrows froze in place. With a flick of his

Page 663

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

wrist and the word “Gánga,” he redi-rected them, sending the darts boring toward the no-man’s-land,
where they could bury themselves in the barren soil without causing harm. He missed one arrow, though,
which was fired a few seconds after the first volley.
Eragon leaned as far to his right as he could and, faster than any normal human, plucked the arrow from
the air as Saphira flew past it.
Only a hundred feet above the ground, Saphira flared her wings to slow her steep descent before
alighting first on her hind legs and then her front legs as she came to a running stop among the Varden’s
tents.
“Werg,” growled Orik, loosening the thongs that held his legs in place. “I’d rather fight a dozen Kull than
experience such a fall again.” He let himself hang off one side of the saddle, then dropped to Saphira’s
foreleg below and, from there, to the ground.
Even as Eragon dismounted, dozens of warriors with awestruck expres-sions gathered around Saphira.
From within their midst strode a big bear of a man whom Eragon recognized: Fredric, the Varden’s
weapon master from Farthen Dûr, still garbed in his hairy ox-hide armor. “Come on, you slack-jawed
louts!” roared Fredric. “Don’t stand here gawking; get back to your posts or I’ll have the lot of you
chalked up for extra watches!” At his command, the men began to disperse with many a grumbled word
and backward glance. Then Fredric drew nearer and, Eragon could tell, was startled by the change in
Eragon’s countenance. The bearded man did his best to conceal the reaction by touching his brow and
saying, “Wel-come, Shadeslayer. You’ve arrived just in time.... I can’t tell you how ashamed I am you
were attacked. The honor of every man here has been blackened by this mistake. Were the three of you
hurt?”
“No.”
Relief spread across Fredric’s face. “Well, there’s that to be grateful for. I’ve had the men responsible
pulled from duty. They’ll each be whipped and reduced in rank.... Will that punishment satisfy you,
Rider?”
“I want to see them,” said Eragon.
Sudden concern emanated from Fredric; it was obvious he feared that Eragon wanted to enact some
terrible and unnatural retribution on the sentinels. Fredric did not voice his concern, however, but said, “If
you’d follow me, then, sir.”
He led them through the camp to a striped command tent where twenty or so miserable-looking men
were divesting themselves of their arms and armor under the watchful eye of a dozen guards. At the sight
of Eragon and Saphira, the prisoners all went down on one knee and re-mained there, gazing at the
ground. “Hail, Shadeslayer!” they cried.
Eragon said nothing, but walked along the line of men while he studied their minds, his boots sinking
through the crust of the baked earth with an ominous crunch. At last he said, “You should be proud that
you re-acted so quickly to our appearance. If Galbatorix attacks, that’s exactly what you should do,
though I doubt arrows would prove any more effec-tive against him than they were against Saphira and
me.” The sentinels glanced at him with disbelief, their upturned faces tinted the color of tarnished brass by
the variegated light. “I only ask that, in the future, you take a moment to identify your target before
shooting. Next time I might be too distracted to stop your missiles. Am I understood?”

Page 664

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“Yes, Shadeslayer!” they shouted.
Stopping before the second-to-last man in the line, Eragon held out the arrow he had snared from
Saphira’s back. “I believe this is yours, Harwin.”
With an expression of wonder, Harwin accepted the arrow from Er-agon. “So it is! It has the white
band I always paint on my shafts so I can find them later. Thank you, Shadeslayer.”
Eragon nodded and then said to Fredric so all could hear, “These are good and true men, and I want no
misfortune to befall them because of this event.”
“I will see to it personally,” said Fredric, and smiled.
“Now, can you take us to Lady Nasuada?”
“Yes, sir.”
As he left the sentinels, Eragon knew that his kindness had earned him their undying loyalty, and that
tidings of his deed would spread through-out the Varden.
The path Fredric took through the tents brought Eragon into close con-tact with more minds than he had
ever touched before. Hundreds of thoughts, images, and sensations pressed against his consciousness.
De-spite his effort to keep them at a distance, he could not help absorbing random details of people’s
lives. Some revelations he found shocking, some meaningless, others touching or, conversely, disgusting,
and many embarrassing. A few people perceived the world so differently, their minds leaped out at him
on account of that very difference.
How easy it is to view these men as nothing more than objects that I and a few others can manipulate at
will. Yet they each possess hopes and dreams, potential for what they might achieve and memories of
what they have al-ready accomplished. And they all feel pain.
A handful of the minds he touched were aware of the contact and re-coiled from it, hiding their inner life
behind defenses of varying strength. At first Eragon was concerned—imagining that he had discovered a
great many enemies who had infiltrated the Varden—but then he realized from his quick glimpse that they
were the individual members of Du Vrangr Gata.
Saphira said, They must be scared out of their wits, thinking that they’re about to be assaulted by
some strange magician.
I can’t convince them otherwise while they block me like this.
You should meet them in person, and soon too, before they decide to band together and attack.
Aye, although I don’t think they pose a threat to us.... Du Vrangr Gata— their very name betrays their
ignorance. Properly, in the ancient language, it should be Du Gata Vrangr.
Their trip ended near the back of the Varden, at a large red pavilion flying a pennant embroidered with a
black shield and two parallel swords slanting underneath. Fredric pulled back the flap and Eragon and
Orik entered the pavilion. Behind them, Saphira pushed her head through the opening and peered over
their shoulders.

A broad table occupied the center of the furnished tent. Nasuada stood at one end, leaning on her
hands, studying a slew of maps and scrolls. Er-agon’s stomach clenched as he saw Arya opposite her.
Both women were armored as men for battle.
Nasuada turned her almond-shaped face toward him. “Eragon?” she whispered.
He was unprepared for how glad he was to see her. With a broad grin, he twisted his hand over his
sternum in the elves’ gesture of fealty and bowed. “At your service.”
“Eragon!” This time Nasuada sounded delighted and relieved. Arya, too, appeared pleased. “How did
you get our message so quickly?”
“I didn’t; I learned about Galbatorix’s army from my scrying and left Ellesméra the same day.” He
smiled at her again. “It’s good to be back with the Varden.”
While he spoke, Nasuada studied him with a wondering expression. “What has happened to you,
Eragon?”
Arya must not have told her,said Saphira.
And so Eragon gave a full account of what had befallen Saphira and him since they left Nasuada in
Farthen Dûr so long ago. Much of what he said, he sensed that she had already heard, either from the
dwarves or from Arya, but she let him speak without interrupting. Eragon had to be circumspect about
his training. He had given his word not to reveal Oromis’s existence without permission, and most of his
lessons were not to be shared with outsiders, but he did his best to give Nasuada a good idea of his skills
and their attendant risks. Of the Agaetí Blödhren, he merely said, “... and during the celebration, the
dragons worked upon me the change you see, giving me the physical abilities of an elf and healing my
back.”
“Your scar is gone, then?” asked Nasuada. He nodded. A few more sen-tences served to end his
narrative, briefly mentioning the reason they had left Du Weldenvarden and then summarizing their
journey thence. She shook her head. “What a tale. You and Saphira have experienced so much since
you left Farthen Dûr.”
“As have you.” He gestured at the tent. “It’s amazing what you’ve ac-complished. It must have taken an
enormous amount of work to get the Varden to Surda.... Has the Council of Elders caused you much
trouble?”
“A bit, but nothing extraordinary. They seem to have resigned them-selves to my leadership.” Her mail
clinking together, Nasuada seated her-self in a large, high-backed chair and turned to Orik, who had yet
to speak. She welcomed him and asked if he had aught to add to Eragon’s tale. Orik shrugged and
provided a few anecdotes from their stay in Ellesméra, though Eragon suspected that the dwarf kept his
true observa-tions a secret for his king.
When he finished, Nasuada said, “I am heartened to know that if we can weather this onslaught, we shall
have the elves by our side. Did any of you happen to see Hrothgar’s warriors during your flight from
Aberon? We are counting on their reinforcements.”
No,answered Saphira through Eragon. But then, it was dark and I was often above or between
clouds. I could have easily missed a camp under those conditions. In any case, I doubt we would
have crossed paths, for I flew straight from Aberon, and it seems likely the dwarves would choose

Page 666

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

a different route—perhaps following established roads—rather than march through the
wilderness.
“What,” asked Eragon, “is the situation here?”
Nasuada sighed and then told of how she and Orrin had learned about Galbatorix’s army and the
desperate measures they had resorted to since in order to reach the Burning Plains before the king’s
soldiers. She fin-ished by saying, “The Empire arrived three days ago. Since then, we’ve exchanged two
messages. First they asked for our surrender, which we refused, and now we wait for their reply.”
“How many of them are there?” growled Orik. “It looked a mighty number from Saphira’s back.”
“Aye. We estimate Galbatorix mustered as many as a hundred thou-sand soldiers.”
Eragon could not contain himself: “A hundred thousand! Where did they come from? It seems
impossible that he could find more than a handful of people willing to serve him.”
“They were conscripted. We can only hope that the men who were torn from their homes won’t be
eager to fight. If we can frighten them badly enough, they may break ranks and flee. Our numbers are
greater than in Farthen Dûr, for King Orrin has joined forces with us and we have received a veritable
flood of volunteers since we began to spread the word about you, Eragon, although we are still far
weaker than the Em-pire.”
Then Saphira asked, and Eragon was forced to repeat the dreadful ques-tion: What do you think our
chances of victory are?
“That,” said Nasuada, putting emphasis on the word, “depends a great deal upon you and Eragon, and
the number of magicians seeded through-out their troops. If you can find and destroy those magicians,
then our enemies shall be left unprotected and you can slay them at will. Outright victory, I think, is
unlikely at this point, but we might be able to hold them at bay until their supplies run low or until Islanzadí
can come to our assistance. That is... if Galbatorix doesn’t fly into battle himself. In that case, I fear
retreat will be our only option.”
Just then, Eragon felt a strange mind approaching, one that knew he was watching and yet did not shrink
from the contact. One that felt cold and hard, calculating. Alert for danger, Eragon turned his gaze
toward the rear of the pavilion, where he saw the same black-haired girl who had appeared when he
scryed Nasuada from Ellesméra. The girl stared at him with violet eyes, then said, “Welcome,
Shadeslayer. Welcome, Saphira.”
Eragon shivered at the sound of her voice, the voice of an adult. He wet his dry mouth and asked, “Who
are you?”
Without answering, the girl brushed back her glossy bangs and exposed a silvery white mark on her
forehead, exactly like Eragon’s gedwëy igna-sia. He knew then whom he faced.
No one moved as Eragon went to the girl, accompanied by Saphira, who extended her neck farther into
the pavilion. Dropping to one knee, Eragon took the girl’s right hand in his own; her skin burned as if with
fever. She did not resist him, but merely left her hand limp in his grip. In the ancient language—and also
with his mind, so that she would under-stand—Eragon said, “I am sorry. Can you forgive me for what I
did to you?”

Page 667

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

The girl’s eyes softened, and she leaned forward and kissed Eragon upon the brow. “I forgive you,” she
whispered, for the first time sounding her age. “How could I not? You and Saphira created who I am,
and I know you meant no harm. I forgive you, but I shall let this knowledge torture your conscience: You
have condemned me to be aware of all the suffer-ing around me. Even now your spell drives me to rush
to the aid of a man not three tents away who just cut his hand, to help the young flag carrier who broke
his left index finger in the spokes of a wagon wheel, and to help countless others who have been or are
about to be hurt. It costs me dearly to resist those urges, and even more if I consciously cause someone
discomfort, as I do by saying this.... I cannot even sleep at night for the strength of my compulsion. That
is your legacy, O Rider.” By the end, her voice had regained its bitter, mocking edge.
Saphira interposed herself between them and, with her snout, touched the girl in the center of her mark.
Peace, Changeling. You have much an-ger in your heart.
“You don’t have to live like this forever,” said Eragon. “The elves taught me how to undo a spell, and I
believe I can free you of this curse. It won’t be easy, but it can be done.”
For a moment, the girl seemed to lose her formidable self-control. A small gasp escaped her lips, her
hand trembled against Eragon’s, and her eyes glistened with a film of tears. Then just as quickly, she hid
her true emotions behind a mask of cynical amusement. “Well, we shall see. Ei-ther way, you shouldn’t
try until after this battle.”
“I could save you a great deal of pain.”
“It wouldn’t do to exhaust you when our survival may depend on your talents. I do not deceive myself;
you are more important than me.” A sly grin crossed her face. “Besides, if you remove your spell now, I
won’t be able to help any of the Varden if they are threatened. You wouldn’t want Nasuada to die
because of that, would you?”
“No,” admitted Eragon. He paused for a long time, considering the is-sue, then said, “Very well, I will
wait. But I swear to you: If we win this fight, I shall right this wrong.”
The girl tilted her head to one side. “I will hold you to your word, Rider.”
Rising from her chair, Nasuada said, “Elva was the one who saved me from an assassin in Aberon.”
“Did she? In that case, I am in your debt... Elva... for protecting my liegelord.”
“Come now,” said Nasuada. “I must introduce the three of you to Orrin and his nobles. Have you met
the king before, Orik?”
The dwarf shook his head. “I’ve never been this far west.”
As they left the pavilion—Nasuada in the lead, with Elva by her side— Eragon tried to position himself
so he could talk with Arya, but when he neared her, she quickened her pace until she was level with
Nasuada. Arya never even looked at him while she walked, a slight that caused him more anguish than
any physical wound he had endured. Elva glanced back at him, and he knew that she was aware of his
distress.
They soon arrived at another large pavilion, this one white and yel-low—although it was difficult to
determine the exact hue of the colors, given the garish orange that glazed everything on the Burning
Plains. Once they were granted entrance, Eragon was astonished to find the tent crammed with an

Page 668

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

eccentric collection of beakers, alembics, retorts, and other instruments of natural philosophy. Who
would bother toting all this onto a battlefield? he wondered, bewildered.
“Eragon,” said Nasuada, “I would like you to meet Orrin, son of Larkin and monarch of the realm of
Surda.”
From the depths of the tangled piles of glass emerged a rather tall, handsome man with shoulder-length
hair held back by the gold coronet resting upon his head. His mind, like Nasuada’s, was protected
behind walls of iron; it was obvious he had received extensive training in that skill. Orrin seemed pleasant
enough to Eragon from their discussion, if a bit green and untried when it came to commanding men in
war and more than a little odd in the head. On the whole, Eragon trusted Nasuada’s leadership more.
After fending off scores of questions from Orrin about his stay among the elves, Eragon found himself
smiling and nodding politely as one earl after another paraded past, each of whom insisted on shaking his
hand, telling him what an honor it was to meet a Rider, and inviting him to their respective estates. Eragon
dutifully memorized their many names and titles—as he knew Oromis would expect—and did his best to
main-tain a calm demeanor, despite his growing frustration.
We’re about to engage one of the largest armies in history, and here we are, stuck exchanging
pleasantries.
Patience,counseled Saphira. There aren’t that many more.... Besides, look at it this way: if we win,
they’ll owe us an entire year of free dinners, what with all their promises.
He stifled a chuckle. I think it would dismay them to know what it takes to feed you. Not to
mention that you could empty their cellars of beer and wine in a single night.
I would never,she sniffed, then relented. Maybe in two nights.
When at last they won free of Orrin’s pavilion, Eragon asked Nasuada, “What shall I do now? How can
I serve you?”
Nasuada eyed him with a curious expression. “How do you think you can best serve me, Eragon? You
know your own abilities far better than I do.” Even Arya watched him now, waiting to hear his response.
Eragon gazed up at the bloody sky while he pondered her question. “I shall take control of Du Vrangr
Gata, as they once asked me to, and or-ganize them underneath me so I can lead them into battle.
Working to-gether will give us the best chance of foiling Galbatorix’s magicians.”
“That seems an excellent idea.”
Is there a place,asked Saphira, where Eragon can leave his bags? I don’t want to carry them or
this saddle any longer than I have to.
When Eragon repeated her question, Nasuada said, “Of course. You may leave them in my pavilion,
and I will arrange to have a tent erected for you, Eragon, where you can keep them permanently. I
suggest, though, that you don your armor before parting with your bags. You might need it at any
moment.... That reminds me: we have your armor with us, Saphira. I shall have it unpacked and brought
to you.”
“And what of me, Lady?” asked Orik.

“We have several knurlan with us from Dûrgrimst Ingeitum who have lent their expertise to the
construction of our earthen defenses. You may take command of them if you wish.”
Orik seemed heartened by the prospect of seeing fellow dwarves, espe-cially ones from his own clan.
He clapped his fist to his chest and said, “I think I will at that. If you’ll excuse me, I’ll see to it at once.”
Without a backward glance, he trundled off through the camp, heading north to-ward the breastwork.
Returning to her pavilion with the four who remained, Nasuada said to Eragon, “Report to me once you
have settled matters with Du Vrangr Gata.” Then she pushed aside the entrance flap to the pavilion and
disap-peared with Elva through the dark opening.
As Arya started to follow, Eragon reached toward her and, in the an-cient language, said, “Wait.” The
elf paused and looked at him, betraying nothing. He held her gaze without wavering, staring deep into her
eyes, which reflected the strange light around them. “Arya, I won’t apologize for how I feel about you.
However, I wanted you to know that I amsorry for how I acted during the Blood-oath Celebration. I
wasn’t myself that night; otherwise, I would have never been so forward with you.”
“And you won’t do it again?”
He suppressed a humorless laugh. “It wouldn’t get me anywhere if I did, now would it?” When she
remained silent, he said, “No matter. I don’t want to trouble you, even if you—” He bit off the end of his
sen-tence before he made a remark he knew he would regret.
Arya’s expression softened. “I’m not trying to hurt you, Eragon. You must understand that.”
“I understand,” he said, but without conviction.
An awkward pause stretched between them. “Your flight went well, I trust?”
“Well enough.”
“You encountered no difficulty in the desert?”
“Should we have?”
“No. I only wondered.” Then, in an even gentler voice, Arya asked, “What of you, Eragon? How have
you been since the celebration? I heard what you said to Nasuada, but you mentioned nothing other than
your back.”
“I...” He tried to lie—not wanting her to know how much he had missed her—but the ancient language
stopped the words dead in his mouth and rendered him mute. Finally, he resorted to a technique of the
elves: telling only part of the truth in order to create an impression oppo-site the whole truth. “I’m better
than before,” he said, meaning, in his mind, the condition of his back.
Despite his subterfuge, Arya appeared unconvinced. She did not press him on the subject, though, but
rather said, “I am glad.” Nasuada’s voice emanated from inside the pavilion, and Arya glanced toward it
before facing him again. “I am needed elsewhere, Eragon.... We are both needed elsewhere. A battle is
about to take place.” Lifting the canvas flap, she stepped halfway into the gloomy tent, then hesitated and
added, “Take care, Eragon Shadeslayer.”

Then she was gone.
Dismay rooted Eragon in place. He had accomplished what he wanted to, but it seemed to have
changed nothing between him and Arya. He balled his hands into fists and hunched his shoulders and
glared at the ground without seeing it, simmering with frustration.
He started when Saphira nosed him on the shoulder. Come on, little one, she said gently. You can’t
stay here forever, and this saddle is begin-ning to itch .
Going to her side, Eragon pulled on her neck strap, muttering under his breath when it caught in the
buckle. He almost hoped the leather would break. Undoing the rest of the straps, he let the saddle and
everything tied to it fall to the ground in a jumbled heap. It feels good to have that off, said Saphira,
rolling her massive shoulders.
Digging his armor out of the saddlebags, Eragon outfitted himself in the bright dress of war. First he
pulled his hauberk over his elven tunic, then strapped his chased greaves to his legs and his inlaid bracers
to his fore-arms. On his head went his padded leather cap, followed by his coif of tempered steel and
then his gold and silver helm. Last of all, he replaced his regular gloves with his mail-backed gauntlets.
Zar’roc he hung on his left hip using the belt of Beloth the Wise. Across his back, he placed the quiver of
white swan feathers Islanzadí had given him. The quiver, he was pleased to find, could also hold the bow
the elf queen had sung for him, even when it was strung.
After depositing his and Orik’s belongings into the pavilion, Eragon and Saphira set out together to find
Trianna, the current leader of Du Vrangr Gata. They had gone no more than a few paces when Eragon
sensed a nearby mind that was shielded from his view. Assuming that it was one of the Varden’s
magicians, they veered toward it.
Twelve yards from their starting point, they came upon a small green tent with a donkey picketed in
front. To the left of the tent, a blackened iron cauldron hung from a metal tripod placed over one of the
malodor-ous flames birthed deep within the earth. Cords were strung about the cauldron, over which
were draped nightshade, hemlock, rhododendron, savin, bark of the yew tree, and numerous
mushrooms, such as death cap and spotted cort, all of which Eragon recognized from Oromis’s lessons
on poison. And standing next to the cauldron, wielding a long wood pad-dle with which she stirred the
brew, was Angela the herbalist. At her feet sat Solembum.
The werecat uttered a mournful meow, and Angela looked up from her task, her corkscrew hair forming
a billowing thundercloud around her glistening face. She frowned, and her expression became positively
ghoul-ish, for it was lit from beneath by the flickering green flame. “So you’ve returned, eh!”
“We have,” said Eragon.
“Is that all you have to say for yourself? Have you seen Elva yet? Have you seen what you did to that
poor girl?”
“Aye.”
“Aye!”cried Angela. “How inarticulate can a person be? All this time in Ellesméra being tutored by the
elves, and aye is the best you can manage? Let me tell you something, blockhead: anyone who is stupid
enough to do what you did deserves—”

Page 671

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Eragon clasped his hands behind his back and waited as Angela in-formed him, in many explicit,
detailed, and highly inventive terms, ex-actly how great a blockhead he was; what kind of ancestors he
must pos-sess to be such a monumental blockhead—she even went so far as to in-sinuate that one of his
grandparents had mated with an Urgal—and the quite hideous punishments he ought to receive for his
idiocy. If anyone else had insulted him in that manner, Eragon would have challenged them to a duel, but
he tolerated her spleen because he knew he could not judge her behavior by the same standards as he
did others, and be-cause he knew her outrage was justified; he had made a dreadful mistake.
When she finally paused for breath, he said, “You’re quite right, and I’m going to try to remove the spell
once the battle is decided.”
Angela blinked three times, one right after the other, and her mouth remained open for a moment in a
small “O” before she clamped it shut. With a glare of suspicion, she asked, “You’re not saying that just to
pla-cate me, are you?”
“I would never.”
“And you really intend to undo your curse? I thought such things were irrevocable.”
“The elves have discovered many uses of magic.”
“Ah... Well, then, that’s settled, isn’t it?” She flashed him a wide smile and then strode past him to pat
Saphira on her jowls. “It’s good to see you again, Saphira. You’ve grown.”
Well met indeed, Angela.
As Angela returned to stirring her concoction, Eragon said, “That was an impressive tirade you gave.”
“Thank you. I worked on it for several weeks. It’s a pity you didn’t get to hear the ending; it’s
memorable. I could finish it for you if you want.”
“No, that’s all right. I can imagine what it’s like.” Glancing at her out of the corner of his eye, Eragon
then said, “You don’t seem surprised by how I’ve changed.”
The herbalist shrugged. “I have my sources. It’s an improvement, in my opinion. You were a bit... oh,
how shall I say it?... unfinishedbefore.”
“That I was.” He gestured at the hanging plants. “What do you plan to do with these?”
“Oh, it’s just a little project of mine—an experiment, if you will.”
“Mmm.” Examining the pattern of colors on a dried mushroom that dangled before him, Eragon asked,
“Did you ever figure out if toads exist or not?”
“As a matter of fact, I did! It seems that all toads are frogs, but not all frogs are toads. So in that sense,
toads don’t really exist, which means that I was right all along.” She stopped her patter abruptly, leaned
to the side, grabbed a mug from a bench next to her, and offered it to Eragon. “Here, have a cup of tea.”
Eragon glanced at the deadly plants surrounding them and then back at Angela’s open face before he
accepted the mug. Under his breath—so the herbalist would not hear—he muttered three spells to detect
poison. Only once he ascertained that the tea was free of contamination did he dare drink. The tea was

Page 672

delicious, though he could not identify the ingre-dients.
At that moment, Solembum padded over to Saphira and began to arch his back and rub himself up
against her leg, just as any normal cat would. Twisting her neck, Saphira bent down and with the tip of
her nose brushed the werecat the length of his spine. She said, I met someone in Ellesméra who knows
you.
Solembum stopped rubbing and cocked his head. Is that so?
Yes. Her name was Quickpaw and The Dream Dancer and also Maud.
Solembum’s golden eyes widened. A deep, throaty purr rumbled in his chest, and he rubbed against
Saphira with renewed vigor.
“So,” said Angela, “I assume you already spoke with Nasuada, Arya, and King Orrin.” He nodded.
“And what did you think of dear old Orrin?”
Eragon chose his words with care, for he was aware that they were talk-ing about a king. “Well... he
seems to have a great many interests.”
“Yes, he’s as balmy as a moonstruck fool on Midsummer Night Eve. But then everyone is, in one way
or another.”
Amused by her forthrightness, Eragon said, “He must be crazy to have carted so much glass all the way
from Aberon.”
Angela raised an eyebrow. “What’s this now?”
“Haven’t you seen the inside of his tent?”
“Unlike some people,” she sniffed, “I don’t ingratiate myself with every monarch I meet.” So he
described for her the mass of instruments Orrin had brought to the Burning Plains. Angela abandoned her
stirring as he spoke and listened with great interest. The instant he finished, she began bustling around the
cauldron, gathering the plants off the lines—often us-ing tongs to do so—and saying, “I think I had best
pay Orrin a visit. The two of you will have to tell me about your trip to Ellesméra at a later time.... Well,
go on, both of you. Be gone!”
Eragon shook his head as the short little woman drove him and Saphira away from her tent, and he still
holding the cup of tea. Talking with her is always...
Different?suggested Saphira.
Exactly.
THE CLOUDS OF WAR

From there it took them almost half an hour to locate Trianna’s tent, which apparently served as the
unofficial headquarters of Du Vrangr Gata. They had difficulty finding the tent because few people knew
of its existence, and even fewer could tell them where it lay because the tent was hidden behind a spur of

Page 673

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

rock that served to conceal it from the gaze of enemy magicians in Galbatorix’s army.
As Eragon and Saphira approached the black tent, the entrance was thrust open and Trianna strode out,
her arms bare to the elbow in prepa-ration to use magic. Behind her clustered a group of determined if
fright-ened-looking spellcasters, many of whom Eragon had seen during the bat-tle in Farthen Dûr, either
fighting or healing the wounded.
Eragon watched as Trianna and the others reacted with the now-expected surprise at his altered
appearance. Lowering her arms, Trianna said, “Shadeslayer, Saphira. You should have told us sooner
that you were here. We’ve been preparing to confront and battle what we thought was a mighty foe.”
“I didn’t mean to upset you,” said Eragon, “but we had to report to Nasuada and King Orrin
immediately after we landed.”
“And why have you graced us with your presence now? You never deigned to visit us before, we who
are more your brethren than any in the Varden.”
“I have come to take command of Du Vrangr Gata.” The assembled spellcasters muttered with surprise
at his announcement, and Trianna stiffened. Eragon felt several magicians probe his consciousness in an
at-tempt to divine his true intentions. Instead of guarding himself—which would blind him to impending
attacks—Eragon retaliated by jabbing the minds of the would-be invaders hard enough that they
retreated behind their own barriers. As he did, Eragon had the satisfaction of seeing two men and a
woman flinch and avert their gazes.
“By whose order?” demanded Trianna.
“By Nasuada’s.”
“Ah,” said the sorceress with a triumphant smile, “but Nasuada has no direct authority over us. We help
the Varden of our own free will.”
Her resistance puzzled Eragon. “I’m sure Nasuada would be surprised to hear that, after everything she,
and her father, have done for Du Vrangr Gata. It might give her the impression that you no longer wanted
the support and protection of the Varden.” He let the threat hang in the air for a moment. “Besides, I
seem to remember you were willing to give me this post before. Why not now?”
Trianna lifted an eyebrow. “You refused my offer, Shadeslayer... or have you forgotten?” Composed as
she was, a trace of defensiveness colored her response, and Eragon suspected she knew her position
was untenable. She seemed more mature to him than when they last met, and he had to remind himself of
the hardships she must have endured since: marching across Alagaësia to Surda, supervising the
magicians of Du Vrangr Gata, and preparing for war.
“We could not accept then. It was the wrong time.”
Abruptly changing tack, she asked, “Why does Nasuada believe you should command us anyway?
Surely you and Saphira would be more use-ful elsewhere.”
“Nasuada wants me to lead you, Du Vrangr Gata, in the coming battle, and so I shall.” Eragon thought it
best not to mention that it was his idea.
A dark scowl gave Trianna a fierce appearance. She pointed at the clus-ter of spellcasters behind her.

Page 674

“We have devoted our lives to the study of our art. You have been casting spells for less than two years.
What makes you more qualified for this task than any of us?... No matter. Tell me: What is your strategy?
How do you plan to employ us?”
“My plan is simple,” he said. “The lot of you will join minds and search for enemy spellcasters. When
you find one, I’ll add my strength to yours, and together we can crush the spellcaster’s resistance. Then
we can slay the troops that previously were protected by his or her wards.”
“And what will you be doing the rest of the time?”
“Fighting alongside Saphira.”
After an awkward silence, one of the men behind Trianna said, “It’s a good plan.” He quailed as Trianna
cast an angry glare at him.
She slowly faced Eragon again. “Ever since the Twins died, I have led Du Vrangr Gata. Under my
guidance, they have provided the means to fund the Varden’s war effort, ferreted out the Black
Hand—Galbatorix’s network of spies that tried to assassinate Nasuada—as well as performing
innumerable other services. I do not boast when I say these are no mean accomplishments. And I’m
certain I can continue to produce such re-sults.... Why, then, does Nasuada want to depose me? How
have I dis-pleased her?”
Everything became clear to Eragon, then. She has grown accustomed to power and doesn’t want to
surrender it. But more than that, she thinks that my replacing her is a criticism of her leadership .
You need to resolve this debate, and quickly too,said Saphira. Our time grows short .
Eragon racked his brain for a way to establish his authority in Du Vrangr Gata without further alienating
Trianna. At last he said, “I didn’t come here to stir up trouble. I came to ask for your help.” He spoke to
the entire congregation but looked only at the sorceress. “I am strong, yes. Saphira and I could probably
defeat any number of Galbatorix’s pet ma-gicians. But we cannot protect everyone in the Varden. We
cannot be everywhere. And if the Empire’s battle-mages join forces against us, then even we will be
hard-pressed to survive.... We cannot fight this battle alone. You are quite right, Trianna—you have done
well with Du Vrangr Gata, and I’m not here to usurp your authority. It’s only that—as a magi-cian—I
need to work with Du Vrangr Gata, and—as a Rider—I may also need to give you orders, orders that I
have to know will be obeyed with-out question. The chain of command must be established. That said,
you will retain the greater part of your autonomy. Most times I’ll be too busy to devote my attention to
Du Vrangr Gata. Nor do I intend to ignore your counsel, for I’m aware that you have far more
experience than I.... So I ask again, will you help us, for the good of the Varden?”
Trianna paused, then bowed. “Of course, Shadeslayer—for the good of the Varden. It will be an honor
to have you lead Du Vrangr Gata.”
“Then let us begin.”
Over the next few hours, Eragon talked with every one of the assem-bled magicians, although a fair
number were absent, being occupied with one task or another to help the Varden. He did his best to
acquaint him-self with their knowledge of magic. He learned that the majority of men and women in Du
Vrangr Gata had been introduced to their craft by a relative, and usually in profound secrecy to avoid
attracting attention from those who feared magic—and, of course, Galbatorix himself. Only a handful had
received proper apprenticeships. As a result, most of the spellcasters knew little about the ancient

Page 675

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

language—none could truly speak it fluently—their beliefs about magic were often distorted by reli-gious
superstitions, and they were ignorant of numerous applications of gramarye.
No wonder the Twins were so desperate to extract your vocabulary of the ancient language when they
tested you in Farthen Dûr,observed Saphira. With it they could have easily conquered these lesser
magicians.
They’re all we have to work with, though.
True. I hope you can see now I was right about Trianna. She places her own desires before the good of
the many.
You were right,he agreed. But I don’t condemn her for it. Trianna deals with the world in the best
way she can, as do we all. I understand that, even if I don’t approve, and understanding—as
Oromis said—breeds empa-thy.
A bit more than a third of the spellcasters specialized as healers. Those Eragon sent on their way after
giving them a quintet of new spells to memorize, enchantments that would allow them to treat a greater
range of injuries. The remaining spellcasters Eragon worked with to establish a clear chain of
command—he appointed Trianna his lieutenant and let her ensure that his orders were carried out—and
to weld their disparate per-sonalities into a cohesive fighting unit. Trying to convince magicians to
cooperate, he discovered, was like trying to get a pack of dogs to share a meat bone. Nor did it help that
they were in evident awe of him, for he could find no way of using his influence to smooth relations
among the contentious magicians.
In order to gain a better idea of their exact proficiency, Eragon had them cast a series of spells. As he
watched them struggle with enchant-ments that he now considered simple, Eragon became aware of just
how far his own powers had advanced. To Saphira, he marveled, And to think I once had trouble
lifting a pebble in the air.
And to think,she replied, Galbatorix has had over a century to hone his talent.
The sun was low in the west, intensifying the fermented orange light until the Varden’s camp, the livid Jiet
River, and the entirety of the Burning Plains glowed in the mad, marbled effulgence, as if in a scene from
a lunatic’s dreams. The sun was no more than a finger’s breadth above the horizon when a runner arrived
at the tent. He told Eragon that Nasuada ordered him to attend her at once. “An’ I think you’d better
hurry, Shadeslayer, if you don’t mind me saying so.”
After extracting a promise from Du Vrangr Gata that they would be ready and willing when he called
upon them for assistance, Eragon ran alongside Saphira through the rows of gray tents toward Nasuada’s
pavil-ion. A harsh tumult above them caused Eragon to lift his eyes from the treacherous ground long
enough to glance overhead.
What he saw was a giant flock of birds wheeling between the two ar-mies. He spotted eagles, hawks,
and falcons, along with countless greedy crows and their larger, dagger-beaked, blue-backed, rapacious
cousin, the raven. Each bird shrieked for blood to wet its throat and enough hot meat to fill its belly and
sate its hunger. By experience and instinct, they knew that whenever armies appeared in Alagaësia, they
could expect to feast on acres of carrion.
The clouds of war are gathering,observed Eragon.

NAR GARZHVOG

Eragon entered the pavilion, Saphira pushing her head through after him. He was met by a steely rasp as
Jörmundur and a half-dozen of Nasuada’s commanders drew their swords at the intruders. The men
lowered their weapons as Nasuada said, “Come here, Eragon.”
“What is your bidding?” Eragon asked.
“Our scouts report that a company of some hundred Kull approach from the northeast.”
Eragon frowned. He had not expected to encounter Urgals in this bat-tle, since Durza no longer
controlled them and so many had been killed in Farthen Dûr. But if they had come, they had come. He
felt his blood-lust rise and allowed himself a savage grin as he contemplated destroying Urgals with his
new strength. Clapping his hand to Zar’roc’s hilt, he said, “It will be a pleasure to eliminate them. Saphira
and I can handle it by ourselves, if you want.”
Nasuada watched his face carefully as she said, “We can’t do that, Er-agon. They’re flying a white flag,
and they have asked to talk with me.”
Eragon gaped at her. “Surely you don’t intend to grant them an audi-ence?”
“I will offer them the same courtesies I would to any foe who arrives under the banner of truce.”
“They’re brutes, though. Monsters! It’s folly to allow them into the camp.... Nasuada, I have seen the
atrocities Urgals commit. They relish pain and suffering and deserve no more mercy than a rabid dog.
There is no need for you to waste time over what is surely a trap. Just give the word and I and every last
one of your warriors will be more than willing to kill these foul creatures for you.”
“In this,” said Jörmundur, “I agree with Eragon. If you won’t listen to us, Nasuada, at least listen to him.”
First Nasuada said to Eragon in a murmur low enough that no one else could hear, “Your training is
indeed unfinished if you are so blinded.” Then she raised her voice, and in it Eragon heard the same
adamantine notes of command that her father had possessed: “You all forget that I fought in Farthen Dûr,
the same as you, and that I saw the savagery of the Urgals.... However, I also saw our own men commit
acts just as hei-nous. I shall not denigrate what we have endured at the Urgals’ hands, but neither shall I
ignore potential allies when we are so greatly outnum-bered by the Empire.”
“My Lady, it’s too dangerous for you to meet with a Kull.”
“Too dangerous?” Nasuada raised an eyebrow. “While I am protected by Eragon, Saphira, Elva, and all
the warriors around me? I think not.”
Eragon gritted his teeth with frustration. Say something, Saphira. You can convince her to abandon
this harebrained scheme.
No, I won’t. Your mind is clouded on this issue.
You can’t agree with her!exclaimed Eragon, aghast. You were there in Yazuac with me; you know
what the Urgals did to the villagers. And what about when we left Teirm, my capture at Gil’ead,

Page 677

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

and Farthen Dûr? Every time we’ve encountered Urgals, they’ve tried to kill us or worse. They’re
nothing more than vicious animals.
The elves believed the same thing about dragons during Du Fyrn Skulblaka.
At Nasuada’s behest, her guards tied back the front and side panels of the pavilion, leaving it open for
all to see and allowing Saphira to crouch low next to Eragon. Then Nasuada seated herself in her
high-backed chair, and Jörmundur and the other commanders arranged themselves in two parallel rows
so that anyone who sought an audience with her had to walk between them. Eragon stood at her right
hand, Elva by her left.
Less than five minutes later, a great roar of anger erupted from the eastern edge of the camp. The storm
of jeers and insults grew louder and louder until a single Kull entered their view, walking toward Nasuada
while a mob of the Varden peppered him with taunts. The Urgal—or ram, as Eragon remembered they
were called—held his head high and bared his yellow fangs, but did not otherwise react to the abuse
directed at him. He was a magnificent specimen, eight and a half feet tall, with strong, proud—if
grotesque—features, thick horns that spiraled all the way around, and a fantastic musculature that made it
seem he could kill a bear with a single blow. His only clothing was a knotted loincloth, a few plates of
crude iron armor held together with scraps of mail, and a curved metal disk nestled between his two
horns to protect the top of his head.
His long black hair was in a queue.
Eragon felt his lips tighten in a grimace of hate; he had to struggle to keep from drawing Zar’roc and
attacking. Yet despite himself, he could not help but admire the Urgal’s courage in confronting an entire
army of enemies alone and unarmed. To his surprise, he found the Kull’s mind strongly shielded.
When the Urgal stopped before the eaves of the pavilion, not daring to come any closer, Nasuada had
her guards shout for quiet to settle the crowd. Everyone looked at the Urgal, wondering what he would
do next.
The Urgal lifted his bulging arms toward the sky, inhaled a mighty breath, and then opened his maw and
bellowed at Nasuada. In an instant, a thicket of swords pointed at the Kull, but he paid them no attention
and continued his ululation until his lungs were empty. Then he looked at Nasuada, ignoring the hundreds
of people who, it was obvious, longed to kill him, and growled in a thick, guttural accent, “What
treachery is this, Lady Nightstalker? I was promised safe passage. Do humans break their word so
easily?”
Leaning toward her, one of Nasuada’s commanders said, “Let us punish him, Mistress, for his insolence.
Once we have taught him the meaning of respect, then you can hear his message, whatever it is.”
Eragon longed to remain silent, but he knew his duty to Nasuada and the Varden, so he bent down and
said in Nasuada’s ear, “Don’t take of-fense. This is how they greet their war chiefs. The proper response
is to then butt heads, but I don’t think you want to try that.”
“Did the elves teach you this?” she murmured, never taking her eyes off the waiting Kull.
“Aye.”
“What else did they teach you of the Urgals?”

Page 678

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“A great deal,” he admitted reluctantly.
Then Nasuada said to the Kull and also to her men beyond, “The Varden are not liars like Galbatorix
and the Empire. Speak your mind; you need fear no danger while we hold council under the conditions of
truce.”
The Urgal grunted and raised his bony chin higher, baring his throat; Eragon recognized it as a gesture of
friendship. To lower one’s head was a threat in their race, for it meant that an Urgal intended to ram you
with his horns. “I am Nar Garzhvog of the Bolvek tribe. I speak for my peo-ple.” It seemed as if he
chewed on each word before spitting it out. “Ur-gals are hated more than any other race. Elves,
dwarves, humans all hunt us, burn us, and drive us from our halls.”
“Not without good reason,” pointed out Nasuada.
Garzhvog nodded. “Not without reason. Our people love war. Yet how often are we attacked just
because you find us as ugly as we find you? We have thrived since the fall of the Riders. Our tribes are
now so large, the harsh land we live in can no longer feed us.”
“So you made a pact with Galbatorix.”
“Aye, Lady Nightstalker. He promised us good land if we killed his enemies. He tricked us, though. His
flame-haired shaman, Durza, bent the minds of our war chiefs and forced our tribes to work together, as
is not our way. When we learned this in the dwarves’ hollow mountain, the Herndall, the dams who rule
us, sent my brood mate to Galbatorix to ask why he used us so.” Garzhvog shook his ponderous head.
“She did not re-turn. Our finest rams died for Galbatorix, then he abandoned us like a broken sword. He
is drajl and snake-tongued and a lack-horned betrayer. Lady Nightstalker, we are fewer now, but we
will fight with you if you let us.”
“What is the price?” asked Nasuada. “Your Herndall must want some-thing in return.”
“Blood. Galbatorix’s blood. And if the Empire falls, we ask that you give us land, land for breeding and
growing, land to avoid more battles in the future.”
Eragon guessed Nasuada’s decision by the set of her face, even before she spoke. So apparently did
Jörmundur, for he leaned toward her and said in an undertone, “Nasuada, you can’t do this. It goes
against nature.”
“Nature can’t help us defeat the Empire. We need allies.”
“The men will desert before they’ll fight with Urgals.”
“That can be worked around. Eragon, will they keep their word?”
“Only so long as we share a common enemy.”
With a sharp nod, Nasuada again lifted her voice: “Very well, Nar Garzhvog. You and your warriors
may bivouac along the eastern flank of our army, away from the main body, and we shall discuss the
terms of our pact.”
“Ahgrat ukmar,” growled the Kull, clapping his fists to his brow. “You are a wise Herndall, Lady
Nightstalker.”

“Why do you call me that?”
“Herndall?”
“No, Nightstalker.”
Garzhvog made a ruk-ruk sound in his throat that Eragon interpreted as laughter. “Nightstalker is the
name we gave your sire because of how he hunted us in the dark tunnels under the dwarf mountain and
because of the color of his hide. As his cub, you are worthy of the same name.” With that he turned on
his heel and strode out of the camp.
Standing, Nasuada proclaimed, “Anyone who attacks the Urgals shall be punished as if he attacked a
fellow human. See that word of this is posted in every company.”
No sooner had she finished than Eragon noticed King Orrin approach-ing at a quick pace, his cape
flapping around him. When he was close enough, he cried, “Nasuada! Is it true you met with an Urgal?
What do you mean by it, and why wasn’t I alerted sooner? I don’t—”
He was interrupted as a sentry emerged from the ranks of gray tents, shouting, “A horseman approaches
from the Empire!”
In an instant, King Orrin forgot his argument and joined Nasuada as she hurried toward the vanguard of
the army, followed by at least a hundred people. Rather than stay among the crowd, Eragon pulled
himself onto Saphira and let her carry him to their destination.
When Saphira halted at the ramparts, trenches, and rows of sharpened poles that protected the
Varden’s leading edge, Eragon saw a lone soldier riding at a furious clip across the bleak no-man’s-land.
Above him, the birds of prey swooped low to discover if the first course of their feast had arrived.
The soldier reined in his black stallion some thirty yards from the breastwork, keeping as much distance
as possible between him and the Varden. He shouted, “By refusing King Galbatorix’s generous terms of
surrender, you choose death as your fate. No more shall we negotiate. The hand of friendship has turned
into the fist of war! If any of you still hold regard for your rightful sovereign, the all-knowing, all-powerful
King Galbatorix, then flee! None may stand before us once we set forth to cleanse Alagaësia of every
miscreant, traitor, and subversive. And though it pains our lord—for he knows that most of these
rebellious acts are instigated by bitter and misguided leaders—we shall gently chastise the unlawful
territory known as Surda and return it to the benevolent rule of King Galbatorix, he who sacrifices himself
day and night for the good of his people. So flee, I say, or suffer the doom of your herald.”
With that the soldier untied a canvas sack and flourished a severed head. He threw it into the air and
watched it fall among the Varden, then turned his stallion, dug in his spurs, and galloped back toward the
dark mass of Galbatorix’s army.
“Shall I kill him?” asked Eragon.
Nasuada shook her head. “We will have our due soon enough. I won’t violate the sanctity of envoys,
even if the Empire has.”
“As you—” He yelped with surprise and clutched Saphira’s neck to keep from falling as she reared
above the ramparts, planting her front legs upon the chartreuse bank. Opening her jaws, Saphira uttered

Page 680

a long, deep roar, much like Garzhvog had done, only this roar was a defiant challenge to their enemies, a
warning of the wrath they had roused, and a clarion call to all who hated Galbatorix.
The sound of her trumpeting voice frightened the stallion so badly, he jinked to the right, slipped on the
heated ground, and fell on his side. The soldier was thrown free of the horse and landed in a gout of fire
that erupted at that very instant. He uttered a single cry so horrible, it made Eragon’s scalp prickle, then
was silent and still forevermore.
The birds began to descend.
The Varden cheered Saphira’s accomplishment. Even Nasuada allowed herself a small smile. Then she
clapped her hands and said, “They will at-tack at dawn, I think. Eragon, gather Du Vrangr Gata and
prepare your-self for action. I will have orders for you within the hour.” Taking Orrin by the shoulder, she
guided him back toward the center of the com-pound, saying, “Sire, there are decisions we must make. I
have a certain plan, but it will require...”
Let them come,said Saphira. The tip of her tail twitched like that of a cat stalking a rabbit. They will all
burn.
WITCH’S BREW

Night had fallen on the Burning Plains. The roof of opaque smoke cov-ered the moon and stars, plunging
the land into profound darkness that was broken only by the sullen glow of the sporadic peat fires, and
by the thousands of torches each army lit. From Eragon’s position near the fore of the Varden, the
Empire looked a dense nest of uncertain orange lights as large as any city.
As Eragon buckled the last piece of Saphira’s armor onto her tail, he closed his eyes to maintain better
contact with the magicians from Du Vrangr Gata. He had to learn to locate them at a moment’s notice;
his life would depend on communicating with them in a quick and timely man-ner. In turn, the magicians
had to learn to recognize the touch of his mind so they did not block him when he needed their
assistance.
Eragon smiled and said, “Hello, Orik.” He opened his eyes to see Orik clambering up the low knuckle
of rock where he and Saphira sat. The dwarf, who was fully armored, carried his Urgal-horn bow in his
left hand.
Hunkering beside Eragon, Orik wiped his brow and shook his head. “How’d you know it was me? I
was shielding myself.”
Every consciousness feels different,explained Saphira. Just like no two voices sound exactly the
same.
“Ah.”
Eragon asked, “What brings you here?”
Orik shrugged. “It struck me you might appreciate a spot of company in this grim night. Especially since
Arya’s otherwise engaged and you don’t have Murtagh with you for this battle.”

Page 681

And I wish I did,thought Eragon. Murtagh had been the only human who matched Eragon’s skill with a
sword, at least before the Agaetí Blödhren. Sparring with him had been one of Eragon’s few pleasures
dur-ing their time together. I would have enjoyed fighting with you again, old friend.
Remembering how Murtagh was killed—dragged underground by Ur-gals in Farthen Dûr—forced
Eragon to confront a sobering truth: No matter how great a warrior you were, as often as not, pure
chance dictated who lived and who died in war.
Orik must have sensed his mood, for he clapped Eragon on the shoul-der and said, “You’ll be fine. Just
imagine how the soldiers out there feel, knowing they have to face you before long!”
Gratitude made Eragon smile again. “I’m glad you came.”
The tip of Orik’s nose reddened, and he glanced down, rolling his bow between gnarled hands. “Ah,
well,” he grumbled, “Hrothgar wouldn’t much like it if I let something happen to you. Besides, we’re
foster broth-ers now, eh?”
Through Eragon, Saphira asked, What about the other dwarves? Aren’t they under your command?
A twinkle sprang into Orik’s eyes. “Why, yes, so they are. And they’ll be joining us before long. Seeing
as Eragon’s a member of Dûrgrimst Ingeitum, it’s only right we fight the Empire together. That way, the
two of you won’t be so vulnerable; you can concentrate on finding Galba-torix’s magicians instead of
defending yourselves from constant attacks.”
“A good idea. Thank you.” Orik grunted an acknowledgment. Then Er-agon asked, “What do you think
about Nasuada and the Urgals?”
“She made the right choice.”
“You agree with her!”
“I do. I don’t like it any more than you, but I do.”
Silence enveloped them after that. Eragon sat against Saphira and stared out at the Empire, trying to
prevent his growing anxiety from over-whelming him. Minutes dragged by. To him, the interminable
waiting be-fore a battle was as stressful as the actual fighting. He oiled Saphira’s sad-dle, polished rust
off his hauberk, and then resumed familiarizing himself with the minds of Du Vrangr Gata, anything to
pass the time.
Over an hour later, he paused as he sensed two beings approaching from across the no-man’s-land.
Angela? Solembum? Puzzled and alarmed, he woke Orik—who had dozed off—and told him what he
had discov-ered.
The dwarf frowned and drew his war ax from his belt. “I’ve only met the herbalist a few times, but she
didn’t seem like the sort who would betray us. She’s been welcome among the Varden for decades.”
“We should still find out what she was doing,” said Eragon.
Together they picked their way through the camp to intercept the duo as they approached the
fortifications. Angela soon trotted into the light, Solembum at her heels. The witch was muffled in a dark,
full-length cloak that allowed her to blend into the mottled landscape. Displaying a surprising amount of

Page 682

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

alacrity, strength, and flexibility, she clambered over the many rows of breastwork the dwarves had
engineered, swinging from pole to pole, leaping over trenches, and finally running helter-skelter down the
steep face of the last rampart to stop, panting, by Saphira.
Throwing back the hood of her cloak, Angela flashed them a bright smile. “A welcoming committee!
How thoughtful of you.” As she spoke, the werecat shivered along his length, fur rippling. Then his outline
blurred as if seen through cloudy water, resolving once more into the nude figure of a shaggy-haired boy.
Angela dipped her hand into a leather purse at her belt and passed a child’s tunic and breeches back to
Solem-bum, along with the small black dagger he fought with.
“What were you doing out there?” asked Orik, peering at them with a suspicious gaze.
“Oh, this and that.”
“I think you better tell us,” said Eragon.
Her face hardened. “Is that so? Don’t you trust Solembum and me?” The werecat bared his pointed
teeth.
“Not really,” admitted Eragon, but with a small smile.
“That’s good,” said Angela. She patted him on the cheek. “You’ll live longer. If you must know, then, I
was doing my best to help defeat the Empire, only my methods don’t involve yelling and running around
with a sword.”
“And what exactly are your methods?” growled Orik.
Angela paused to roll up her cloak into a tight bundle, which she stored in her purse. “I’d rather not say;
I want it to be a surprise. You won’t have to wait long to find out. It’ll start in a few hours.”
Orik tugged on his beard. “What will start? If you can’t give us a straight answer, we’ll have to take you
to Nasuada. Maybe she can wring some sense out of you.”
“It’s no use dragging me off to Nasuada,” said Angela. “She gave me permission to cross lines.”
“So you say,” challenged Orik, ever more belligerent.
“And so I say,” announced Nasuada, walking up to them from behind, as Eragon knew she would. He
also sensed that she was accompanied by four Kull, one of whom was Garzhvog. Scowling, he turned to
face them, making no attempt to hide his anger at the Urgals’ presence.
“My Lady,” muttered Eragon.
Orik was not as composed; he jumped back with a mighty oath, grasp-ing his war ax. He quickly
realized that they were not under attack and gave Nasuada a terse greeting. But his hand never left the
haft of his weapon and his eyes never left the hulking Urgals. Angela seemed to have no such inhibitions.
She paid Nasuada the respect due to her, then addressed the Urgals in their own harsh language, to
which they an-swered with evident delight.
Nasuada drew Eragon off to the side so they could have a measure of privacy. There, she said, “I need
you to put aside your feelings for a mo-ment and judge what I am about to tell you with logic and reason.

Page 683

Can you do that?” He nodded, stiff-faced. “Good. I’m doing everything I can to ensure we don’t lose
tomorrow. It doesn’t matter, though, how well we fight, or how well I lead the Varden, or even if we rout
the Empire if you, ” she poked him in the chest, “are killed. Do you understand?” He nodded again.
“There’s nothing I can do to protect you if Galbatorix re-veals himself; if he does, you will face him alone.
Du Vrangr Gata poses no more of a threat to him than they do to you, and I’ll not have them eradicated
without reason.”
“I have always known,” said Eragon, “that I would face Galbatorix alone but for Saphira.”
A sad smile touched Nasuada’s lips. She looked very tired in the flicker-ing torchlight. “Well, there’s no
reason to invent trouble where none ex-ists. It’s possible Galbatorix isn’t even here.” She did not seem to
believe her own words, though. “In any case, I can at least keep you from dying from a sword in the gut.
I heard what the dwarves intend to do, and I thought I could improve upon the concept. I asked
Garzhvog and three of his rams to be your guards, so long as they agreed—which they have— to let you
examine their minds for treachery.”
Eragon went rigid. “You can’t expect me to fight with those monsters. Besides, I already accepted the
dwarves’ offer to defend Saphira and me. They would take it poorly if I rejected them in favor of
Urgals.”
“Then they can both guard you,” retorted Nasuada. She searched his face for a long time, looking for
what he could not tell. “Oh, Eragon. I’d hoped you could see past your hate. What else would you do in
my posi-tion?” She sighed when he remained silent. “If anyone has cause to hold a grudge against the
Urgals, it is I. They killed my father. Yet I cannot al-low that to interfere with deciding what’s best for the
Varden.... At least ask Saphira’s opinion before you say yea or nay. I can order you to accept the
Urgals’ protection, but I would rather not.”
You’re being foolish,observed Saphira without prompting.
Foolish to not want Kull watching my back?
No, foolish to refuse help, no matter where it comes from, in our present situation. Think. You know
what Oromis would do, and you know what he would say. Don’t you trust his judgment?
He can’t be right about everything,said Eragon.
That’s no argument.... Search yourself, Eragon, and tell me whether I speak the truth. You know the
correct path. I would be disappointed if you could not bring yourself to embrace it.
Saphira and Nasuada’s cajoling only made Eragon more reluctant to agree. Still, he knew he had no
choice. “All right, I’ll let them guard me, but only if I find nothing suspicious in their minds. Will you
promise that, after this battle, you won’t make me work with an Urgal again?”
Nasuada shook her head. “I can’t do that, not when it might hurt the Varden.” She paused and said,
“Oh, and Eragon?”
“Yes, my Lady?”
“In the event of my death, I have chosen you as my successor. If that should happen, I suggest you rely
upon Jörmundur’s advice—he has more experience than the other members of the Council of
Elders—and I would expect you to place the welfare of those underneath you before all else. Am I clear,

Eragon?”
Her announcement caught him by surprise. Nothing meant more to her than the Varden. Offering it to
him was the greatest act of trust she could make. Her confidence humbled and touched him; he bowed
his head. “I would strive to be as good a leader as you and Ajihad have been. You honor me, Nasuada.”
“Yes, I do.” Turning away from him, she rejoined the others.
Still overwhelmed by Nasuada’s revelation, and finding his anger tem-pered by it, Eragon slowly walked
back to Saphira. He studied Garzhvog and the other Urgals, trying to gauge their mood, but their features
were so different from those he was accustomed to, he could discern nothing more than the broadest of
emotions. Nor could he find any empathy within himself for the Urgals. To him, they were feral beasts
that would kill him as soon as not and were incapable of love, kindness, or even true intelligence. In
short, they were lesser beings.
Deep within his mind, Saphira whispered, I’m sure Galbatorix is of the same opinion.
And for good reason,he growled, intending to shock her. Suppressing his revulsion, he said out loud,
“Nar Garzhvog, I am told that the four of you agreed to allow me within your minds.”
“That is so, Firesword. Lady Nightstalker told us what was required. We are honored to have the
chance to battle alongside such a mighty warrior, and one who has done so much for us.”
“What do you mean? I have killed scores of your kin.” Unbidden, ex-cerpts from one of Oromis’s
scrolls rose in Eragon’s memory. He remem-bered reading that Urgals, both male and female,
determined their rank in society through combat, and that it was this practice, above all else, that had led
to so many conflicts between Urgals and other races. Which meant, he realized, that if they admired his
feats in battle, then they may have accorded him the same status as one of their war chiefs.
“By killing Durza, you freed us from his control. We are in your debt, Firesword. None of our rams will
challenge you, and if you visit our halls, you and the dragon, Flametongue, will be welcomed as no
outsiders ever before.”
Of all the responses Eragon had expected, gratitude was the last, and it was the one he was least
prepared to deal with. Unable to think of any-thing else, he said, “I won’t forget.” He switched his gaze
to the other Ur-gals, then returned it to Garzhvog and his yellow eyes. “Are you ready?”
“Aye, Rider.”
As Eragon reached toward Garzhvog’s consciousness, it reminded him of how the Twins invaded his
mind when he first entered Farthen Dûr. That observation was swept away as he immersed himself in the
Urgal’s identity. The very nature of his search—looking for malevolent intent perhaps hidden somewhere
in Garzhvog’s past—meant Eragon had to examine years of memories. Unlike the Twins, Eragon
avoided causing deliberate pain, but he was not overly gentle. He could feel Garzhvog flinch with
occasional pangs of discomfort. Like dwarves and elves, the mind of an Urgal possessed different
elements than a human mind. Its structure emphasized rigidity and hierarchy—a result of the tribes the
Urgals organized themselves into—but it felt rough and raw, brutal and cunning: the mind of a wild
animal.
Though he made no effort to learn more about Garzhvog as an individ-ual, Eragon could not help
absorbing pieces of the Urgal’s life. Garzhvog did not resist. Indeed, he seemed eager to share his

Page 685

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

experiences, to con-vince Eragon that Urgals were not his born enemies. We cannot afford to have
another Rider rise up who seeks to destroy us, said Garzhvog. Look well, O Firesword, and see if
we are truly the monsters you call us....
So many images and sensations flashed between them, Eragon almost lost track: Garzhvog’s childhood
with the other members of his brood in a ramshackle village built deep in the heart of the Spine; his dam
brush-ing his hair with an antler comb and singing a soft song; learning to hunt deer and other prey with
his bare hands; growing larger and larger until it was apparent that the old blood still flowed in his veins
and he would stand over eight feet tall, making him a Kull; the dozens of challenges he made, accepted,
and won; venturing out of the village to gain renown, so he might mate, and gradually learning to hate,
distrust, and fear—yes, fear —a world that had condemned his race; fighting in Farthen Dûr;
discov-ering they had been manipulated by Durza; and realizing that their only hope of a better life was to
put aside old differences, befriend the Varden, and see Galbatorix overthrown. Nowhere was there
evidence that Garzhvog lied.
Eragon could not understand what he had seen. Tearing himself from Garzhvog’s mind, he dove into
each of the three remaining Urgals. Their memories confirmed the facts presented by Garzhvog. They
made no at-tempt to conceal that they had killed humans, but it had been done at the command of Durza
when the sorcerer controlled them, or when fighting humans over food or land. We did what we had to
in order to care for our families, they said.
When he finished, Eragon stood before Garzhvog and knew the Urgal’s bloodline was as regal as any
prince’s. He knew that, though uneducated, Garzhvog was a brilliant commander and as great a thinker
and philoso-pher as Oromis himself. He’s certainly brighter than me, admitted Eragon to Saphira.
Baring his throat as a sign of respect, he said out loud, “Nar Garzhvog,” and for the first time, he was
aware of the lofty origins of the title nar. “I am proud to have you at my side. You may tell the Herndall
that so long as the Urgals remain true to their word and do not turn against the Varden, I shall not oppose
you.” Eragon doubted that he would ever like an Urgal, but the iron certitude of his prejudice only a few
minutes before now seemed ignorant, and he could not retain it in good conscience.
Saphira flicked him on the arm with her barbed tongue, making the mail clink together. It takes courage
to admit you were wrong.
Only if you are afraid of looking foolish, and I would have looked far more foolish if I persisted with an
erroneous belief.
Why, little one, you just said something wise.Despite her teasing, he could sense her warm pride in what
he had accomplished.
“Again, we are in your debt, Firesword,” said Garzhvog. He and the other Urgals pressed their fists
against their jutting brows.
Eragon could tell that Nasuada wanted to know the details of what had just transpired but that she
restrained herself. “Good. Now that this is settled, I must be off. Eragon, you’ll receive my signal from
Trianna when the time has arrived.” With that she strode away into the darkness.
As Eragon settled against Saphira, Orik sidled up to him. “It’s lucky we dwarves are going to be here,
eh? We’ll watch the Kull like hawks, we will. We won’t let them catch you while your back is turned.
The mo-ment they attack, we’ll cut their legs out from under them.”
“I thought you agreed with Nasuada’s accepting the Urgals’ offer.”

Page 686

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“That doesn’t mean I trust them or want to be right alongside them, now does it?” Eragon smiled and did
not bother to argue; it would be im-possible to convince Orik that the Urgals were not rapacious killers
when he himself had refused to consider the possibility until sharing an Urgal’s memories.
The night lay heavy around them as they waited for dawn. Orik re-moved a whetstone from his pocket
and proceeded to hone the edge of his curved ax. Once they arrived, the six other dwarves did the same,
and the rasp of metal on stone filled the air with a grating chorus. The Kull sat back to back, chanting
death songs under their breaths. Eragon spent the time casting wards about himself, Saphira, Nasuada,
Orik, and even Arya. He knew that it was dangerous to protect so many, but he could not bear it if they
were harmed. When he finished, he transferred what power he dared into the diamonds embedded within
the belt of Beloth the Wise.
Eragon watched with interest as Angela clad herself in green and black armor and then, taking out a
carved-wood case, assembled her staff-sword from two separate handles that attached in the middle and
two blades of watered steel that threaded into the ends of the resulting pole. She twirled the completed
weapon around her head a few times before seeming satisfied that it would hold up to the shock of battle.
The dwarves eyed her with disapproval, and Eragon heard one grumble, “... blasphemy that any but
Dûrgrimst Quan should wield the hûthvír.”
After that the only sound was the discordant music of the dwarves honing their blades.
It was near dawn when the cries began. Eragon and Saphira noticed them first because of their
heightened senses, but the agonized screams were soon loud enough for the others to hear. Rising to his
feet, Orik looked out toward the Empire, where the cacophony originated. “What manner of creatures
are they torturing to extract such fearsome howls? The sound chills the marrow in my bones, it does.”
“I told you that you wouldn’t have to wait very long,” said Angela. Her former cheer had deserted her;
she looked pale, drawn, and gray in the face, as if she were ill.
From his post by Saphira, Eragon asked, “ Youdid this?”
“Aye. I poisoned their stew, their bread, their drink—anything I could get my hands on. Some will die
now, others will die later as the various toxins take their toll. I slipped the officers nightshade and other
such poi-sons so they will hallucinate in battle.” She tried to smile, but without much success. “Not a very
honorable way to fight, I suppose, but I’d rather do this than be killed. Confusion to our enemies and all
that.”
“Only a coward or a thief uses poison!” exclaimed Orik. “What glory is there in defeating a sick
opponent?” The screams intensified even as he spoke.
Angela gave an unpleasant laugh. “Glory? If you want glory, there are thousands more troops I didn’t
poison. I’m sure you will have your fill of glory by the end of today.”
“Is this why you needed the equipment in Orrin’s tent?” asked Eragon. He found her deed repugnant but
did not pretend to know whether it was good or evil. It was necessary. Angela had poisoned the soldiers
for the same reason Nasuada had accepted the Urgals’ offer of friendship— because it might be their
only hope of survival.
“That’s right.”

Page 687

The soldiers’ wails increased in number until Eragon longed to plug his ears and block out the sound. It
made him wince and fidget, and it put his teeth on edge. He forced himself to listen, though. This was the
cost of resisting the Empire. It would be wrong to ignore it. So he sat with his hands clenched into fists
and his jaw forming painful knots while the Burning Plains echoed with the disembodied voices of dying
men.
THE STORM BREAKS

The first horizontal rays of dawn already streaked across the land when Trianna said to Eragon, It is
time. A surge of energy erased Eragon’s sleepiness. Jumping to his feet, he shouted the word to
everyone around him, even as he clambered into Saphira’s saddle, pulling his new bow from its quiver.
The Kull and dwarves surrounded Saphira, and together they hurried down the breastwork until they
reached the opening that had been cleared during the night.
The Varden poured through the gap, quiet as they could be. Rank upon rank of warriors marched past,
their armor and weapons padded with rags so no sound would alert the Empire of their approach.
Saphira joined the procession when Nasuada appeared on a roan charger in the midst of the men, Arya
and Trianna by her side. The five of them ac-knowledged each other with quick glances, nothing more.
During the night, the mephitic vapors had accumulated low to the ground, and now the dim morning light
gilded the turgid clouds, turning them opaque. Thus, the Varden managed to cross three-quarters of the
no-man’s-land before they were seen by the Empire’s sentries. As the alarm horns rang out before them,
Nasuada shouted, “Now, Eragon! Tell Orrin to strike. To me, men of the Varden! Fight to win back
your homes. Fight to guard your wives and children! Fight to overthrow Gal-batorix! Attack and bathe
your blades in the blood of our enemies! Charge!” She spurred her horse forward, and with a great
bellow, the men followed, shaking their weapons above their heads.
Eragon conveyed Nasuada’s order to Barden, the spellcaster who rode with King Orrin. A moment
later, he heard the drumming of hooves as Orrin and his cavalry—accompanied by the rest of the Kull,
who could run as fast as horses—galloped out of the east. They charged into the Empire’s flank, pinning
the soldiers against the Jiet River and distracting them long enough for the Varden to cross the remainder
of the distance between them without opposition.
The two armies collided with a deafening roar. Pikes clashed against spears, hammers against shields,
swords against helms, and above it all whirled the hungry gore-crows uttering their harsh croaks, driven
into a frenzy by the smell of fresh meat below.
Eragon’s heart leaped within his chest. I must now kill or be killed. Al-most immediately he felt his
wards drawing upon his strength as they de-flected attacks from Arya, Orik, Nasuada, and Saphira.
Saphira held back from the leading edge of the battle, for they would be too exposed to Galbatorix’s
magicians at the front. Taking a deep breath, Eragon began to search for those magicians with his mind,
firing arrows all the while.
Du Vrangr Gata found the first enemy spellcaster. The instant he was alerted, Eragon reached out to the
woman who made the discovery, and from there to the foe she grappled with. Bringing the full power of
his will to bear, Eragon demolished the magician’s resistance, took control of his consciousness—doing
his best to ignore the man’s terror—determined which troops the man was guarding, and slew the man

Page 688

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

with one of the twelve words of death. Without pause, Eragon located the minds of each of the
now-unprotected soldiers and killed them as well. The Varden cheered as the knot of men went limp.
The ease with which he slew them amazed Eragon. The soldiers had had no chance to escape or fight
back. How different from Farthen Dûr, he thought. Though he marveled at the perfection of his skills,
the deaths sickened him. But there was no time to dwell on it.
Recovering from the Varden’s initial assault, the Empire began to man their engines of war: catapults that
cast round missiles of hard-baked ce-ramic, trebuchets armed with barrels of liquid fire, and ballistae that
bombarded the attackers with a hail of arrows six feet long. The ceramic balls and the liquid fire caused
terrific damage when they landed. One ball exploded against the ground not ten yards from Saphira. As
Eragon ducked behind his shield, a jagged fragment spun toward his head, only to be stopped dead in
the air by one of his wards. He blinked at the sudden loss of energy.
The engines soon stalled the Varden’s advance, sowing mayhem wher-ever they aimed. They have to
be destroyed if we’re going to last long enough to wear down the Empire, realized Eragon. It would
be easy for Saphira to dismantle the machines, but she dared not fly among the sol-diers for fear of an
attack by magic.
Breaking through the Varden lines, eight soldiers stormed toward Saphira, jabbing at her with pikes.
Before Eragon could draw Zar’roc, the dwarves and Kull eliminated the entire group.
“A good fight!” roared Garzhvog.
“A good fight!” agreed Orik with a bloody grin.
Eragon did not use spells against the engines; they would be protected against any conceivable
enchantment. Unless... Extending himself, he found the mind of a soldier who tended one of the
catapults. Though he was sure the soldier was defended by some magician, Eragon was able to gain
dominance over him and direct his actions from afar. He guided the man up to the weapon, which was
being loaded, then had him use his sword to hack at the skein of twisted rope that powered the machine.
The rope was too thick to sever before the soldier was dragged away by his comrades, but the damage
was already done. With a mighty crack, the partially wound skein broke, sending the arm of the catapult
flying backward and injuring several men. His lips curled in a grim smile, Er-agon proceeded to the next
catapult and, in short order, disabled the re-mainder of the engines.
Returning to himself, Eragon became aware of dozens of the Varden collapsing around Saphira; one of
Du Vrangr Gata had been over-whelmed. He uttered a dreadful curse and flung himself back along the
trail of magic as he searched for the man who cast the fatal spell, entrust-ing the welfare of his body to
Saphira and his guards.
For over an hour, Eragon hunted Galbatorix’s magicians, but to little avail, for they were wily and
cunning and did not directly attack him. Their reticence puzzled Eragon until he tore from the mind of one
spell-caster—moments before he committed suicide—the thought, ... ordered not to kill you or the
dragon... not to kill you or the dragon.
That answers my question,he said to Saphira, but why does Galbatorix still want us alive? We’ve
made it clear we support the Varden.
Before she could respond, Nasuada appeared before them, her face streaked with filth and gore, her
shield covered with dents, blood sheet-ing down her left leg from a wound on her thigh. “Eragon,” she

Page 689

gasped. “I need you, both of you, to fight, to show yourselves and embolden the men... to frighten the
soldiers.”
Her condition shocked Eragon. “Let me heal you first,” he cried, afraid she might faint. I should have
put more wards around her.
“No! I can wait, but we are lost unless you stem the tide of soldiers.” Her eyes were glazed and empty,
blank holes in her face. “We need... a Rider.” She swayed in her saddle.
Eragon saluted her with Zar’roc. “You have one, my Lady.”
“Go,” she said, “and may what gods there are watch over you.”
Eragon was too high on Saphira’s back to strike his enemies below, so he dismounted and positioned
himself by her right paw. To Orik and Garzhvog, he said, “Protect Saphira’s left side. And whatever you
do, don’t get in our way.”
“You will be overrun, Firesword.”
“No,” said Eragon, “I won’t. Now take your places!” As they did, he put his hand on Saphira’s leg and
looked her in one clear-cut sapphire eye. Shall we dance, friend of my heart?
We shall, little one.
Then he and she merged their identities to a greater degree than ever before, vanquishing all differences
between them to become a single en-tity. They bellowed, leaped forward, and forged a path to the front
line. Once there, Eragon could not tell from whose mouth emanated the rav-enous jet of flame that
consumed a dozen soldiers, cooking them in their mail, nor whose arm it was that brought Zar’roc down
in an arc, cleaving a soldier’s helm in half.
The metallic scent of blood clogged the air, and curtains of smoke wafted over the Burning Plains,
alternately concealing and revealing the knots, clumps, ranks, and battalions of thrashing bodies.
Overhead, the carrion birds waited for their meal and the sun climbed in the firmament toward noon.
From the minds of those around them, Eragon and Saphira caught glimpses of how they appeared.
Saphira was always noticed first: a great ravening creature with claws and fangs dyed red, who slew all in
her path with swipes of her paws and lashes of her tail and with billowing waves of flame that engulfed
entire platoons of soldiers. Her brilliant scales glit-tered like stars and nearly blinded her foes with their
reflected light. Next they saw Eragon running alongside Saphira. He moved faster than the soldiers could
react and, with strength beyond men, splintered shields with a single blow, rent armor, and clove the
swords of those who op-posed him. Shot and dart cast at him fell to the pestilent ground ten feet away,
stopped by his wards.
It was harder for Eragon—and, by extension, Saphira—to fight his own race than it had been to fight the
Urgals in Farthen Dûr. Every time he saw a frightened face or looked into a soldier’s mind, he thought,
This could be me. But he and Saphira could afford no mercy; if a soldier stood before them, he died.
Three times they sallied forth and three times Eragon and Saphira slew every man in the Empire’s first
few ranks before retreating to the main body of the Varden to avoid being surrounded. By the end of
their last attack, Eragon had to reduce or eliminate certain wards around Arya, Orik, Nasuada, Saphira,
and himself in order to keep the spells from ex-hausting him too quickly. For though his strength was

great, so too were the demands of battle.
Ready?he asked Saphira after a brief respite. She growled an affirma-tive.
A cloud of arrows whistled toward Eragon the instant he dove back into combat. Fast as an elf, he
dodged the bulk of them—since his magic no longer protected him from such missiles—caught twelve on
his shield, and stumbled as one struck his belly and one his side. Neither shaft pierced his armor, but they
knocked the wind out of him and left bruises the size of apples. Don’t stop! You’ve dealt with worse
pain than this be-fore, he told himself.
Rushing a cluster of eight soldiers, Eragon darted from one to the next, knocking aside their pikes and
jabbing Zar’roc like a deadly bolt of light-ning. The fighting had dulled his reflexes, though, and one
soldier man-aged to drive his pike through Eragon’s hauberk, slicing his left triceps.
The soldiers cringed as Saphira roared.
Eragon took advantage of the distraction to fortify himself with energy stored within the ruby in Zar’roc’s
pommel and then to kill the three re-maining soldiers.
Sweeping her tail over him, Saphira knocked a score of men out of his way. In the lull that followed,
Eragon looked over at his throbbing arm and said, “Waíse heill.” He also healed his bruises, relying upon
Zar’roc’s ruby, as well as the diamonds in the belt of Beloth the Wise.
Then the two of them pressed onward.
Eragon and Saphira choked the Burning Plains with mountains of their enemies, and yet the Empire
never faltered or fell back. For every man they killed, another stepped forth to take his place. A sense of
hopeless-ness engulfed Eragon as the mass of soldiers gradually forced the Varden to retreat toward
their own camp. He saw his despair mirrored in the faces of Nasuada, Arya, King Orrin, and even
Angela when he passed them in battle.
All our training and we still can’t stop the Empire,raged Eragon. There are just too many soldiers! We
can’t keep this up forever. And Zar’roc and the belt are almost depleted.
You can draw energy from your surroundings if you have to.
I won’t, not unless I kill another of Galbatorix’s magicians and can take it from the soldiers. Otherwise,
I’ll just be hurting the rest of the Varden, since there are no plants or animals here I can use to support
us.
As the long hours dragged by, Eragon grew sore and weary and— stripped of many of his arcane
defenses—accumulated dozens of minor injuries. His left arm went numb from the countless blows that
ham-mered his mangled shield. A scratch on his forehead kept blinding him with rivulets of hot,
sweat-mixed blood. He thought one of his fingers might be broken.
Saphira fared no better. The soldiers’ armor tore the inside of her mouth, dozens of swords and arrows
cut her unprotected wings, and a javelin punctured one of her own plates of armor, wounding her in the
shoulder. Eragon saw the spear coming and tried to deflect it with a spell but was too slow. Whenever
Saphira moved, she splattered the ground with hundreds of drops of blood.
Beside them, three of Orik’s warriors fell, and two of the Kull.

And the sun began its descent toward evening.
As Eragon and Saphira prepared for their seventh and final assault, a trumpet sounded in the east, loud
and clear, and King Orrin shouted, “The dwarves are here! The dwarves are here!”
Dwarves?Eragon blinked and glanced around, confused. He saw noth-ing but soldiers. Then a jolt of
excitement raced through him as he un-derstood. The dwarves! He climbed onto Saphira and she
jumped into the air, hanging for a moment on her tattered wings as they surveyed the bat-tlefield.
It was true—a great host marched out of the east toward the Burning Plains. At its head strode King
Hrothgar, clad in gold mail, his jeweled helm upon his brow, and Volund, his ancient war hammer,
gripped in his iron fist. The dwarf king raised Volund in greeting when he saw Eragon and Saphira.
Eragon howled at the top of his lungs and returned the gesture, bran-dishing Zar’roc in the air. A surge
of renewed vigor made him forget his wounds and feel fierce and determined again. Saphira added her
voice to his, and the Varden looked to her with hope, while the Empire’s soldiers hesitated with fear.
“What did you see?” cried Orik as Saphira dropped back to earth. “Is it Hrothgar? How many warriors
did he bring?”
Ecstatic with relief, Eragon stood in his stirrups and shouted, “Take heart, King Hrothgar is here! And it
looks like every single dwarf is be-hind him! We’ll crush the Empire!” After the men stopped cheering,
he added, “Now take your swords and remind these flea-bitten cowards why they should fear us.
Charge!”
Just as Saphira leaped toward the soldiers, Eragon heard a second cry, this one from the west: “A ship!
A ship is coming up the Jiet River!”
“Blast it,” he snarled. We can’t let a ship land if it’s bringing reinforce-ments for the Empire.
Contacting Trianna, he said, Tell Nasuada that Saphira and I will take care of this. We’ll sink the
ship if it’s from Galba-torix.
As you wish, Argetlam,replied the sorceress.
Without hesitation, Saphira took flight, circling high over the trampled, smoking plain. As the relentless
clamor of combat faded from his ears, Eragon took a deep breath, feeling his mind clear. Below, he was
sur-prised by how scattered both armies had become. The Empire and the Varden had disintegrated into
a series of smaller groups contending against one another over the entire breadth and width of the
Burning Plains. It was into this confused tumult that the dwarves inserted them-selves, catching the
Empire from the side—as Orrin had done earlier with his cavalry.
Eragon lost sight of the battle when Saphira turned to her left and soared through the clouds in the
direction of the Jiet River. A gust of wind blew the peat smoke out of their way and unveiled a large
threemasted ship riding upon the orange water, rowing against the current with two banks of oars. The
ship was scarred and damaged and flew no colors to declare its allegiance. Nevertheless, Eragon readied
himself to destroy the vessel. As Saphira dove toward it, he lifted Zar’roc overhead and loosed his
savage war cry.
CONVERGENCE

Roran stood at the prow of the Dragon Wing and listened to the oars swish through the water. He had
just finished a stint rowing and a cold, jagged ache permeated his right shoulder. Will I always have to
deal with this reminder of the Ra’zac? He wiped the sweat from his face and ignored the discomfort,
concentrating instead on the river ahead, which was ob-scured by a bank of sooty clouds.
Elain joined him at the railing. She rested a hand on her swollen belly. “The water looks evil,” she said.
“Perhaps we should have stayed in Dauth, rather than drag ourselves in search of more trouble.”
He feared she spoke the truth. After the Boar’s Eye, they had sailed east from the Southern Isles back
to the coast and then up the mouth of the Jiet River to Surda’s port city of Dauth. By the time they made
landfall, their stores were exhausted and the villagers sickly.
Roran had every intention of staying in Dauth, especially after they re-ceived an enthusiastic welcome
from its governor, Lady Alarice. But that was before he was told about Galbatorix’s army. If the Varden
were de-feated, he would never see Katrina again. So, with the help of Jeod, he convinced Horst and
many of the other villagers that if they wanted to live in Surda, safe from the Empire, they had to row up
the Jiet River and assist the Varden. It was a difficult task, but in the end Roran prevailed. And once they
told Lady Alarice about their quest, she gave them all the supplies they wanted.
Since then, Roran often wondered if he made the right choice. By now everyone hated living on the
Dragon Wing. People were tense and short-tempered, a situation only aggravated by the knowledge
they were sailing toward a battle. Was it all selfishness on my part? wondered Roran. Did I really do
this for the benefit of the villagers, or only because it will bring me one step closer to finding
Katrina?
“Perhaps we should have,” he said to Elain.
Together they watched as a thick layer of smoke gathered overhead, darkening the sky, obscuring the
sun, and filtering the remaining light so that everything below was colored a nauseating hue of orange. It
pro-duced an eerie twilight the likes of which Roran had never imagined. The sailors on deck looked
about fearfully and muttered charms of protec-tion, pulling out stone amulets to ward off the evil eye.
“Listen,” said Elain. She tilted her head. “What is that?”
Roran strained his ears and caught the faint ring of metal striking metal. “That,” he said, “is the sound of
our destiny.” Twisting, he shouted back over his shoulder, “Captain, there’s fighting just ahead!”
“Man the ballistae!” roared Uthar. “Double-time on those oars, Bonden. An’ every able-bodied man
jack among you better be ready or you’ll be using your guts for pillows!”
Roran remained where he was as the Dragon Wing exploded with ac-tivity. Despite the increase in
noise, he could still hear swords and shields clanging together in the distance. The screams of men were
audible now, as were the roars of some giant beast.
He glanced over as Jeod joined them at the prow. The merchant’s face was pale. “Have you ever been
in battle before?” asked Roran.
The knob in Jeod’s throat bobbed as he swallowed and shook his head. “I got into plenty of fights along
with Brom, but never anything of this scale.”

Page 693

“A first for both of us, then.”
The bank of smoke thinned on the right, providing them with a glimpse of a dark land that belched forth
fire and putrid orange vapor and was covered with masses of struggling men. It was impossible to tell
who was the Empire and who was the Varden, but it was apparent to Roran that the battle could tip in
either direction given the right nudge. We can provide that nudge.
Then a voice echoed over the water as a man shouted, “A ship! A ship is coming up the Jiet River!”
“You should go belowdecks,” said Roran to Elain. “It won’t be safe for you here.” She nodded and
hurried to the fore hatchway, where she climbed down the ladder, closing the opening behind her. A
moment later, Horst bounded up to the prow and handed Roran one of Fisk’s shields.
“Thought you might need that,” said Horst.
“Thanks. I—”
Roran stopped as the air around them vibrated, as if from a mighty concussion. Thud. His teeth jarred
together. Thud. His ears hurt from the pressure. Close upon the heels of the second impact came a
third— thud— and with it a raw-throated yell that Roran recognized, for he had heard it many times in
his childhood. He looked up and beheld a gigantic sapphire dragon diving out of the shifting clouds. And
on the dragon’s back, at the juncture between its neck and shoulders, sat his cousin, Er-agon.
It was not the Eragon he remembered, but rather as if an artist had taken his cousin’s base features and
enhanced them, streamlined them, making them both more noble and more feline. This Eragon was
garbed like a prince, in fine cloth and armor—though tarnished by the grime of war—and in his right hand
he wielded a blade of iridescent red. This Er-agon, Roran knew, could kill without hesitation. This
Eragon was power-ful and implacable.... This Eragon could slay the Ra’zac and their mounts and help
him to rescue Katrina.
Flaring its translucent wings, the dragon pulled up sharply and hung be-fore the ship. Then Eragon met
Roran’s eyes.
Until that moment, Roran had not completely believed Jeod’s story about Eragon and Brom. Now, as
he stared at his cousin, a wave of con-fused emotions washed over him. Eragon is a Rider! It seemed
inconceiv-able that the slight, moody, overeager boy he grew up with had turned into this fearsome
warrior. Seeing him alive again filled Roran with unex-pected joy. Yet, at the same time, a terrible,
familiar anger welled up in-side him over Eragon’s role in Garrow’s death and the siege of Carvahall. In
those few seconds, Roran knew not whether he loved or hated Eragon.
He stiffened with alarm as a vast and alien being touched his mind. From that consciousness emanated
Eragon’s voice: Roran?
“Aye.”
Think your answers and I’ll hear them. Is everyone from Carvahall with you?
Just about.
How did you... No, we can’t go into it; there’s no time. Stay where you are until the battle is decided.

Page 694

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Better yet, go back farther down the river, where the Empire can’t attack you.
We have to talk, Eragon. You have much to answer for.
Eragon hesitated with a troubled expression, then said, I know. But not now, later. With no visible
prompting, the dragon veered away from the ship and flew off to the east, vanishing in the haze over the
Burning Plains.
In an awed voice, Horst said, “A Rider! A real Rider! I never thought I’d see the day, much less that it
would be Eragon.” He shook his head. “I guess you told us the truth, eh, Longshanks?” Jeod grinned in
response, looking like a delighted child.
Their words sounded muted to Roran as he stared at the deck, feeling like he was about to explode with
tension. A host of unanswerable ques-tions assailed him. He forced himself to ignore them. I can’t think
about Eragon now. We have to fight. The Varden must defeat the Empire.
A rising tide of fury consumed him. He had experienced this before, a berserk frenzy that allowed him to
overcome nearly any obstacle, to move objects he could not shift ordinarily, to face an enemy in combat
and feel no fear. It gripped him now, a fever in his veins, quickening his breath and setting his heart
a-pounding.
He pushed himself off the railing, ran the length of the ship to the quarterdeck, where Uthar stood by the
wheel, and said, “Ground the ship.”
“What?”
“Ground the ship, I say! Stay here with the rest of the soldiers and use the ballistae to wreak what havoc
you can, keep the Dragon Wing from being boarded, and guard our families with your lives.
Understand?”
Uthar stared at him with flat eyes, and Roran feared he would not ac-cept the orders. Then the scarred
sailor grunted and said, “Aye, aye, Stronghammer.”
Horst’s heavy tread preceded his arrival at the quarterdeck. “What do you intend to do, Roran?”
“Do?” Roran laughed and spun widdershins to stand toe to toe with the smith. “Do? Why, I intend to
alter the fate of Alagaësia!”
ELDEST

Eragon barely noticed as Saphira carried him back into the swirling confusion of the battle. He had
known that Roran was at sea, but it never occurred to him that Roran might be heading for Surda, nor
that they would reunite in this manner. And Roran’s eyes! His eyes seemed to bore into Eragon,
questioning, relieved, enraged... accusing.In them, Eragon saw that his cousin had learned of Eragon’s
role in Garrow’s death and had not yet forgiven him.
It was only when a sword bounced off his greaves that Eragon returned his attention to his surroundings.
He unleashed a hoarse shout and slashed downward, cutting away the soldier who struck him. Cursing
himself for being so careless, Eragon reached out to Trianna and said, No one on that ship is an enemy.

Page 695

Spread the word that they’re not to be attacked. Ask Nasuada if, as a favor to us, she can send a
herald to explain the situation to them and see that they stay away from the fighting.
As you wish, Argetlam.
From the western flank of the battle, where she alighted, Saphira trav-ersed the Burning Plains in a few
giant leaps, stopping before Hrothgar and his dwarves. Dismounting, Eragon went to the king, who said,
“Hail, Argetlam! Hail, Saphira! The elves seem to have done more for you than they promised.” Beside
him stood Orik.
“No, sir, it was the dragons.”
“Really? I must hear your adventures once our bloody work here is done. I’m glad you accepted my
offer to become Dûrgrimst Ingeitum. It is an honor to have you as mine kin.”
“And you mine.”
Hrothgar laughed, then turned to Saphira and said, “I still haven’t for-gotten your vow to mend Isidar
Mithrim, dragon. Even now, our artisans are assembling the star sapphire in the center of Tronjheim. I
look for-ward to seeing it whole once again.”
She bowed her head. As I promised, so it shall be.
After Eragon repeated her words, Hrothgar reached out with a gnarled finger and tapped one of the
metal plates on her side. “I see you wear our armor. I hope it has served you well.”
Very well, King Hrothgar,said Saphira through Eragon. It has saved me many an injury.
Hrothgar straightened and lifted Volund, a twinkle in his deep-set eyes. “Well then, shall we march out
and test it once again in the forge of war?” He looked back at his warriors and shouted, “Akh sartos oen
dûr-grimst!”
“Vor Hrothgarz korda! Vor Hrothgarz korda!”
Eragon looked at Orik, who translated with a mighty yell, “By Hroth-gar’s hammer!” Joining the chant,
Eragon ran with the dwarf king toward the crimson ranks of soldiers, Saphira by his side.
Now at last, with the help of the dwarves, the battle turned in favor of the Varden. Together they pushed
back the Empire, dividing them, crushing them, forcing Galbatorix’s vast army to abandon positions they
had held since morn. Their efforts were helped by the fact that more of Angela’s poisons had taken
effect. Many of the Empire’s officers behaved irrationally, giving orders that made it easier for the Varden
to penetrate deeper into the army, sowing chaos as they went. The soldiers seemed to realize that fortune
no longer smiled upon them, for hundreds surren-dered, or defected outright and turned on their former
comrades, or threw down their weapons and fled.
And the day passed into the late afternoon.
Eragon was in the midst of fighting two soldiers when a flaming javelin roared past overhead and buried
itself in one of the Empire’s command tents twenty yards away, igniting the fabric. Dispatching his
opponents, Eragon glanced back and saw dozens of fiery missiles arcing out from the ship on the Jiet
River. What are you playing at, Roran? wondered Eragon before charging the next batch of soldiers.

Soon afterward, a horn echoed from the rear of the Empire’s army, then another and another. Someone
began to pound a sonorous drum, the peals of which stilled the field as everyone looked about for the
source of the beat. Even as Eragon watched, an ominous figure detached itself from the horizon in the
north and rose up in the lurid sky over the Burning Plains. The gore-crows scattered before the barbed
black shadow, which balanced motionless upon the thermals. At first Eragon thought it a Lethrblaka, one
of the Ra’zac’s mounts. Then a ray of light escaped the clouds and struck the figure crossways from the
west.
A red dragon floated above them, glowing and sparkling in the sun-beam like a bed of blood-red coals.
His wing membranes were the color of wine held before a lantern. His claws and teeth and the spikes
along his spine were white as snow. In his vermilion eyes there gleamed a terri-ble glee. On his back was
fixed a saddle, and in that saddle sat a man garbed in polished steel armor and armed with a
hand-and-a-half sword.
Dread clutched at Eragon. Galbatorix managed to get another dragon to hatch!
Then the man in steel raised his left hand and a shaft of crackling ruby energy sprang from his palm and
smote Hrothgar on the breast. The dwarf spellcasters cried out with agony as the energy from their
bodies was consumed trying to block the attack. They collapsed, dead, then Hrothgar clutched his heart
and toppled to the ground. The dwarves gave a great groan of despair as they saw their king fall.
“No!” cried Eragon, and Saphira roared in protest. He glared with hate at the enemy Rider. I’ll kill you
for that.
Eragon knew that, as they were, he and Saphira were too tired to con-front such a mighty opponent.
Glancing around, Eragon spotted a horse lying in the mud, a spear through its side. The stallion was still
alive. Er-agon put his hand on its neck and murmured, Sleep, brother. Then he transferred the horse’s
remaining vitality into himself and Saphira. It was not enough energy to restore all their strength, but it
soothed their aching muscles and stopped their limbs from shaking.
Rejuvenated, Eragon leaped onto Saphira, shouting, “Orik, take com-mand of your kinsmen!” Across
the field, he saw Arya gaze at him with concern. He put her out of his mind as he tightened the saddle
straps around his legs. Then Saphira launched herself toward the red dragon, pumping her wings at a
furious rate to gain the necessary speed.
I hope you remember your lessons with Glaedr,he said. He tightened his grip on his shield.
Saphira did not answer him but roared out with her thoughts at the other dragon, Traitor! Egg breaker,
oath breaker, murderer! Then as one, she and Eragon assaulted the minds of the pair, seeking to
overwhelm their defenses. The consciousness of the Rider felt strange to Eragon, as if it contained
multitudes; scores of distinct voices whispered in the caverns of his mind, like imprisoned spirits begging
for release.
The instant they made contact, the Rider retaliated with a blast of pure force greater than any even
Oromis was capable of summoning. Eragon retreated deep behind his own barriers, frantically reciting a
scrap of dog-gerel Oromis taught him to use in such predicaments:
Under a cold and empty winter sky
Stood a wee, small man with a silver sword.

Page 697

He jumped and stabbed in a fevered frenzy,
Fighting the shadows massed before him....
The siege on Eragon’s mind abated as Saphira and the red dragon crashed together, two incandescent
meteors colliding head-on. They grappled, kicking each other’s bellies with their hind legs. Their talons
produced hideous screeches as they grated against Saphira’s armor and the red dragon’s flat scales. The
red dragon was smaller than Saphira, but thicker in his legs and shoulders. He managed to kick her off
for a mo-ment, then they closed again, each struggling to get their jaws around the other’s neck.
It was all Eragon could do to keep hold of Zar’roc as the dragons tum-bled toward the ground,
battering one another with terrible blows from their feet and tails. No more than fifty yards above the
Burning Plains, Saphira and the red dragon disengaged, struggling to regain altitude. Once she halted her
descent, Saphira reared her head, like a snake about to strike, and loosed a thick torrent of fire.
It never reached its destination; twelve feet from the red dragon, the fire bifurcated and passed
harmlessly on either side. Blast it, thought Er-agon. Even as the red dragon opened its maw to retaliate,
Eragon cried, “Skölir nosu fra brisingr!” He was just in time. The conflagration swirled around them but
did not even scorch Saphira’s scales.
Now Saphira and the red dragon raced up through the striated smoke into the clear, chill sky beyond,
darting back and forth as they tried to climb above their opponent. The red dragon nipped Saphira’s tail,
and she and Eragon yelped with shared pain. Panting from the effort, Saphira executed a tight backward
loop, ending up behind the dragon, who then pivoted to the left and tried to spiral up and over Saphira.
While the dragons dueled with increasingly complex acrobatics, Eragon became aware of a disturbance
on the Burning Plains: the spellcasters of Du Vrangr Gata were beset by two new magicians from the
Empire. These magicians were far more powerful than those who had preceded them. They had already
killed one of Du Vrangr Gata and were battering past the barriers of a second. Eragon heard Trianna
scream with her mind, Shadeslayer! You have to help us! We can’t stop them. They’ll kill all the
Varden. Help us, it’s the—
Her voice was lost to him as the Rider stabbed at his consciousness. “This must end,” spat Eragon
between clenched teeth as he strove to withstand the onslaught. Over Saphira’s neck, he saw the red
dragon dive toward them, angling beneath Saphira. Eragon dared not open his mind enough to talk with
Saphira, so he said out loud, “Catch me!” With two strokes of Zar’roc, he severed the straps around his
legs and jumped off Saphira’s back.
This is insane,thought Eragon. He laughed with giddy exhilaration as the feeling of weightlessness took
hold of him. The rush of air tore off his helm and made his eyes water and sting. Releasing his shield,
Eragon spread out his arms and legs, as Oromis had taught him, in order to stabi-lize his flight. Below, the
steel-clad Rider noticed Eragon’s action. The red dragon shied to Eragon’s left but could not evade him.
Eragon lashed out with Zar’roc as the dragon’s flank flashed by, and he felt the blade sink into the
creature’s hamstring before his momentum carried him past.
The dragon roared in agony.
The impact of the blow sent Eragon spinning up, down, and around. By the time he managed to stop his
rotation, he had plummeted through the cloud cover and was heading toward a swift and fatal landing on
the Burning Plains. He could stop himself with magic if he had to, but it would drain his last reserves of

energy. He glanced over both his shoul-ders. Come on, Saphira, where are you?
As if in answer, she dropped out of the foul smoke, her wings pressed tight against her body. She
swooped underneath him and opened her wings a bit to slow her fall. Careful not to impale himself on
one of her spikes, Eragon maneuvered himself back into the saddle, welcoming the return of gravity as
she pulled out of the dive.
Never do that to me again,she snapped.
He surveyed the steaming blood that laced Zar’roc’s blade. It worked, didn’t it?
His satisfaction disappeared as he realized that his stunt had placed Saphira at the mercy of the red
dragon. He hurtled at her from above, harrying her this way and that as he forced her toward the ground.
Saphira tried to maneuver out from under him, but every time she did, he dove at her, biting and buffeting
her with his wings in order to make her change course.
The dragons twisted and lunged until their tongues lolled out of their mouths, their tails drooped, and they
gave up flapping and merely glided.
His mind once again closed to all contact, friendly or not, Eragon said out loud, “Land, Saphira; it’s no
good. I’ll fight him on the ground.”
With a grunt of weary resignation, Saphira descended to the nearest flat open area, a small stone plateau
set along the western edge of the Jiet River. The water had turned red from the blood pouring into it from
the battle. Eragon jumped off Saphira once she alighted on the plateau and tested his footing. It was
smooth and hard, with nothing to trip on. He nodded, pleased.
A few seconds later, the red dragon rushed by overhead and settled on the opposite side of the plateau.
He held his left hind leg off the ground to avoid aggravating his wound: a long gash that nearly severed the
mus-cle. The dragon trembled his entire length, like an injured dog. He tried to hop forward, then
stopped and snarled at Eragon.
The enemy Rider unbuckled his legs and slid down the uninjured side of his dragon. Then he walked
around the dragon and examined his leg. Eragon let him; he knew how much pain it would cause the man
to see the damage inflicted on his bonded partner. He waited too long, though, for the Rider muttered a
few indecipherable words, and within the span of three seconds the dragon’s injury was healed.
Eragon shivered with fear. How could he do that so quickly, and with such a short spell? Still,
whoever he might be, the new Rider certainly was not Galbatorix, whose dragon was black.
Eragon clung to that knowledge as he stepped forward to confront the Rider. As they met in the center
of the plateau, Saphira and the red dragon circled in the background.
The Rider grasped his sword with both hands and swung it over his head toward Eragon, who lifted
Zar’roc to defend himself. Their blades collided with a burst of crimson sparks. Then Eragon shoved
back his opponent and started a complex series of blows. He stabbed and parried, dancing on light feet
as he forced the steel-clad Rider to retreat toward the edge of the plateau.
When they reached the edge, the Rider held his ground, fending off Er-agon’s attacks, no matter how
clever. It’s as if he can anticipate my every move, thought Eragon, frustrated. If he were rested, it
would have been easy for him to defeat the Rider, but as it was, he could make no head-way. The Rider

Page 699

did not have the speed and strength of an elf, but his technical skill was better than Vanir’s and as good
as Eragon’s.
Eragon felt a touch of panic when his initial surge of energy began to subside and he had accomplished
nothing more than a slight scratch across the Rider’s gleaming breastplate. The last reserves of power
stored in Zar’roc’s ruby and the belt of Beloth the Wise were only enough to maintain his exertions for
another minute. Then the Rider took a step forward. Then another. And before Eragon knew it, they had
returned to the center of the plateau, where they stood facing each other, exchanging blows.
Zar’roc grew so heavy in his hand, Eragon could barely lift it. His shoul-der burned, he gasped for
breath, and sweat poured off his face. Not even his desire to avenge Hrothgar could help him to
overcome his exhaus-tion.
At last Eragon slipped and fell. Determined not to be killed lying down, he rolled back onto his feet and
stabbed at the Rider, who knocked aside Zar’roc with a lazy flick of his wrist.
The way the Rider flourished his sword afterward—spinning it in a quick circle by his side—suddenly
seemed familiar to Eragon, as did all his preceding swordsmanship. He stared with growing horror at his
en-emy’s hand-and-a-half sword, then back up at the eye slits of his mirrored helm, and shouted, “I
know you!”
He threw himself at the Rider, trapping both swords between their bodies, hooked his fingers underneath
the helm, and ripped it off. And there in the center of the plateau, on the edge of the Burning Plains of
Alagaësia, stood Murtagh.
INHERITANCE

Murtagh grinned. Then he said, “Thrysta vindr,” and a hard ball of air coalesced between them and
struck Eragon in the middle of his chest, tossing him twenty feet across the plateau.
Eragon heard Saphira growl as he landed on his back. His vision flashed red and white, then he curled
into a ball and waited for the pain to re-cede. Any delight he felt in Murtagh’s reappearance was
overwhelmed by the macabre circumstances of their meeting. A unstable mixture of shock, confusion,
and anger boiled within him.
Lowering his sword, Murtagh pointed at Eragon with his steel-encased hand, curling every finger but his
index into a spiny fist. “You never would give up.”
A chill crept along Eragon’s spine, for he recognized the scene from his premonition while rafting the Az
Ragni to Hedarth: A man sprawled in the clotted mud with a dented helm and bloody mail—his face
concealed behind an upthrown arm. An armored hand entered Eragon’s view and pointed at the
downed man with all the authority of fate itself. Past and fu-ture had converged. Now Eragon’s
doom would be decided.
Pushing himself to his feet, he coughed and said, “Murtagh... how can you be alive? I watched the
Urgals drag you underground. I tried to scry you but saw only darkness.”
Murtagh uttered a mirthless laugh. “You saw nothing, just as I saw nothing the times I tried to scry you
during my days in Urû’baen.”

Page 700

“You died, though!” shouted Eragon, almost incoherent. “You died un-der Farthen Dûr. Arya found
your bloody clothes in the tunnels.”
A shadow darkened Murtagh’s face. “No, I did not die. It was the Twins’ doing, Eragon. They took
control of a group of Urgals and ar-ranged the ambush in order to kill Ajihad and capture me. Then they
en-sorcelled me so I could not escape and spirited me off to Urû’baen.”
Eragon shook his head, unable to comprehend what had happened. “But why did you agree to serve
Galbatorix? You told me you hated him. You told me—”
“Agree!” Murtagh laughed again, and this time his outburst contained an edge of madness. “I did not
agree. First Galbatorix punished me for spiting his years of protection during my upbringing in Urû’baen,
for de-fying his will and running away. Then he extracted everything I knew about you, Saphira, and the
Varden.”
“You betrayed us! I was mourning you, and you betrayed us!”
“I had no choice.”
“Ajihad was right to lock you up. He should have let you rot in your cell, then none of this—”
“I had no choice!” snarled Murtagh. “And after Thorn hatched for me, Galbatorix forced both of us to
swear loyalty to him in the ancient lan-guage. We cannot disobey him now.”
Pity and disgust welled inside of Eragon. “You have become your fa-ther.”
A strange gleam leaped into Murtagh’s eyes. “No, not my father. I’m stronger than Morzan ever was.
Galbatorix taught me things about magic you’ve never even dreamed of.... Spells so powerful, the elves
dare not ut-ter them, cowards that they are. Words in the ancient language that were lost until Galbatorix
discovered them. Ways to manipulate energy... Se-crets, terrible secrets, that can destroy your enemies
and fulfill all your desires.”
Eragon thought back to some of Oromis’s lessons and retorted, “Things that should remain secrets.”
“If you knew, you would not say that. Brom was a dabbler, nothing more. And the elves, bah! All they
can do is hide in their forest and wait to be conquered.” Murtagh ran his eyes over Eragon. “You look
like an elf now. Did Islanzadí do that to you?” When Eragon remained silent, Murtagh smiled and
shrugged. “No matter. I’ll learn the truth soon enough.” He stopped, frowned, then looked to the east.
Following his gaze, Eragon saw the Twins standing at the front of the Empire, casting balls of energy into
the midst of the Varden and the dwarves. The curtains of smoke made it difficult to tell, but Eragon was
sure the hairless magicians were grinning and laughing as they slaughtered the men with whom they once
pledged solemn friendship. What the Twins failed to notice—and what was clearly visible to Eragon and
Murtagh from their vantage point—was that Roran was crawling toward them from the side.
Eragon’s heart skipped a beat as he recognized his cousin. You fool! Get away from them! You’ll be
killed .
Just as he opened his mouth to cast a spell that would transport Roran out of danger—no matter the
cost—Murtagh said, “Wait. I want to see what he’ll do.”

Page 701

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“Why?”
A bleak smile crossed Murtagh’s face. “The Twins enjoyed tormenting me when I was their captive.”
Eragon glanced at him, suspicious. “You won’t hurt him? You won’t warn the Twins?”
“Vel eïnradhin iet ai Shur’tugal.” Upon my word as a Rider.
Together they watched as Roran hid behind a mound of bodies. Eragon stiffened as the Twins looked
toward the pile. For a moment, it seemed they had spotted him, then they turned away and Roran
jumped up. He swung his hammer and bashed one of the Twins in the head, cracking open his skull. The
remaining Twin fell to the ground, convulsing, and emitted a wordless scream until he too met his end
under Roran’s ham-mer. Then Roran planted his foot upon the corpses of his foes, lifted his hammer over
his head, and bellowed his victory.
“What now?” demanded Eragon, turning away from the battlefield. “Are you here to kill me?”
“Of course not. Galbatorix wants you alive.”
“What for?”
Murtagh’s lips quirked. “You don’t know? Ha! There’s a fine jest. It’s not because of you; it’s because
of her. ” He jabbed a finger at Saphira. “The dragon inside Galbatorix’s last egg, the last dragon egg in
the world, is male. Saphira is the only female dragon in existence. If she breeds, she will be the mother of
her entire race. Do you see now? Galbatorix doesn’t want to eradicate the dragons. He wants to use
Saphira to rebuild the Riders. He can’t kill you, either of you, if his vision is to become real-ity.... And
what a vision it is, Eragon. You should hear him describe it, then you might not think so badly of him. Is it
evil that he wants to unite Alagaësia under a single banner, eliminate the need for war, and restore the
Riders?”
“He’s the one who destroyed the Riders in the first place!”
“And for good reason,” asserted Murtagh. “They were old, fat, and cor-rupt. The elves controlled them
and used them to subjugate humans. They had to be removed so that we could start anew.”
A furious scowl contorted Eragon’s features. He paced back and forth across the plateau, his breathing
heavy, then gestured at the battle and said, “How can you justify causing so much suffering on the basis
of a madman’s ravings? Galbatorix has done nothing but burn and slaughter and amass power for himself.
He lies. He murders. He manipulates. You know this! It’s why you refused to work for him in the first
place.” Eragon paused, then adopted a gentler tone: “I can understand that you were compelled to act
against your will and that you aren’t responsible for kill-ing Hrothgar. You can try to escape, though. I’m
sure that Arya and I could devise a way to neutralize the bonds Galbatorix has laid upon you.... Join me,
Murtagh. You could do so much for the Varden. With us, you would be praised and admired, instead of
cursed, feared, and hated.”
For a moment, as Murtagh gazed down at his notched sword, Eragon hoped he would accept. Then
Murtagh said in a low voice, “You cannot help me, Eragon. No one but Galbatorix can release us from
our oaths, and he will never do that.... He knows our true names, Eragon.... We are his slaves forever.”
Though he wanted to, Eragon could not deny the sympathy he felt for Murtagh’s plight. With the utmost

Page 702

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

gravity, he said, “Then let us kill the two of you.”
“Kill us! Why should we allow that?”
Eragon chose his words with care: “It would free you from Galbatorix’s control. And it would save the
lives of hundreds, if not thousands, of people. Isn’t that a noble enough cause to sacrifice yourself for?”
Murtagh shook his head. “Maybe for you, but life is still too sweet for me to part with it so easily. No
stranger’s life is more important than Thorn’s or my own.”
As much as he hated it—hated the entire situation, in fact—Eragon knew then what had to be done.
Renewing his attack on Murtagh’s mind, he leaped forward, both feet leaving the ground as he lunged
toward Murtagh, intending to stab him through the heart.
“Letta!” barked Murtagh.
Eragon dropped back to the ground as invisible bands clamped around his arms and legs, immobilizing
him. To his right, Saphira discharged a jet of rippling fire and sprang at Murtagh like a cat pouncing on a
mouse.
“Rïsa!” commanded Murtagh, extending a clawlike hand as if to catch her.
Saphira yelped with surprise as Murtagh’s incantation stopped her in midair and held her in place,
floating several feet above the plateau. No matter how much she wriggled, she could not touch the
ground, nor could she fly any higher.
How can he still be human and have the strength to do that?wondered Eragon. Even with my new
abilities, such a task would leave me gasping for air and unable to walk. Relying upon his
experience counteracting Oromis’s spells, Eragon said, “Brakka du vanyalí sem huildar Saphira un eka!”
Murtagh made no attempt to stop him, only gave him a flat stare, as if he found Eragon’s resistance a
pointless inconvenience. Baring his teeth, Eragon redoubled his efforts. His hands went cold, his bones
ached, and his pulse slowed as the magic sapped his energy. Without being asked, Saphira joined forces
with him, granting him access to the formidable re-sources of her body.
Five seconds passed....
Twenty seconds... A thick vein pulsed on Murtagh’s neck.
A minute...
A minute and a half... Involuntary tremors racked Eragon. His quadri-ceps and hamstrings fluttered, and
his legs would have given way if he were free to move.
Two minutes passed....
At last Eragon was forced to release the magic, else he risked falling un-conscious and passing into the
void. He sagged, utterly spent.
He had been afraid before, but only because he thought he might fail. Now he was afraid because he did
not know what Murtagh was capable of.

Page 703

“You cannot hope to compete with me,” said Murtagh. “No one can, except for Galbatorix.” Walking
up to Eragon, he pointed his sword at Eragon’s neck, pricking his skin. Eragon resisted the impulse to
flinch. “It would be so easy to take you back to Urû’baen.”
Eragon gazed deep into his eyes. “Don’t. Let me go.”
“You just tried to kill me.”
“And you would have done the same in my position.” When Murtagh remained silent and expressionless,
Eragon said, “We were friends once. We fought together. Galbatorix can’t have twisted you so much
that you’ve forgotten.... If you do this, Murtagh, you’ll be lost forever.”
A long minute passed where the only sound was the hue and cry of the clashing armies. Blood trickled
down Eragon’s neck from where the sword point cut him. Saphira lashed her tail with helpless rage.
Finally, Murtagh said, “I was ordered to try and capture you and Saphira.” He paused. “I have tried....
Make sure we don’t cross paths again. Galbatorix will have me swear additional oaths in the ancient
language that will prevent me from showing you such mercy when next we meet.” He lowered his sword.
“You’re doing the right thing,” said Eragon. He tried to step back but was still held in place.
“Perhaps. But before I let you go...” Reaching out, Murtagh pried Zar’roc from Eragon’s fist and
unbuckled Zar’roc’s red sheath from the belt of Be-loth the Wise. “If I have become my father, then I
will have my father’s blade. Thorn is my dragon, and a thorn he shall be to all our enemies. It is only right,
then, that I should also wield the sword Misery . Misery and Thorn, a fit match. Besides, Zar’roc should
have gone to Morzan’s eldest son, not his youngest. It is mine by right of birth.”
A cold pit formed in Eragon’s stomach. It can’t be.
A cruel smile appeared on Murtagh’s face. “I never told you my mother’s name, did I? And you never
told me yours. I’ll say it now: Selena. Selena was my mother and your mother. Morzan was our father.
The Twins figured out the connection while they were digging around in your head. Galbatorix was quite
interested to learn that particular piece of information.”
“You’re lying!” cried Eragon. He could not bear the thought of being Morzan’s son. Did Brom know?
Does Oromis know?... Why didn’t they tell me? He remembered, then, Angela predicting that
someone in his family would betray him. She was right.
Murtagh merely shook his head and repeated his words in the ancient language, then put his lips to
Eragon’s ear and whispered, “You and I, we are the same, Eragon. Mirror images of one another. You
can’t deny it.”
“You’re wrong,” growled Eragon, struggling against the spell. “We’re nothing alike. I don’t have a scar
on my back anymore.”
Murtagh recoiled as if he had been stung, his face going hard and cold. He lifted Zar’roc and held it
upright before his chest. “So be it. I take my inheritance from you, brother. Farewell.”
Then he retrieved his helm from the ground and pulled himself onto Thorn. Not once did he look at
Eragon as the dragon crouched, raised its wings, and flew off the plateau and into the north. Only after

Page 704

Thorn van-ished below the horizon did the web of magic release Eragon and Saphira.
Saphira’s talons clicked on the stone as she landed. She crawled over to Eragon and touched him on the
arm with her snout. Are you all right, lit-tle one?
I’m fine.But he was not, and she knew it.
Walking to the edge of the plateau, Eragon surveyed the Burning Plains and the aftermath of the battle,
for the battle was over. With the death of the Twins, the Varden and dwarves regained lost ground and
were able to rout the formations of confused soldiers, herding them into the river or chasing them back
from whence they came.
Though the bulk of their forces remained intact, the Empire had sounded the retreat, no doubt to regroup
and prepare for a second at-tempt to invade Surda. In their wake, they left piles of tangled corpses from
both sides of the conflict, enough men and dwarves to populate an entire city. Thick black smoke roiled
off the bodies that had fallen into the peat fires.
Now that the fighting had subsided, the hawks and eagles, the crows and ravens, descended like a
shroud over the field.
Eragon closed his eyes, tears leaking from under the lids.
They had won, but he had lost.
REUNION

Eragon and Saphira picked their way between the corpses that littered the Burning Plains, moving slowly
on account of their wounds and their exhaustion. They encountered other survivors staggering through the
scorched battlefield, hollow-eyed men who looked without truly seeing, their gazes focused somewhere
in the distance.
Now that his bloodlust had subsided, Eragon felt nothing but sorrow. The fighting seemed so pointless to
him. What a tragedy that so many must die to thwart a single madman. He paused to sidestep a
thicket of arrows planted in the mud and noticed the gash on Saphira’s tail where Thorn had bitten her,
as well as her other injuries. Here, lend me your strength; I’ll heal you.
Tend to those in mortal danger first.
Are you sure?
Quite sure, little one.
Acquiescing, he bent down and mended a soldier’s torn neck before moving on to one of the Varden.
He made no distinction between friend and foe, treating both to the limit of his abilities.
Eragon was so preoccupied with his thoughts, he paid little attention to his work. He wished he could
repudiate Murtagh’s claim, but everything Murtagh had said about his mother— theirmother—coincided
with the few things Eragon knew about her: Selena left Carvahall twenty-some years ago, returned once
to give birth to Eragon, and was never seen again. His mind darted back to when he and Murtagh first

Page 705

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

arrived in Far-then Dûr. Murtagh had discussed how his mother had vanished from Morzan’s castle while
Morzan was hunting Brom, Jeod, and Saphira’s egg. After Morzan threw Zar’roc at Murtagh and
nearly killed him, Mother must have hidden her pregnancy and then gone back to Carvahall in
order to pro-tect me from Morzan and Galbatorix .
It heartened Eragon to know that Selena had cared for him so deeply. It also grieved him to know she
was dead and they would never meet, for he had nurtured the hope, faint as it was, that his parents might
still be alive. He no longer harbored any desire to be acquainted with his father, but he bitterly resented
that he had been deprived of the chance to have a relationship with his mother.
Ever since he was old enough to understand that he was a fosterling, Eragon had wondered who his
father was and why his mother left him to be raised by her brother, Garrow, and his wife, Marian. Those
answers had been thrust upon him from such an unexpected source, and in such an unpropitious setting, it
was more than he could make sense of at the moment. It would take months, if not years, to come to
terms with the revelation.
Eragon always assumed he would be glad to learn the identity of his fa-ther. Now that he had, the
knowledge revolted him. When he was younger, he often entertained himself by imagining that his father
was someone grand and important, though Eragon knew the opposite was far more likely. Still, it never
occurred to him, even in his most extravagant daydreams, that he might be the son of a Rider, much less
one of the For-sworn.
It turned a daydream into a nightmare.
I was sired by a monster.... My father was the one who betrayed the Rid-ers to Galbatorix.It left Eragon
feeling sullied.
But no...As he healed a man’s broken spine, a new way of viewing the situation occurred to him, one
that restored a measure of his self-confidence: Morzan may be my parent, but he is not my father.
Garrow was my father. He raised me. He taught me how to live well and honorably, with
integrity. I am who I am because of him. Even Brom and Oromis are more my father than
Morzan. And Roran is my brother, not Murtagh.
Eragon nodded, determined to maintain that outlook. Until then, he had refused to completely accept
Garrow as his father. And even though Garrow was dead, doing so relieved Eragon, gave him a sense of
closure, and helped to ameliorate his distress over Morzan.
You have grown wise,observed Saphira.
Wise?He shook his head. No, I’ve just learned how to think. That much, at least, Oromis gave me.
Eragon wiped a layer of dirt off the face of a fallen banner boy, making sure he really was dead, then
straightened, wincing as his muscles spasmed in protest. You realize, don’t you, that Brom must have
known about this. Why else would he choose to hide in Carvahall while he waited for you to
hatch?... He wanted to keep an eye upon his enemy’s son. It unsettled him to think that Brom might
have considered him a threat. And he was right too. Look what ended up hap-pening to me!
Saphira ruffled his hair with a gust of her hot breath. Just remember, whatever Brom’s reasons, he
always tried to protect us from danger. He died saving you from the Ra’zac.
I know.... Do you think he didn’t tell me about this because he was afraid I might emulate Morzan, like
Murtagh has?

Page 706

Of course not.
He looked at her, curious. How can you be so certain? She lifted her head high above him and refused
to meet his eyes or to answer. Have it your way, then. Kneeling by one of King Orrin’s men, who had
an arrow through the gut, Eragon grabbed his arms to stop him from writhing. “Easy now.”
“Water,” groaned the man. “For pity’s sake, water. My throat is as dry as sand. Please, Shadeslayer.”
Sweat beaded his face.
Eragon smiled, trying to comfort him. “I can give you a drink now, but it’d be better if you wait until after
I heal you. Can you wait? If you do, I promise you can have all the water you want.”
“You promise, Shadeslayer?”
“I promise.”
The man visibly struggled against another wave of agony before saying, “If I must.”
With the aid of magic, Eragon drew out the shaft, then he and Saphira worked to repair the man’s
innards, using some of the warrior’s own en-ergy to fuel the spell. It took several minutes. Afterward, the
man exam-ined his belly, pressing his hands against the flawless skin, then gazed at Eragon, tears
brimming in his eyes. “I... Shadeslayer, you...”
Eragon handed him his waterskin. “Here, keep it. You have greater need of it than I.”
A hundred yards beyond, Eragon and Saphira breached an acrid wall of smoke. There they came upon
Orik and ten other dwarves—some women—arrayed around the body of Hrothgar, who lay upon four
shields, resplendent in his golden mail. The dwarves tore at their hair, beat their breasts, and wailed their
lamentations to the sky. Eragon bowed his head and murmured, “Stydja unin mor’ranr, Hrothgar
Könungr.”
After a time, Orik noticed them and rose, his face red from crying and his beard torn free of its usual
braid. He staggered over to Eragon and, without preempt, asked, “Did you kill the coward responsible
for this?”
“He escaped.” Eragon could not bring himself to explain that the Rider was Murtagh.
Orik stamped his fist into his hand. “Barzûln!”
“But I swear to you upon every stone in Alagaësia that, as one of Dûr-grimst Ingeitum, I’ll do everything
I can to avenge Hrothgar’s death.”
“Aye, you’re the only one besides the elves strong enough to bring this foul murderer to justice. And
when you find him... grind his bones to dust, Eragon. Pull his teeth and fill his veins with molten lead;
make him suffer for every minute of Hrothgar’s life that he stole.”
“Wasn’t it a good death? Wouldn’t Hrothgar have wanted to die in bat-tle, with Volund in his hand?”
“In battle, yes, facing an honest foe who dared stand and fight like a man. Not brought low by a
magician’s trickery....” Shaking his head, Orik looked back at Hrothgar, then crossed his arms and

Page 707

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

tucked his chin against his collarbone. He took several ragged breaths. “When my parents died of the
pox, Hrothgar gave me a life again. He took me into his hall. He made me his heir. Losing him...” Orik
pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger, covering his face. “Losing him is like
losing my father again.”
The grief in his voice was so clear, Eragon felt as if he shared the dwarf’s sorrow. “I understand,” he
said.
“I know you do, Eragon.... I know you do.” After a moment, Orik wiped his eyes and gestured at the
ten dwarves. “Before anything else is done, we have to return Hrothgar to Farthen Dûr so he can be
entombed with his predecessors. Dûrgrimst Ingeitum must choose a new grimstborith, and then the
thirteen clan chiefs—including the ones you see here—will select our next king from among themselves.
What happens next, I know not. This tragedy will embolden some clans and turn others against our
cause....” He shook his head again.
Eragon put his hand on Orik’s shoulder. “Don’t worry about that now. You have but to ask, and my
arm and my will are at your service.... If you want, come to my tent and we can share a cask of mead
and toast Hroth-gar’s memory.”
“I’d like that. But not yet. Not until we finish pleading with the gods to grant Hrothgar safe passage to
the afterlife.” Leaving Eragon, Orik re-turned to the circle of dwarves and added his voice to their
keening.
Continuing on through the Burning Plains, Saphira said, Hrothgar was a great king.
Aye, and a good person.Eragon sighed. We should find Arya and Nasuada. I couldn’t even heal a
scratch right now, and they need to know about Murtagh.
Agreed.
They angled south toward the Varden’s encampment, but before they traveled more than a few yards,
Eragon saw Roran approaching from the Jiet River. Trepidation filled him. Roran stopped directly in front
of them, planted his feet wide apart, and stared at Eragon, working his jaw up and down as if he wanted
to talk but was unable to get the words past his teeth.
Then he punched Eragon on the chin.
It would have been easy for Eragon to avoid the blow, but he allowed it to land, rolling away from it a
bit so Roran did not break his knuckles.
It still hurt.
Wincing, Eragon faced his cousin. “I guess I deserved that.”
“That you did. We have to talk.”
“Now?”
“It can’t wait. The Ra’zac captured Katrina, and I need your help to res-cue her. They’ve had her ever
since we left Carvahall.”

Page 708

So that’s it.In an instant, Eragon realized why Roran appeared so grim and haunted, and why he had
brought the entire village to Surda. Brom was right, Galbatorix sent the Ra’zac back to Palancar
Valley. Eragon frowned, torn between his responsibility to Roran and his duty to report to Nasuada.
“There’s something I need to do first, and then we can talk. All right? You can accompany me if you
want....”
“I’ll come.”
As they traversed the pockmarked land, Eragon kept glancing at Roran out of the corner of his eye.
Finally, he said in a low voice, “I missed you.”
Roran faltered, then responded with a curt nod. A few steps later, he asked, “This is Saphira, right?
Jeod said that was her name.”
“Aye.”
Saphira peered at Roran with one of her glittering eyes. He bore her scrutiny without turning away,
which was more than most people could do. I have always wanted to meet Eragon’s nest-mate.
“She speaks!” exclaimed Roran when Eragon repeated her words.
This time Saphira addressed him directly: What? Did you think I was as mute as a rock lizard?
Roran blinked. “I beg your pardon. I didn’t know that dragons were so intelligent.” A grim smile twisted
his lips. “First Ra’zac and magicians, now dwarves, Riders, and talking dragons. It seems the whole
world has gone mad.”
“It does seem that way.”
“I saw you fight that other Rider. Did you wound him? Is that why he fled?”
“Wait. You’ll hear.”
When they reached the pavilion Eragon was searching for, he swept back the flap and ducked inside,
followed by Roran and Saphira, who pushed her head and neck in after them. In the center of the tent,
Nasuada sat on the edge of the table, letting a maid remove her twisted armor while she carried on a
heated discussion with Arya. The cut on her thigh had been healed.
Nasuada stopped in the middle of her sentence as she spotted the new arrivals. Running toward them,
she threw her arms around Eragon and cried, “Where were you? We thought you were dead, or worse.”
“Not quite.”
“The candle still burns,” murmured Arya.
Stepping back, Nasuada said, “We couldn’t see what happened to you and Saphira after you landed on
the plateau. When the red dragon left and you didn’t appear, Arya tried to contact you but felt nothing,
so we assumed...” She trailed off. “We were just debating the best way to trans-port Du Vrangr Gata
and an entire company of warriors across the river.”
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to worry you. I was just so tired after the fight, I forgot to lower my barriers.”

Then Eragon brought Roran forward. “Nasuada, I would like to introduce my cousin, Roran. Ajihad may
have mentioned him to you before. Roran, Lady Nasuada, leader of the Varden and my liegelord. And
this is Arya Svit-kona, the elves’ ambassador.” Ro-ran bowed to each of them in turn.
“It is an honor to meet Eragon’s cousin,” said Nasuada.
“Indeed,” added Arya.
After they finished exchanging greetings, Eragon explained that the en-tire village of Carvahall had
arrived on the Dragon Wing, and that Roran was the one responsible for killing the Twins.
Nasuada lifted a dark eyebrow. “The Varden are in your debt, Roran, for stopping their rampage. Who
knows how much damage the Twins would have caused before Eragon or Arya could have confronted
them? You helped us to win this battle. I won’t forget that. Our supplies are limited, but I will see that
everyone on your ship is clothed and fed, and that your sick are treated.”
Roran bowed even lower. “Thank you, Lady Nasuada.”
“If I weren’t so pressed for time, I would insist upon knowing how and why you and your village evaded
Galbatorix’s men, traveled to Surda, and then found us. Even just the bare facts of your trek make an
extraordi-nary tale. I still intend to learn the specifics—especially since I suspect it concerns Eragon—but
I must deal with other, more urgent matters at the moment.”
“Of course, Lady Nasuada.”
“You may go, then.”
“Please,” said Eragon, “let him stay. He should be here for this.”
Nasuada gave him a quizzical look. “Very well. If you want. But enough of this dawdling. Jump to the
meat of the matter and tell us about the Rider!”
Eragon began with a quick history of the three remaining dragon eggs— two of which had now
hatched—as well as Morzan and Murtagh, so that Roran would understand the significance of his news.
Then he proceeded to describe his and Saphira’s fight with Thorn and the mysterious Rider, paying
special attention to his extraordinary powers. “As soon as he spun his sword around, I realized we had
dueled before, so I threw myself at him and tore off his helm.” Eragon paused.
“It was Murtagh, wasn’t it?” asked Nasuada quietly.
“How... ?”
She sighed. “If the Twins survived, it only made sense that Murtagh had as well. Did he tell you what
really happened that day in Farthen Dûr?” So Eragon recounted how the Twins betrayed the Varden,
recruited the Urgals, and kidnapped Murtagh. A tear rolled down Nasuada’s cheek. “It’s a pity that this
befell Murtagh when he has already endured so much hardship. I enjoyed his company in Tronjheim and
believed he was our ally, despite his upbringing. I find it hard to think of him as our enemy.” Turning to
Roran, she said, “It seems I am also personally in your debt for slaying the traitors who murdered my
father.”
Fathers, mothers, brothers, cousins,thought Eragon. It all comes down to family. Summoning his

Page 710

courage, he completed his report with Murtagh’s theft of Zar’roc and then his final, terrible secret.
“It can’t be,” whispered Nasuada.
Eragon saw shock and revulsion cross Roran’s face before he managed to conceal his reactions. That,
more than anything else, hurt Eragon.
“Could Murtagh have been lying?” asked Arya.
“I don’t see how. When I questioned him, he told me the same thing in the ancient language.”
A long, uncomfortable silence filled the pavilion.
Then Arya said, “No one else can know about this. The Varden are demoralized enough by the
presence of a new Rider. And they’ll be even more upset when they learn it’s Murtagh, whom they
fought alongside and came to trust in Farthen Dûr. If word spreads that Eragon Shade-slayer is Morzan’s
son, the men will grow disillusioned and few people will want to join us. Not even King Orrin should be
told.”
Nasuada rubbed her temples. “I fear you’re right. A new Rider...” She shook her head. “I knew it was
possible for this to occur, but I didn’t really believe it would, since Galbatorix’s remaining eggs had gone
so long without hatching.”
“It has a certain symmetry,” said Eragon.
“Our task is doubly hard now. We may have held our own today, but the Empire still far outnumbers us,
and now we face not one but two Riders, both of whom are stronger than you, Eragon. Do you think you
could defeat Murtagh with the help of the elves’ spellcasters?”
“Maybe. But I doubt he’d be foolish enough to fight them and me to-gether.”
For several minutes, they discussed the effect Murtagh could have on their campaign and strategies to
minimize or eliminate it. At last Nasuada said, “Enough. We cannot decide this when we are bloody and
tired and our minds are clouded from fighting. Go, rest, and we shall take this up again tomorrow.”
As Eragon turned to leave, Arya approached and looked him straight in the eye. “Do not allow this to
trouble you overmuch, Eragon-elda. You are not your father, nor your brother. Their shame is not
yours.”
“Aye,” agreed Nasuada. “Nor imagine that it has lowered our opinion of you.” She reached out and
cupped his face. “I know you, Eragon. You have a good heart. The name of your father cannot change
that.”
Warmth blossomed inside Eragon. He looked from one woman to the next, then twisted his hand over
his chest, overwhelmed by their friend-ship. “Thank you.”
Once they were back out in the open, Eragon put his hands on his hips and took a deep breath of the
smoky air. It was late in the day, and the garish orange of noon had subsided into a dusky gold light that
suffused the camp and battlefield, giving it a strange beauty. “So now you know,” he said.
Roran shrugged. “Blood always tells.”

Page 711

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

“Don’t say that,” growled Eragon. “Don’t ever say that.”
Roran studied him for several seconds. “You’re right; it was an ugly thought. I didn’t mean it.” He
scratched his beard and squinted at the bloated sun resting upon the horizon. “Nasuada wasn’t what I
expected.”
That forced a tired chuckle out of Eragon. “The one you were expect-ing was her father, Ajihad. Still,
she’s as good a leader as he was, if not better.”
“Her skin, is it dyed?”
“No, that’s the way she is.”
Just then, Eragon felt Jeod, Horst, and a score of other men from Car-vahall hurrying toward them. The
villagers slowed as they rounded a tent and glimpsed Saphira. “Horst!” exclaimed Eragon. Stepping
forward, he grasped the smith in a bear hug. “It’s good to see you again!”
Horst gaped at Eragon, then a delighted grin spread across his face. “Blast if it isn’t good to see you as
well, Eragon. You’ve filled out since you left.”
“You mean since I ran away.”
Meeting the villagers was a strange experience for Eragon. Hardship had altered some of the men so
much, he barely recognized them. And they treated him differently than before, with a mixture of awe and
reverence. It reminded him of a dream, where everything familiar is rendered alien. He was disconcerted
by how out of place he felt among them.
When Eragon came to Jeod, he paused. “You know about Brom?”
“Ajihad sent me a message, but I’d like to hear what happened directly from you.”
Eragon nodded, grave. “As soon as I have the chance, we’ll sit down to-gether and have a long talk.”
Then Jeod moved on to Saphira and bowed to her. “I waited my entire life to see a dragon, and now I
have seen two in the same day. I am in-deed lucky. However, you are the dragon I wanted to meet.”
Bending her neck, Saphira touched Jeod on the brow. He shivered at the contact. Give him my thanks
for helping to rescue me from Galbatorix. Otherwise, I would still be languishing in the king’s
treasury. He was Brom’s friend, and so he is our friend.
After Eragon repeated her words, Jeod said, “Atra esterní ono thelduin, Saphira Bjartskular,” surprising
them with his knowledge of the ancient language.
“Where did you go?” Horst asked Roran. “We looked high and low for you after you took off in pursuit
of those two magicians.”
“Never mind that now. Return to the ship and have everyone disem-bark; the Varden are sending us
food and shelter. We can sleep on solid ground tonight!” The men cheered.
Eragon watched with interest as Roran issued his commands. When at last Jeod and the villagers

Page 712

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

departed, Eragon said, “They trust you. Even Horst obeys you without question. Do you speak for all of
Carvahall now?”
“I do.”
Heavy darkness was advancing upon the Burning Plains by the time they found the small two-man tent
the Varden had assigned Eragon. Since Saphira could not fit her head through the opening, she curled up
on the ground beside and prepared to keep watch.
As soon as I get my strength back, I’ll see to your wounds,promised Er-agon.
I know. Don’t stay up too late talking.
Inside the tent, Eragon found an oil lantern that he lit with steel and flint. He could see perfectly well
without it, but Roran needed the light.
They sat opposite each other: Eragon on the bedding laid out along one side of the tent, Roran on a
folding stool he found leaning in a corner. Er-agon was uncertain how to begin, so he remained silent and
stared at the lamp’s dancing flame.
Neither of them moved.
After uncounted minutes, Roran said, “Tell me how my father died.”
“Our father.” Eragon remained calm as Roran’s expression hardened. In a gentle voice, he said, “I have
as much right to call him that as you. Look within yourself; you know it to be true.”
“Fine. Our father, how did he die?”
Eragon had recounted the story upon several occasions. But this time he hid nothing. Instead of just
listing the events, he described what he had thought and felt ever since he had found Saphira’s egg, trying
to make Roran understand why he did what he did. He had never been so anxious before.
“I was wrong to hide Saphira from the rest of the family,” Eragon con-cluded, “but I was afraid you
might insist on killing her, and I didn’t real-ize how much danger she put us in. If I had... After Garrow
died, I de-cided to leave in order to track down the Ra’zac, as well as to avoid put-ting Carvahall in any
more danger.” A humorless laugh escaped him. “It didn’t work, but if I had remained, the soldiers would
have come far sooner. And then who knows? Galbatorix might have even visited Palan-car Valley
himself. I may be the reason Garrow—Father—died, but that was never my intention, nor that you and
everyone else in Carvahall should suffer because of my choices....” He gestured helplessly. “I did the best
I could, Roran.”
“And the rest of it—Brom being a Rider, rescuing Arya at Gil’ead, and killing a Shade at the dwarves’
capital—all that happened?”
“Aye.” As quickly as he could, Eragon summarized what had taken place since he and Saphira set forth
with Brom, including their sojourn to Ellesméra and his own transformation during the Agaetí Blödhren.
Leaning forward, Roran rested his elbows on his knees, clasped his hands, and gazed at the dirt
between them. It was impossible for Eragon to read his emotions without reaching into his consciousness,
which he refused to do, knowing it would be a terrible mistake to invade Roran’s privacy.

Page 713

Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter, http://www.processtext.com/abclit.html

Roran was silent for so long, Eragon began to wonder if he would ever respond. Then: “You have made
mistakes, but they are no greater than my own. Garrow died because you kept Saphira secret. Many
more have died because I refused to give myself up to the Empire.... We are equally guilty.” He looked
up, then slowly extended his right hand. “Brother?”
“Brother,” said Eragon.
He gripped Roran’s forearm, and they pulled each other into a rough embrace, wrestling to and fro as
they used to do at home. When they separated, Eragon had to wipe his eyes with the heel of his hand.
“Galba-torix should surrender now that we’re together again,” he joked. “Who can stand against the two
of us?” He lowered himself back onto the bed-ding. “Now you tell me, how did the Ra’zac capture
Katrina?”
All happiness vanished from Roran’s face. He began to speak in a low monotone, and Eragon listened
with growing amazement as he wove an epic of attacks, sieges, and betrayal, of leaving Carvahall,
crossing the Spine, and razing the docks of Teirm, of sailing through a monstrous whirlpool.
When at last he finished, Eragon said, “You are a greater man than I. I couldn’t have done half those
things. Fight, yes, but not convince every-one to follow me.”
“I had no choice. When they took Katrina—” Roran’s voice broke. “I could either give up and die, or I
could try to escape Galbatorix’s trap, no matter the cost.” He fixed his burning eyes on Eragon. “I have
lied and burned and slaughtered to get here. I no longer have to worry about pro-tecting everyone from
Carvahall; the Varden will see to that. Now I have only one goal in life, to find and rescue Katrina, if
she’s not already dead. Will you help me, Eragon?”
Reaching over, Eragon grabbed his saddlebags from the corner of the tent—where the Varden had
deposited them—and removed a wooden bowl and the silver flask of enchanted faelnirv Oromis had
given him. He took a small sip of the liqueur to revitalize himself and gasped as it raced down his throat,
making his nerves tingle with cold fire. Then he poured faelnirv into the bowl until it formed a shallow
pool the width of his hand.
“Watch.” Gathering up his burst of new energy, Eragon said, “Draumr kópa.”
The liqueur shimmered and turned black. After a few seconds, a thin key of light appeared in the center
of the bowl, revealing Katrina. She lay slumped against an invisible wall, her hands suspended above her
with invisible manacles and her copper hair splayed like a fan across her back.
“She’s alive!” Roran hunched over the bowl, grasping at it as if he thought he could dive through the
faelnirv and join Katrina. His hope and determination melded with a look of such tender affection, Eragon
knew that only death could stop Roran from trying to free her.
Unable to sustain the spell any longer, Eragon let the image fade away. He leaned against the wall of the
tent for support. “Aye,” he said wearily, “she’s alive. And chances are, she’s imprisoned in Helgrind, in
the Ra’zac’s lair.” Eragon grasped Roran by the shoulders. “The answer to your ques-tion, brother, is
yes. I will travel to Dras-Leona with you. I will help you rescue Katrina. And then, together, you and I
shall kill the Ra’zac and avenge our father.”

PRONUNCIATION GUIDE AND GLOSSARY

ON THE ORIGIN OF NAMES:
To the casual observer, the various names an intrepid traveler will en-counter throughout Alagaësia might
seem but a random collection of la-bels with no inherent integrity, culture, or history. However, as with
any land that has been repeatedly colonized by different cultures—and in this case, different
races—Alagaësia quickly accumulated layers of names from the elves, dwarves, humans, and even
Urgals. Thus, we can have Palancar Valley (a human name), the Anora River and Ristvak’baen (elven
names), and Utgard Mountain (a dwarf name) all within a few square miles of each other.
While this is of great historical interest, practically it often leads to con-fusion as to the correct
pronunciation. Unfortunately, there are no set rules for the neophyte. Each name must be learned upon its
own terms, unless you can immediately place its language of origin. The matter grows even more
confusing when you realize that in many places the spelling and pronunciation of foreign words were
altered by the resident popula-tion to conform to their own language. The Anora River is a prime
ex-ample. Originally anora was spelled äenora, which means broad in the ancient language. In their
writings, the humans simplified the word to anora, and this, combined with a vowel shift wherein äe
(ay-eh) was said as the easier a (uh), created the name as it appears in Eragon’s time.
To spare readers as much difficulty as possible, the following list is provided, with the understanding that
these are only rough guidelines to the actual pronunciation. The enthusiast is encouraged to study the
source languages in order to master their true intricacies.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Kvetha Fricäya.
As with many authors who undertake an epic the length of the Inheri-tance trilogy, I have found that the
creation of Eragon, and now Eldest, has become my own personal quest, one that has proven every bit
as transforming as Eragon’s.
When first I conceived Eragon, I was fifteen—not quite a boy and not yet a man—just out of high
school, unsure of what path to take in life, and addicted to the potent magic of the fantasy literature that
adorned my shelves. The process of writing Eragon, marketing it across the world, and now finally
completing Eldest has swept me into adulthood. I am twenty-one now and, to my continual
astonishment, have already pub-lished two novels. Stranger things have occurred, I’m sure, but never to
me.
Eragon’s journey has been my own: plucked from a sheltered rural up-bringing and forced to rove the
land in a desperate race against time; en-during intense and arduous training; achieving success against all
expecta-tions; dealing with the consequences of fame; and eventually finding a measure of peace.
Just as in fiction when the determined and well-meaning protagonist— who really isn’t all that bright,
now is he?—is helped along his way by a host of wiser characters, so too have I been guided by a
number of stu-pendously talented people. They are:
At home: Mom, for listening whenever I need to talk about a problem with the story or characters and
for giving me the courage to throw out twelve pages and rewrite Eragon’s entrance into Ellesméra
(painful); Dad, as always, for his incisive editing; and my dear sister, Angela, for deigning to reprise her
role as a witch and for her contributions to her doppel-gänger’s dialogue.
At Writers House: my agent, the great and mighty Comma Master, Simon Lipskar, who makes all things
possible (Mervyn Peake!); and his brave assistant Daniel Lazar, who keeps the Comma Master from
being buried alive underneath a pile of unsolicited manuscripts, many of which I fear are the result of
Eragon.
At Knopf: my editor, Michelle Frey, who has gone above and beyond the call of duty in performing her
job and has made Eldest so much bet-ter than it would have been otherwise; publicity director Judith
Haut, for once again proving that no feat of promotion is beyond her reach (hear her roar!); Isabel
Warren-Lynch, art director nonpareil who, with Eldest, has exceeded her previous accomplishments;
John Jude Palencar, for a cover painting that I like even better than the one for Eragon ; copy chief Artie
Bennett, who has done a splendiferous job of checking all the ob-scure words in this trilogy and probably
knows more than I do about the ancient language, although his Urgal is a mite weak; Chip Gibson, grand
master of the children’s division at Random House; Nancy Hinkel, pub-lishing director extraordinaire;
Joan DeMayo, director of sales (much ap-plause, cheers, and bowing!) and her team; Daisy Kline, who
with her team designed the wonderful and eye-catching marketing materials; Linda Palladino, Rebecca

Price, and Timothy Terhune, production; a bow of thanks to Pam White and her team, who have helped
to spread Eragon to the four corners of the world; Melissa Nelson, design; Alison Kolani, copy editing;
Michele Burke, Michelle Frey’s dedicated, hardworking assistant; and everyone else at Knopf who has
supported me.
At Listening Library: Gerard Doyle, who brings the world of Alagaësia to life; Taro Meyer for getting the
pronunciation of my languages just right; Jacob Bronstein for pulling all the threads together; and Tim
Dit-low, publisher of Listening Library.
Thank you all.
One more volume to go and we shall reach the end of this tale. One more manuscript of heartache,
ecstasy, and perseverance.... One more co-dex of dreams.
Stay with me, if it please you, and let us see where this winding path will carry us, both in this world and
in Alagaësia.
