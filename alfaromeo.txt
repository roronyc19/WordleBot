WARNING! (Continued)
• Never leave children alone in a vehicle, or with
access to an unlocked vehicle.
• Allowing children to be in a vehicle unattended is
dangerous for a number of reasons. A child or
others could be seriously or fatally injured. Children should be warned not to touch the parking
brake, brake pedal or the transmission gear selector.
• Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle, or
in a location accessible to children. A child could

CAUTION!
An unlocked vehicle is an invitation. Always remove the key from the ignition and lock all the
doors when leaving the vehicle unattended.

Key-In-Ignition Reminder
Opening the driver’s door when the key is in the
ignition and the ignition switch position is in the STOP
(OFF/LOCK) position, sounds a signal to remove the
3
key.
SENTRY KEY
The Sentry Key Immobilizer System prevents unauthorized vehicle operation by disabling the engine. The
system does not need to be armed or activated. Operation is automatic, regardless of whether the vehicle is
locked or unlocked.
The system uses ignition keys which have an embedded
electronic chip (transponder) to prevent unauthorized
vehicle operation. Therefore, only keys that are programmed to the vehicle can be used to start and operate
the vehicle.
NOTE: A key which has not been programmed is also
considered an invalid key, even if it is cut to fit the
ignition switch lock cylinder for that vehicle.
If the vehicle security light is on after the key is turned
to the MAR/ON/RUN position, it indicates that there
is a problem with the electronics.

20 GETTING TO KNOW YOUR VEHICLE

CAUTION!
• Always remove the Sentry Key from the vehicle
and lock all doors when leaving the vehicle
unattended.
• The Sentry Key Immobilizer system is not compatible with some aftermarket remote starting
systems. Use of these systems may result in
vehicle starting problems and loss of security
protection.
All of the keys provided with your new vehicle have
been programmed to the vehicle electronics.
Replacement Keys
NOTE: Only keys that have been programmed to the
vehicle electronics can be used to start the vehicle. Once
a Sentry Key has been programmed to a vehicle, it
cannot be programmed to any other vehicle.
NOTE: When having the Sentry Key Immobilizer
System serviced, bring all vehicle keys with you to an
authorized dealer.

General Information
The following regulatory statement applies to all radio
frequency (RF) devices equipped in this vehicle:
This device complies with Part 15 of the FCC Rules and
with Industry Canada license-exempt RSS standard(s).
Operation is subject to the following two conditions:
1. This device may not cause harmful interference, and

VEHICLE SECURITY ALARM SYSTEM —
IF EQUIPPED
The Vehicle Security Alarm monitors the doors and
decklid for unauthorized entry. It will also activate the
siren and emit a visual flash of the turn signals (front
and rear) for any of the following intrusion cases.

GETTING TO KNOW YOUR VEHICLE 21

Operation

To Arm The System

The alarm activates in the following cases:
1. Wrongful opening of one of the doors or the decklid
(perimeter protection)

With the doors and decklid closed and the ignition key
either turned to STOP (OFF/LOCK) or removed, point
the key towards the vehicle then push and release the
3
lock button.

2. Wrongful operation of the ignition switch (key
turned to MAR [ON/RUN];

The system emits a visual signal and activates door
locking.

3. Cutting of the battery leads

A self-diagnosis stage lasting approximately 30 seconds
precedes the activation of the alarm. During the selfdiagnosis, the vehicle security light flashes in the instrument panel at a frequency of about one flash per second.

4. Anomalous lifting/tilting of the car
Operation of the alarm is indicated by an acoustic and
visual signal (flashing of the front and rear turn signals
for several seconds). The alarm activation modes may
vary according to the market. There is a maximum
number of acoustic/visual cycles. When this is reached
the system returns to normal operation.
NOTE:
• The engine locking function is guaranteed by the Alfa
Romeo CODE, which is automatically activated
when the key is extracted from the ignition switch.
• The alarm is adapted to meet requirements in various
countries.

After the self-diagnosis stage, the vehicle security light
flashes at a lower frequency (approximately one flash
every three seconds).
If, after the alarm is switched on, a second visual signal
emit via the vehicle security light in the instrument
panel, wait about four seconds and switch off the alarm
by pushing the lock button, check that the doors and
decklid are closed correctly and then reactivate the
system by pushing the unlock button.
If the alarm emits a visual signal even when the doors
and decklid are closed correctly, a system malfunction
has occurred: in this case, contact an authorized dealer.

22 GETTING TO KNOW YOUR VEHICLE

• With the top installed at speeds higher than 80 mph
(130 km/h), optimal comfort may not be achieved.
The top fabric is treated with a special water repellent,
waterproof product. The water-repellent properties
will degrade in time with exposure to the weather
elements. Observe the following instructions for
washing:
• Use of specific products is recommended for washing
the top.
• Bird droppings must be washed off immediately and
thoroughly as the acid they contain is particularly
aggressive.
• Never use high-pressure washing systems.
• Hand washing is recommended; modern automatic
washing systems equipped with soft brushes which
do not apply excessive pressure and employ specific
soft top products may be used.

• When using steam washers or high-pressure power
washers, maintain a suitable distance and do not
exceed a maximum temperature of 140 °F (60 °C).
Damage, alterations and water infiltrations may occur if the distance is too small.

• If a water jet is used, direct away from the edges of
the fabric to prevent water infiltrations.
• Never use alcohol, petroleum products, chemical
products, detergents, stain removers, wax, solvents,
and “wash and polish” products.
• Remove as much dirt from the surface of the top with
a soft brush or vacuum cleaner before washing it.
This operation will considerably improve the final
result. In lack of specific products, use water and
mild soap applied with a sponge preferably in the
shade for washing. Rinse the top with clean water
after having eliminated all the stains.
• Rinse immediately to remove soap to prevent stains.
• Leave the vehicle in the shade after washing avoiding direct sunlight.

• Accessories that draw higher power (i.e., coolers,
vacuum cleaners, lights, etc.) will degrade the
battery even more quickly. Only use these intermittently and with greater caution.
• After the use of high power draw accessories, or
long periods of the vehicle not being started (with

accessories still plugged in), the vehicle must be
driven a sufficient length of time to allow the
generator to recharge the vehicle’s battery.
• Do not exceed the maximum power of 180 Watts
(15 Amps) at 12 Volts. If the 180 Watts (15 Amps)
power rating is exceeded, the fuse protecting the
system will need to be replaced.
• Power outlets are designed for accessory plugs
only. Do not insert any other object in the power
outlets as this will damage the outlet and blow
the fuse. Improper use of the power outlet can
cause damage not covered by your New Vehicle
Limited Warranty.

and/or acoustic signal when applicable. These indications are indicative and precautionary and as such must

GETTING TO KNOW YOUR INSTRUMENT PANEL 75

not be considered as exhaustive. Always refer to the
information in this chapter in the event of a failure
indication. All active telltales will display first if applicable. The system check menu may appear different
based upon equipment options and current vehicle
status. Some telltales are optional and may not appear.
Red Warning Lights
— Brake Warning Light
This warning light monitors various brake functions,
including brake fluid level and parking brake application. If the brake light turns on it may indicate that the
parking brake is applied, that the brake fluid level is
low, or that there is a problem with the anti-lock brake
system reservoir.
If the light remains on when the parking brake has been
disengaged, and the fluid level is at the full mark on the
master cylinder reservoir, it indicates a possible brake
hydraulic system malfunction or that a problem with
the Brake Booster has been detected by the Anti-Lock
Brake System (ABS) / Electronic Stability Control (ESC)
system. In this case, the light will remain on until the
condition has been corrected. If the problem is related to

the brake booster, the ABS pump will run when applying the brake, and a brake pedal pulsation may be felt
during each stop.
The dual brake system provides a reserve braking
capacity in the event of a failure to a portion of the
hydraulic system. A leak in either half of the dual brake 4
system is indicated by the Brake Warning Light, which
will turn on when the brake fluid level in the master
cylinder has dropped below a specified level.
The light will remain on until the cause is corrected.
NOTE: The light may flash momentarily during sharp
cornering maneuvers, which change fluid level conditions. The vehicle should have service performed, and
the brake fluid level checked.
If brake failure is indicated, immediate repair is necessary.

WARNING!
Driving a vehicle with the red brake light on is
dangerous. Part of the brake system may have
failed. It will take longer to stop the vehicle. You
could have a collision. Have the vehicle checked
immediately.

76 GETTING TO KNOW YOUR INSTRUMENT PANEL

Vehicles equipped with the Anti-Lock Brake System
(ABS) are also equipped with Electronic Brake Force
Distribution (EBD). In the event of an EBD failure, the
Brake Warning Light will turn on along with the ABS
Light. Immediate repair to the ABS system is required.
Operation of the Brake Warning Light can be checked
by turning the ignition switch from the OFF position to
the ON/RUN position. The light should illuminate for
approximately two seconds. The light should then turn
off unless the parking brake is applied or a brake fault
is detected. If the light does not illuminate, have the
light inspected by an authorized dealer.
The light also will turn on when the parking brake is
applied with the ignition switch in the ON/RUN position.
NOTE: This light shows only that the parking brake is
applied. It does not show the degree of brake application.
— Oil Pressure Warning Light
This warning light will illuminate to indicate low
engine oil pressure. If the light turns on while driving,
stop the vehicle, shut off the engine as soon as possible,
and contact an authorized dealer. A chime will sound
when this light turns on.

Do not operate the vehicle until the cause is corrected.
This light does not indicate how much oil is in the engine.
The engine oil level must be checked under the hood.
— Electronic Throttle Control (ETC) Warning
Light
This warning light will illuminate to inform of a problem with the Electronic Throttle Control (ETC) system.
If a problem is detected while the vehicle is running, the
light will either stay on or flash depending on the
nature of the problem. Cycle the ignition when the
vehicle is safely and completely stopped and the transmission is placed in the PARK position. The light
should turn off. If the light remains on with the vehicle
running, your vehicle will usually be drivable; however,
see an authorized dealer for service as soon as possible.
If the light continues to flash when the vehicle is
running, immediate service is required and you may
experience reduced performance, an elevated/rough
idle, or engine stall and your vehicle may require
towing. The light will come on when the ignition is
placed in the ON/RUN or MAR/ON/RUN position
and remain on briefly as a bulb check. If the light does
not come on during starting, have the system checked
by an authorized dealer.

GETTING TO KNOW YOUR INSTRUMENT PANEL 77

— Air Bag Warning Light
This light will turn on for four to eight seconds as a bulb
check when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN or
MAR/ON/RUN position. If the light is either not on
during startup, stays on, or turns on while driving, have
the system inspected at an authorized dealer as soon as
possible. This light will illuminate with a single chime
when a fault with the Air Bag Warning Light has been
detected, it will stay on until the fault is cleared. If the
light comes on intermittently or remains on while
driving, have an authorized dealer service the vehicle
immediately.
— Seat Belt Reminder Warning Light
When the ignition is first placed in the ON/RUN or
MAR/ON/RUN position, if the driver’s seat belt is
unbuckled, a chime will sound and the light will turn
on. When driving, if the driver or front passenger seat
belt remains unbuckled, the Seat Belt Reminder Light

This light will illuminate (together with a message in
the instrument cluster display and a buzzer) to indicate
a transmission fault. Contact your authorized dealer if
the message remains after restarting the engine.
— Battery Charge Warning Light —
If Equipped
This light illuminates when the battery is not charging
properly. If it stays on while the engine is running, there
may be a malfunction with the charging system. Contact your authorized dealer as soon as possible. This
indicates a possible problem with the electrical system
or a related component.
— Engine Coolant Temperature Warning Light
This warning light warns of an overheated engine
condition. If the engine coolant temperature is too high,
this indicator will illuminate and a single chime will
sound. If the temperature reaches the upper limit, a
continuous chime will sound for four minutes or until
the engine is able to cool: whichever comes first.
If the light turns on while driving, safely pull over and
stop the vehicle. If the A/C system is on, turn it off.
Also, shift the transmission into NEUTRAL and idle the

vehicle. If the temperature reading does not return to
normal, turn the engine off immediately and call for
service.
Refer to “If Your Engine Overheats” in “In Case Of
Emergency” for further information.
Yellow Warning Lights
— Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)
Warning Light
The warning light switches on and a message is displayed to indicate that the tire pressure is lower than
the recommended value and/or that slow pressure loss
is occurring. In these cases, optimal tire duration and
fuel consumption may not be guaranteed.
Should one or more tires be in the condition mentioned
above, the display will show the indications corresponding to each tire.

CAUTION!
Do not continue driving with one or more flat tires
as handling may be compromised. Stop the vehicle,
(Continued)

CAUTION! (Continued)
avoiding sharp braking and steering. If a tire puncture occurs, repair immediately using the dedicated
tire repair kit and contact an authorized dealer as
soon as possible.
Each tire, including the spare (if provided), should be
checked monthly when cold and inflated to the inflation
pressure recommended by the vehicle manufacturer on
the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label. (If
your vehicle has tires of a different size than the size
indicated on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label, you should determine the proper tire inflation pressure for those tires.)
As an added safety feature, your vehicle has been
equipped with a Tire Pressure Monitoring System
(TPMS) that illuminates a low tire pressure telltale
when one or more of your tires is significantly underinflated. Accordingly, when the low tire pressure telltale
illuminates, you should stop and check your tires as
soon as possible, and inflate them to the proper pressure. Driving on a significantly under-inflated tire
causes the tire to overheat and can lead to tire failure.

GETTING TO KNOW YOUR INSTRUMENT PANEL 79

Under-inflation also reduces fuel efficiency and tire
tread life, and may affect the vehicle’s handling and
stopping ability.
Please note that the TPMS is not a substitute for proper
tire maintenance, and it is the driver’s responsibility to
maintain correct tire pressure, even if under-inflation
has not reached the level to trigger illumination of the
TPMS low tire pressure telltale.
Your vehicle has also been equipped with a TPMS
malfunction indicator to indicate when the system is
not operating properly. The TPMS malfunction indicator is combined with the low tire pressure telltale. When
the system detects a malfunction, the telltale will flash
for approximately one minute and then remain continuously illuminated. This sequence will continue upon
subsequent vehicle start-ups as long as the malfunction
exists. When the malfunction indicator is illuminated,
the system may not be able to detect or signal low tire
pressure as intended. TPMS malfunctions may occur for
a variety of reasons, including the installation of replacement or alternate tires or wheels on the vehicle
that prevent the TPMS from functioning properly. Always check the TPMS malfunction telltale after replacing one or more tires or wheels on your vehicle to

ensure that the replacement or alternate tires and
wheels allow the TPMS to continue to function properly.

CAUTION!
The TPMS has been optimized for the original
equipment tires and wheels. TPMS pressures and
warning have been established for the tire size
equipped on your vehicle. Undesirable system operation or sensor damage may result when using
replacement equipment that is not of the same size,
type, and/or style. Aftermarket wheels can cause
sensor damage. Using aftermarket tire sealants may
cause the Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)
sensor to become inoperable. After using an aftermarket tire sealant it is recommended that you take
your vehicle to your authorized dealer to have your
sensor function checked.
— Anti-Lock Brake (ABS) Warning Light
This light monitors the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS).
The light will turn on when the ignition is placed in the
ON/RUN or MAR/ON/RUN position and may stay
on for as long as four seconds.

4

80 GETTING TO KNOW YOUR INSTRUMENT PANEL

If the ABS light remains on or turns on while driving,
then the Anti-Lock portion of the brake system is not
functioning and service is required. However, the conventional brake system will continue to operate normally if the brake warning light is not on.
If the ABS light is on, the brake system should be
serviced as soon as possible to restore the benefits of
Anti-Lock Brakes. If the ABS light does not turn on
when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN or MAR/
ON/RUN position, have the light inspected by an
authorized dealer.
— Electronic Stability Control (ESC) Warning
Light — If Equipped
The “ESC Indicator Light” in the instrument cluster will
come on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN or
MAR/ON/RUN position, and when ESC is activated. It
should go out with the engine running. If the “ESC
Indicator Light” comes on continuously with the engine
running, a malfunction has been detected in the ESC
system. If this light remains on after several ignition
cycles, and the vehicle has been driven several miles
(kilometers) at speeds greater than 30 mph (48 km/h),
see your authorized dealer as soon as possible to have
the problem diagnosed and corrected.

• The “ESC Off Indicator Light” and the “ESC Indicator Light” come on momentarily each time the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN or MAR/ON/RUN
position.
• Each time the ignition is turned to ON/RUN or
MAR/ON/RUN, the ESC system will be on, even if
it was turned off previously.
• The ESC system will make buzzing or clicking
sounds when it is active. This is normal; the sounds
will stop when ESC becomes inactive.
• This light will come on when the vehicle is in an ESC
event.
— Electronic Stability Control (ESC) Off
Warning Light — If Equipped
This warning light indicates the Electronic Stability
Control (ESC) is off.
Each time the ignition is turned to ON/RUN or ACC/
ON/RUN, the ESC system will be on, even if it was
turned off previously.

— Engine Check/Malfunction Indicator
Warning Light (MIL)

WARNING!

The Engine Check/Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) is
a part of an Onboard Diagnostic System called OBD II
that monitors engine and automatic transmission control systems. This warning light will illuminate when
the ignition is in the ON/RUN position before engine
start. If the bulb does not come on when turning the
ignition switch from OFF to ON/RUN, have the condition checked promptly.

A malfunctioning catalytic converter, as referenced
above, can reach higher temperatures than in normal operating conditions. This can cause a fire if
you drive slowly or park over flammable substances such as dry plants, wood, cardboard, etc.
This could result in death or serious injury to the
driver, occupants or others.

Certain conditions, such as a loose or missing gas cap,
poor quality fuel, etc., may illuminate the light after
engine start. The vehicle should be serviced if the light
stays on through several typical driving styles. In most
situations, the vehicle will drive normally and will not
require towing.

CAUTION!

When the engine is running, the MIL may flash to alert
serious conditions that could lead to immediate loss of
power or severe catalytic converter damage. The vehicle
should be serviced by an authorized dealer as soon as
possible if this occurs.

Prolonged driving with the Malfunction Indicator
Light (MIL) on could cause damage to the vehicle
control system. It also could affect fuel economy
and driveability. If the MIL is flashing, severe
catalytic converter damage and power loss will soon
occur. Immediate service is required.
— Generic Warning Light
The Generic Warning Light will illuminate if there is an
Engine Oil Pressure Sensor Failure.

4

82 GETTING TO KNOW YOUR INSTRUMENT PANEL

— Passenger Air Bag Indicator Light
This light should come and remain on for four to eight
seconds as a bulb check when the ignition is first turned
to the AVV/START or MAR/ON/RUN position. If the
light stays on, or comes on while driving it may indicate
a problem with a passenger air bag system, if the light
flickers it may indicate an air bag warning light failure.
Have an authorized dealer service the air bag system
immediately.
Green Indicator Lights
— Turn Signal Indicator Lights
The turn signal arrows will flash independently when
left or right turn signals are selected. Turn signals can be
activated when the multifunction lever is moved down
(left) or up (right).
— Park/Headlight On Indicator Light
This indicator light will illuminate when the park lights
or headlights are turned on.

— Cruise Control Set Indicator Light —
If Equipped
This indicator light will illuminate when the cruise
control is set to the desired speed. Refer to “Speed
Control” in “Starting And Operating” for further information.
— Door Mirror Defrost Indicator Light
This indicator will illuminate when the Door Mirror
Defrost button on the instrument panel is pushed to the
on position.
Blue Indicator Lights
— High Beam Indicator Light
This indicator light will illuminate to indicate that the
high beam headlights are on. With the low beams
activated, push the multifunction lever forward (toward the front of the vehicle) to turn on the high beams.
Pull the multifunction lever rearward (toward the rear
of the vehicle) to turn off the high beams. If the high
beams are off, pull the lever toward you for a temporary
high beam on, ⬙flash to pass⬙ scenario.

GETTING TO KNOW YOUR INSTRUMENT PANEL 83

ONBOARD DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM — OBD II
Your vehicle is equipped with a sophisticated onboard
diagnostic system called OBD II. This system monitors
the performance of the emissions, engine, and Alfa
Twin Clutch Transmission control systems. When these
systems are operating properly, your vehicle will provide excellent performance and fuel economy, as well as
engine emissions well within current government regulations.
If any of these systems require service, the OBD II
system will turn on the “Malfunction Indicator Light
(MIL)”. It will also store diagnostic codes and other
information to assist your service technician in making
repairs. Although your vehicle will usually be drivable
and not need towing, see your authorized dealer for
service as soon as possible.

CAUTION! (Continued)
The vehicle must be serviced before any emissions tests can be performed.
• If the MIL is flashing while the vehicle is
running, severe catalytic converter damage and
power loss will soon occur. Immediate service is
required.
Onboard Diagnostic System (OBD II)
Cybersecurity
Your vehicle is required to have an Onboard Diagnostic
system (OBD II) and a connection port to allow access to
information related to the performance of your emissions controls. Authorized service technicians may need
to access this information to assist with the diagnosis
and service of your vehicle and emissions system.

CAUTION!

WARNING!

• Prolonged driving with the MIL on could cause
further damage to the emission control system. It
could also affect fuel economy and driveability.

• ONLY an authorized service technician should
connect equipment to the OBD II connection port
in order to read the VIN, diagnose, or service your
vehicle.

(Continued)
(Continued)

4

84 GETTING TO KNOW YOUR INSTRUMENT PANEL

WARNING! (Continued)
• If unauthorized equipment is connected to the
OBD II connection port, such as a driver-behavior
tracking device, it may:
• Be possible that vehicle systems, including
safety related systems, could be impaired or a
loss of vehicle control could occur that may
result in an accident involving serious injury or
death.
• Access, or allow others to access, information
stored in your vehicle systems, including personal information.
For further information, refer to “Cybersecurity” in the
“Multimedia” section.

EMISSIONS INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE
PROGRAMS
In some localities, it may be a legal requirement to pass
an inspection of your vehicle’s emissions control system. Failure to pass could prevent vehicle registration.
For states that require an Inspection and
Maintenance (I/M), this check verifies the
“Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL)” is functioning and is not on when the engine is
running, and that the OBD II system is ready for testing.
Normally, the OBD II system will be ready. The OBD II
system may not be ready if your vehicle was recently
serviced, recently had a dead battery or a battery
replacement. If the OBD II system should be determined not ready for the I/M test, your vehicle may fail
the test.

GETTING TO KNOW YOUR INSTRUMENT PANEL 85

Your vehicle has a simple ignition actuated test, which
you can use prior to going to the test station. To check
if your vehicle’s OBD II system is ready, you must do
the following:
1. Cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, but do
not crank or start the engine.
NOTE: If you crank or start the engine, you will have to
start this test over.
2. As soon as you cycle the ignition switch to the ON
position, you will see the “Malfunction Indicator
Light (MIL)” symbol come on as part of a normal
bulb check.
3. Approximately 15 seconds later, one of two things
will happen:
• The MIL will flash for about ten seconds and then
return to being fully illuminated until you turn OFF
the ignition or start the engine. This means that your
vehicle’s OBD II system is not ready and you should
not proceed to the I/M station.

• The MIL will not flash at all and will remain fully
illuminated until you place the ignition in the off
position or start the engine. This means that your
vehicle’s OBD II system is ready and you can proceed
to the I/M station.
If your OBD II system is not ready, you should see an 4
authorized dealer or repair facility. If your vehicle was
recently serviced or had a battery failure or replacement, you may need to do nothing more than drive
your vehicle as you normally would in order for your
OBD II system to update. A recheck with the above test
routine may then indicate that the system is now ready.
Regardless of whether your vehicle’s OBD II system is
ready or not, if the MIL is illuminated during normal
vehicle operation you should have your vehicle serviced before going to the I/M station. The I/M station
can fail your vehicle because the MIL is on with the
engine running.

SAFETY FEATURES

WARNING! (Continued)

Four-Wheel Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS)
The Four-Wheel ABS is designed to aid the driver in
maintaining vehicle control under adverse braking conditions. The system operates with a separate computer to
modulate hydraulic pressure, to prevent wheel lock-up
and to help avoid skidding on slippery surfaces.
The system’s pump motor runs during an ABS stop to
provide regulated hydraulic pressure. The pump motor
makes a low humming noise during operation, which is
normal.
The ABS includes an amber ABS Warning Light. When
the light is illuminated, the ABS is not functioning. The
system reverts to standard non-anti-lock brakes. Turning the ignition OFF and ON again may reset the ABS if
the fault detected was only momentary.

WARNING!
• When the ABS intervenes and you feel the brake
pedal pulsating, do not reduce the pressure, but
hold it down firmly and confidently; in doing so
(Continued)

you will brake in the shortest distance possible,
depending on the current road conditions.
• For maximum efficiency of the braking system, a
bedding-in period of about 311 miles (500 km) is
required: during this period it is advisable to
avoid sharp, repeated and prolonged braking.
• If the ABS intervenes, this indicates that the grip
of the tires on the road is nearing its limit: you
must slow down to a speed compatible with the
available grip.
• The ABS can’t overrule the natural laws of physics, and can’t increase the grip available according
to the condition of the road.
• The ABS cannot prevent accidents, including
those due to excessive speed on corners, driving
on low-grip surfaces or aquaplaning.
• The capability of the ABS must never be tested
irresponsibly and dangerously, in such a way as to
compromise personal safety and the safety of others.
• For the correct operation of the ABS, the tires
must of necessity be the same make and type on
all wheels, in perfect condition and, above all, of
the prescribed type and dimensions.

SAFETY

When you are in a severe braking condition involving
the use of the ABS, you will experience some pedal drop
as the vehicle comes to a stop. This is the result of the
system reverting to the base brake system.
Engagement of the ABS may be accompanied by a
pulsing sensation. You may also hear a clicking noise.
These occurrences are normal and indicate that the
system is functioning properly.
System Intervention
A slight pulsing of the brake pedal and noise indicates
the intervention of the ABS: this is completely normal
when the system intervenes.
ESC (Electronic Stability Control System)
The ESC system improves the directional control and
stability of the vehicle in various driving conditions.
The ESC system corrects the vehicle understeer and
oversteer, distributing the brake force on the appropriate wheels. The torque supplied by the engine can also
be reduced in order to maintain control of the vehicle.

89

WARNING!
• Electronic Stability Control (ESC) cannot prevent
the natural laws of physics from acting on the
vehicle, nor can it increase the traction afforded
by prevailing road conditions. ESC cannot prevent all collisions, including those resulting from
excessive speed in turns, driving on very slippery
surfaces, or hydroplaning. ESC also cannot prevent collisions resulting from loss of vehicle
control due to inappropriate driver input for the
conditions. Only a safe, attentive, and skillful
driver can prevent collisions. The capabilities of
an ESC equipped vehicle must never be exploited
in a reckless or dangerous manner which could
jeopardize the user’s safety or the safety of others.
• Vehicle modifications, or failure to properly
maintain your vehicle, may change the handling
characteristics of your vehicle, and may negatively affect the performance of the ESC system.
Changes to the steering system, suspension, braking system, tire type and size or wheel size may
adversely affect ESC performance. Improperly
(Continued)

5

90 SAFETY

WARNING! (Continued)
inflated and unevenly worn tires may also degrade ESC performance. Any vehicle modification or poor vehicle maintenance that reduces the
effectiveness of the ESC system can increase the
risk of loss of vehicle control, vehicle rollover,
personal injury and death.
The ESC system uses sensors installed on the vehicle to
determine the trajectory that the driver intends to
follow and compares it with the vehicles effective
trajectory. When the real trajectory deviates from the
desired trajectory, the ESC system intervenes to counter
the vehicles understeer or oversteer.
• Oversteer: occurs when the vehicle is turning more
than it should according to the angle of the steering
wheel.
• Understeer: occurs when the vehicle is turning less
than it should according to the angle of the steering
wheel.
This vehicle’s advanced electronic brake control system
also includes: Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD), AntiLock Brake System (ABS), Cornering Brake Control
System (CBC), Drag Torque Control System (DTC),

AntiSlip Regulation System (ASR), Hill Start Assist
(HSA), Hydraulic Brake Assistant System (HBA),
ELECTRONIC Q2 system (E-Q2) and Ready Alert Brake
(RAB). All of the systems work together to enhance
vehicle stability and control in various driving conditions, and are commonly referred to as ESC.
System Activation
The ESC system activates automatically when the engine is started and can only be deactivated by selecting
⬙Race⬙ mode. Refer to the ⬙Six-Speed Alfa Twin Clutch
Transmission⬙ in “Starting And Operating.”
System Intervention
This is indicated by the flashing of the warning light on
the instrument panel, to inform the driver that the
vehicle is in critical stability and grip conditions.
Electronic Brake Distribution System (EBD)
The EBD system is an integral part of the ESC system
and intervenes during braking, distributing the brake
force optimally between front and rear wheels.
This guarantees greater braking stability for the vehicle,
preventing sudden locking of the rear wheels and the
consequent instability of the vehicle.

SAFETY

Cornering Brake Control System (CBC)
The system acts when braking on corners, optimizing the
distribution of brake pressure on the four wheels: the
system prevents the wheels on the inside of the corner
(less affected by the weight of the vehicle) from locking,
ensuring better stability and direction for the vehicle.
Drag Torque Control System (DTC)
This is an integral part of the ESC system and intervenes in the event of sudden downshifting, or during
braking when the ABS intervenes, restoring torque to
the engine and thus preventing excessive drag at the
drive wheels, which may lead the wheels to lock and a
loss of vehicle stability, above all in low-grip conditions.
AntiSlip Regulation System (ASR)

WARNING!
• Electronic Stability Control (ESC) cannot prevent
the natural laws of physics from acting on the
vehicle, nor can it increase the traction afforded
by prevailing road conditions. ESC cannot prevent all collisions, including those resulting from
(Continued)

91

WARNING! (Continued)
excessive speed in turns, driving on very slippery
surfaces, or hydroplaning. ESC also cannot prevent collisions resulting from loss of vehicle
control due to inappropriate driver input for the
conditions. Only a safe, attentive, and skillful
driver can prevent collisions. The capabilities of
an ESC equipped vehicle must never be exploited
in a reckless or dangerous manner which could
jeopardize the user’s safety or the safety of others.
• Vehicle modifications, or failure to properly
maintain your vehicle, may change the handling
characteristics of your vehicle, and may negatively affect the performance of the ESC system.
Changes to the steering system, suspension, braking system, tire type and size or wheel size may
adversely affect ESC performance. Improperly
inflated and unevenly worn tires may also degrade ESC performance. Any vehicle modification or poor vehicle maintenance that reduces the
effectiveness of the ESC system can increase the
risk of loss of vehicle control, vehicle rollover,
personal injury and death.

5

92 SAFETY

This is an integral part of the ESC system and automatically operates in the event of one or both drive wheels
slipping, loss of grip on wet roads (hydroplaning) and
acceleration on slippery, snowy or icy roads, etc.

• Uphill: vehicle stationary on a road with a gradient
higher than 5%, engine running, brake pressed and
transmission in neutral (N) or gear other than reverse
engaged.

Depending on the slipping conditions, two different
control systems are activated:

• Downhill: vehicle stationary on a road with a gradient higher than 5%, engine running, brake pressed
and reverse (R) gear engaged.

• If the slipping involves both drive wheels, the ASR
system intervenes, reducing the power transmitted
by the engine.
• If the slipping only involves one of the drive wheels,
it also intervenes automatically, braking the wheel
that is slipping.
System Intervention
This is indicated by the flashing of the warning light on
the instrument panel, to inform the driver that the
vehicle is in critical stability and grip conditions.
Hill Start Assist (HSA)
This is an integral part of the ESC system and facilitates
starting on slopes, activating automatically in the following cases:

When setting off, the ESC system control unit maintains
the braking pressure on the wheels until the engine
torque necessary for starting is reached, or in any case
for a maximum of two seconds, allowing your right foot
to be moved easily from the brake pedal to the accelerator.
When the two seconds have elapsed, without starting,
the system is automatically deactivated, gradually releasing the braking pressure. During this release stage,
the typical brake disengagement noise, indicating that
the vehicle is going to move imminently, can be heard.
NOTE:
• HSA is not a parking brake; therefore, never leave the
vehicle without having engaged the parking brake,
turned the engine off and engaged first gear, so that
the vehicle is parked in safe conditions.

SAFETY

• There may be situations on small gradients (less than
8%), with vehicle laden, in which the Hill Holder
system may not activate, causing a slight reversing
motion and increasing the risk of collision with
another vehicle or object. The driver is, in any case,
responsible for safe driving.
Hydraulic Brake Assistant System (HBA)

WARNING!
• The HBA system can’t overrule the natural laws
of physics, and can’t increase the grip available
according to the condition of the road.
• The HBA system cannot prevent accidents, including those due to excessive speed on corners,
driving on low-grip surfaces or aquaplaning.
• The capability of the HBA system must never be
tested irresponsibly and dangerously, in such a way
as to compromise the safety of the driver, the other
occupants of the vehicle or any other road user.
The HBA system is designed to improve the vehicles
braking capacity during emergency braking. The system detects emergency braking by monitoring the
speed and force with which the brake pedal is pressed,

93

and consequently applies the optimal brake pressure.
This can reduce the braking distance, the HBA system
therefore completes the ABS.
Maximum assistance from the HBA system is obtained
pressing the brake pedal very quickly. In addition, the
brake pedal should be pressed continuously during
braking, avoiding intermittent presses, to get the most
5
out of the system.
Do not reduce pressure on the brake pedal until braking
is no longer necessary.
The HBA system is deactivated when the brake pedal is
released.
Electronic Q2 System (E-Q2)
The ⬙Electronic Q2⬙ system intervenes during acceleration on corners, braking the inner drive wheel and thus
increasing the traction of the outer wheel (which bears
more of the vehicles weight): the torque is thus distributed optimally between the drive wheels in accordance
with the driving conditions and road surface, permitting particularly effective, sporty driving.

94 SAFETY

Ready Alert Brake System (RAB)
This function activates automatically if the accelerator
pedal is released rapidly, reducing the brake pad travel
(both at front and back), with the aim of preparing the
braking system and enhancing its responsiveness, thus
reducing the stopping distance in the event of subsequent braking.
AUXILIARY DRIVING SYSTEMS
Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)
The Tire Pressure Monitor System (TPMS) will warn the
driver of a low tire pressure based on the vehicle
recommended cold tire pressure.
The tire pressure will vary with temperature by about
1 psi (7 kPa) for every 12°F (6.5°C). This means that
when the outside temperature decreases, the tire pressure will decrease. Tire pressure should always be set
based on cold inflation tire pressure. This is defined as
the tire pressure after the vehicle has not been driven
for at least three hours, or driven less than 1 mile
(1.6 km) after a three hour period. The cold tire inflation
pressure must not exceed the maximum inflation pressure molded into the tire sidewall. Refer to “Tires” in
“Servicing And Maintenance” for information on how

to properly inflate the vehicle’s tires. The tire pressure
will also increase as the vehicle is driven - this is normal
and there should be no adjustment for this increased
pressure.
The TPMS will warn the driver of a low tire pressure if
the tire pressure falls below the low pressure warning
limit for any reason, including low temperature effects,
or natural pressure loss through the tire.
The TPMS will continue to warn the driver of low tire
pressure as long as the condition exists, and will not
turn off until the tire pressure is at or above the
recommended cold placard pressure. Once the low tire
pressure warning (TPMS Warning Light) illuminates,
you must increase the tire pressure to the recommended
cold placard pressure in order for the TPMS Warning
Light to turn off. The system will automatically update
and the TPMS Warning Light will turn off once the
system receives the updated tire pressures. The vehicle
may need to be driven for up to 20 minutes above
15 mph (24 km/h) in order for the TPMS to receive this
information.
For example, your vehicle may have a recommended
cold (parked for more than three hours) placard pressure of 30 psi (207 kPa). If the ambient temperature is

SAFETY

68°F (20°C) and the measured tire pressure is 27 psi
(186 kPa), a temperature drop to 20°F (-7°C) will
decrease the tire pressure to approximately 23 psi
(158 kPa). This tire pressure is sufficiently low enough
to turn ON the TPMS Warning Light. Driving the
vehicle may cause the tire pressure to rise to approximately 27 psi (186 kPa), but the TPMS Warning Light
will still be ON. In this situation, the TPMS Warning
Light will turn OFF only after the tires are inflated to the
vehicle’s recommended cold placard pressure value.

95

CAUTION! (Continued)
After using an aftermarket tire sealant it is recommended that you take your vehicle to an authorized dealer to have your sensor function checked.
• After inspecting or adjusting the tire pressure,
always reinstall the valve stem cap. This will
prevent moisture and dirt from entering the valve
stem, which could damage the Tire Pressure
Monitoring Sensor.
NOTE:

CAUTION!
• The TPMS has been optimized for the original
equipment tires and wheels. TPMS pressures and
warnings have been established for the tire size
equipped on your vehicle. Undesirable system
operation or sensor damage may result when
using replacement equipment that is not of the
same size, type, and/or style. Aftermarket wheels
can cause sensor damage. Using aftermarket tire
sealants may cause the Tire Pressure Monitoring
System (TPMS) sensor to become inoperable.
(Continued)

• The TPMS is not intended to replace normal tire care
and maintenance, or to provide warning of a tire
failure or condition.
• The TPMS should not be used as a tire pressure
gauge while adjusting your tire pressure.
• Driving on a significantly under-inflated tire causes
the tire to overheat and can lead to tire failure.
Under-inflation also reduces fuel efficiency and tire
tread life, and may affect the vehicle’s handling and
stopping ability.
• The TPMS is not a substitute for proper tire maintenance, and it is the driver’s responsibility to maintain

5

96 SAFETY

correct tire pressure using an accurate tire gauge,
even if under-inflation has not reached the level to
trigger illumination of the TPMS Warning Light.
• Seasonal temperature changes will affect tire pressure, and the TPMS will monitor the actual tire
pressure in the tire.
Base System
This is the TPMS warning indicator located in
the instrument cluster.
The TPMS uses wireless technology with
wheel rim mounted electronic sensors to monitor tire
pressure levels. Sensors, mounted to each wheel as part
of the valve stem, transmit tire pressure readings to the
Receiver Module.
NOTE: It is particularly important for you to check the
tire pressure in all of the tires on your vehicle regularly
and to maintain the proper pressure.

The TPMS consists of the following components:
• Receiver Module.
• Four Tire Pressure Monitoring Sensors.
• Tire Pressure Monitoring System Warning Light.
Tire Pressure Monitoring Low Pressure Warnings
The TPMS Warning Light will illuminate in the instrument cluster, an acoustic signal will be activated, and
the “Check left or right front/rear tire” text message
will display when one or more of the four active road
tire pressures are low. Should this occur, you should
stop as soon as possible, check the inflation pressure of
each tire on your vehicle, and inflate each tire to the
vehicle’s recommended cold placard pressure value.
The system will automatically update and the Tire
Pressure Monitoring Light will extinguish once the
updated tire pressures have been received. The vehicle
may need to be driven for up to 20 minutes above
15 mph (24 km/h) to receive this information.

SAFETY

Check TPMS Warnings
The TPMS Warning Light will flash on and off for 75
seconds and remain on solid when a system fault is
detected, the “TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING UNAVAILABLE” text message will display. If the ignition
key is cycled, this sequence will repeat providing the
system fault still exists. The TPMS Warning Light will
turn off when the fault condition no longer exists. A
system fault can occur with any of the following
scenarios:
1. Jamming due to electronic devices or driving next to
facilities emitting the same radio frequencies as the
TPM sensors.
2. Installing some form of aftermarket window tinting
that affects radio wave signals.
3. Snow or ice around the wheels or wheel housings.
4. Using tire chains on the vehicle.
5. Using wheels/tires not equipped with TPM sensors.
NOTE: Your vehicle may be equipped with a compact
spare wheel and tire assembly.

1. The compact spare tire does not have a tire pressure
monitoring sensor. Therefore, the TPMS will not
monitor the tire pressure in the compact spare tire.
2. If you install the compact spare tire in place of a road
tire that has a pressure below the low-pressure
warning limit, upon the next ignition key cycle, a
chime will sound and the TPMS Warning Light will
5
still turn ON due to the low tire.
3. However, after driving the vehicle for up to 20
minutes above 15 mph (24 km/h), the TPMS Warning Light will flash on and off for 75 seconds and
then remain on solid.
4. This occurs for each subsequent ignition key cycle, a
chime will sound and the TPMS Warning Light will
flash on and off for 75 seconds and then remain on
solid.
5. Once you repair or replace the original road tire and
reinstall it on the vehicle in place of the compact
spare tire, the TPMS will update automatically and
the TPMS Warning Light will turn OFF, as long as no
tire pressure is below the low-pressure warning limit
in any of the four active road tires. The vehicle may

OCCUPANT RESTRAINT SYSTEMS
Some of the most important safety features in your
vehicle are the restraint systems:
Occupant Restraint Systems Features
• Seat Belt Systems
• Supplemental Restraint Systems (SRS) Air Bags
• Child Restraints

Some of the safety features described in this section
may be standard equipment on some models, or may be
optional equipment on others. If you are not sure, ask
an authorized dealer.
Important Safety Precautions
Please pay close attention to the information in this
section. It tells you how to use your restraint system
properly, to keep you and your passengers as safe as
possible.
Here are some simple steps you can take to minimize
the risk of harm from a deploying air bag:
1. Children 12 years old and under should always ride
buckled up in the rear seat of a vehicle with a rear
seat.
2. A child who is not big enough to wear the vehicle
seat belt properly (Refer to “Child Restraints” in this
section for further information) must be secured in
the appropriate child restraint or belt-positioning
booster seat in a rear seating position.
3. If a child from 2 to 12 years old (not in a rear-facing
child restraint) must ride in the front passenger seat,

SAFETY

move the seat as far back as possible and use the
proper child restraint (Refer to “Child Restraints” in
this section for further information).
4. Never allow children to slide the shoulder belt
behind them or under their arm.
5. You should read the instructions provided with your
child restraint to make sure that you are using it
properly.
6. All occupants should always wear their lap and
shoulder belts properly.
7. The driver and front passenger seats should be
moved back as far as practical to allow the front air
bags room to inflate.
8. Do not lean against the door or window. If your
vehicle has side air bags, and deployment occurs, the
side air bags will inflate forcefully into the space
between occupants and the door and occupants
could be injured.
9. If the air bag system in this vehicle needs to be
modified to accommodate a disabled person, refer to
the “Customer Assistance” section for customer service contact information.

99

WARNING!
• Never place a rear-facing child restraint in front of
an air bag. A deploying passenger front air bag
can cause death or serious injury to a child 12
years or younger, including a child in a rearfacing child restraint.
• Never install a rear-facing child restraint in the
front seat of a vehicle. Only use a rear-facing child
restraint in the rear seat. If the vehicle does not
have a rear seat, do not transport a rear-facing
child restraint in that vehicle.
Seat Belt Systems
Buckle up even though you are an excellent driver, even
on short trips. Someone on the road may be a poor
driver and could cause a collision that includes you.
This can happen far away from home or on your own
street.
Research has shown that seat belts save lives, and they
can reduce the seriousness of injuries in a collision.
Some of the worst injuries happen when people are
thrown from the vehicle. Seat belts reduce the possibility of ejection and the risk of injury caused by striking

5

100 SAFETY

the inside of the vehicle. Everyone in a motor vehicle
should be belted at all times.
Enhanced Seat Belt Use Reminder System
(BeltAlert)
Driver and Passenger BeltAlert — If Equipped
BeltAlert is a feature intended to remind the
driver and outboard front seat passenger (if
equipped with outboard front passenger seat
BeltAlert) to buckle their seat belts. The Belt Alert
feature is active whenever the ignition switch is in
the AVV/START or MAR/RUN position.
Initial Indication
If the driver is unbuckled when the ignition switch is
first in the AVV/START or MAR/RUN position, a
chime will signal for a few seconds. If the driver or
outboard front seat passenger (if equipped with outboard front passenger seat BeltAlert) is unbuckled
when the ignition switch is first in the AVV/START or
MAR/RUN position the Seat Belt Reminder Light will
turn on and remain on until both outboard front seat
belts are buckled. The outboard front passenger seat
BeltAlert is not active when an outboard front passenger seat is unoccupied.

BeltAlert Warning Sequence
The BeltAlert warning sequence is activated when the
vehicle is moving above a specified vehicle speed range
and the driver or outboard front seat passenger is
unbuckled (if equipped with outboard front passenger
seat BeltAlert) (the outboard front passenger seat
BeltAlert is not active when the outboard front passenger seat is unoccupied). The BeltAlert warning sequence starts by blinking the Seat Belt Reminder Light
and sounding an intermittent chime. Once the BeltAlert
warning sequence has completed, the Seat Belt Reminder Light will remain on until the seat belts are
buckled. The BeltAlert warning sequence may repeat
based on vehicle speed until the driver and occupied
outboard front seat passenger seat belts are buckled.
The driver should instruct all occupants to buckle their
seat belts.
Change of Status
If the driver or outboard front seat passenger (if
equipped with outboard front passenger seat BeltAlert)
unbuckles their seat belt while the vehicle is traveling,
the BeltAlert warning sequence will begin until the seat
belts are buckled again.

SAFETY

The outboard front passenger seat BeltAlert is not active
when the outboard front passenger seat is unoccupied.
BeltAlert may be triggered when an animal or other
items are placed on the outboard front passenger seat or
when the seat is folded flat (if equipped). It is recommended that pets be restrained in the rear seat (if
equipped) in pet harnesses or pet carriers that are
secured by seat belts, and cargo is properly stowed.
BeltAlert can be activated or deactivated by an authorized dealer. FCA US LLC does not recommend deactivating BeltAlert.
NOTE: If BeltAlert has been deactivated and the driver
or outboard front seat passenger (if equipped with
outboard front passenger seat BeltAlert) is unbuckled
the Seat Belt Reminder Light will turn on and remain on
until the driver and outboard front seat passenger seat
belts are buckled.
Lap/Shoulder Belts
All seating positions in your vehicle are equipped with
lap/shoulder belts.
The seat belt webbing retractor will lock only during
very sudden stops or collisions. This feature allows the
shoulder part of the seat belt to move freely with you

101

under normal conditions. However, in a collision the
seat belt will lock and reduce your risk of striking the
inside of the vehicle or being thrown out of the vehicle.

WARNING!
• Relying on the air bags alone could lead to more
severe injuries in a collision. The air bags work
with your seat belt to restrain you properly. In some
collisions, the air bags won’t deploy at all. Always
wear your seat belt even though you have air bags.
• In a collision, you and your passengers can suffer
much greater injuries if you are not properly
buckled up. You can strike the interior of your
vehicle or other passengers, or you can be thrown
out of the vehicle. Always be sure you and others
in your vehicle are buckled up properly.
• It is dangerous to ride in a cargo area, inside or
outside of a vehicle. In a collision, people riding
in these areas are more likely to be seriously
injured or killed.
• Do not allow people to ride in any area of your
vehicle that is not equipped with seats and seat
belts.

WARNING! (Continued)

WARNING! (Continued)

• Be sure everyone in your vehicle is in a seat and
using a seat belt properly. Occupants, including
the driver, should always wear their seat belts
whether or not an air bag is also provided at their
seating position to minimize the risk of severe
injury or death in the event of a crash.
• Wearing your seat belt incorrectly could make
your injuries in a collision much worse. You
might suffer internal injuries, or you could even
slide out of the seat belt. Follow these instructions
to wear your seat belt safely and to keep your
passengers safe, too.
• Two people should never be belted into a single
seat belt. People belted together can crash into one
another in a collision, hurting one another badly.
Never use a lap/shoulder belt or a lap belt for more
than one person, no matter what their size.

• A lap belt worn too high can increase the risk of
injury in a collision. The seat belt forces won’t be

at the strong hip and pelvic bones, but across your
abdomen. Always wear the lap part of your seat
belt as low as possible and keep it snug.
• A twisted seat belt may not protect you properly.
In a collision, it could even cut into you. Be sure
the seat belt is flat against your body, without
twists. If you can’t straighten a seat belt in your
vehicle, take it to an authorized dealer immediately and have it fixed.
• A seat belt that is buckled into the wrong buckle
will not protect you properly. The lap portion
could ride too high on your body, possibly causing internal injuries. Always buckle your seat belt
into the buckle nearest you.
• A seat belt that is too loose will not protect you
properly. In a sudden stop, you could move too far
forward, increasing the possibility of injury. Wear
your seat belt snugly.
• A seat belt that is worn under your arm is dangerous. Your body could strike the inside surfaces
of the vehicle in a collision, increasing head and
neck injury. A seat belt worn under the arm can

(Continued)

WARNING!

SAFETY

WARNING! (Continued)
cause internal injuries. Ribs aren’t as strong as
shoulder bones. Wear the seat belt over your
shoulder so that your strongest bones will take
the force in a collision.
• A shoulder belt placed behind you will not protect you from injury during a collision. You are
more likely to hit your head in a collision if you
do not wear your shoulder belt. The lap and
shoulder belt are meant to be used together.
• A frayed or torn seat belt could rip apart in a
collision and leave you with no protection. Inspect the seat belt system periodically, checking
for cuts, frays, or loose parts. Damaged parts must
be replaced immediately. Do not disassemble or
modify the seat belt system. Seat belt assemblies
must be replaced after a collision.

103

Lap/Shoulder Belt Operating Instructions
1. Enter the vehicle and close the door. Sit back and
adjust the seat.
2. The seat belt latch plate is above the back of the front
seat, and next to your arm in the rear seat (for
vehicles equipped with a rear seat). Grasp the latch
plate and pull out the seat belt. Slide the latch plate 5
up the webbing as far as necessary to allow the seat
belt to go around your lap.

Pulling Out The Latch Plate

3. When the seat belt is long enough to fit, insert the
latch plate into the buckle until you hear a “click.”

104 SAFETY

Inserting Latch Plate Into Buckle

Positioning The Lap Belt

4. Position the lap belt so that it is snug and lies low
across your hips, below your abdomen. To remove
slack in the lap belt portion, pull up on the shoulder
belt. To loosen the lap belt if it is too tight, tilt the
latch plate and pull on the lap belt. A snug seat belt
reduces the risk of sliding under the seat belt in a
collision.

5. Position the shoulder belt across the shoulder and
chest with minimal, if any slack so that it is comfortable and not resting on your neck. The retractor will
withdraw any slack in the shoulder belt.
6. To release the seat belt, push the red button on the
buckle. The seat belt will automatically retract to its
stowed position. If necessary, slide the latch plate
down the webbing to allow the seat belt to retract
fully.

SAFETY

Lap/Shoulder Belt Untwisting Procedure

105

Seat Belts And Pregnant Women

Use the following procedure to untwist a twisted lap/
shoulder belt.
1. Position the latch plate as close as possible to the
anchor point.
2. At about 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) above the latch
plate, grasp and twist the seat belt webbing 180
degrees to create a fold that begins immediately
above the latch plate.
3. Slide the latch plate upward over the folded webbing. The folded webbing must enter the slot at the
top of the latch plate.
4. Continue to slide the latch plate up until it clears the
folded webbing and the seat belt is no longer
twisted.

5

Pregnant Women And Seat Belts

Seat belts must be worn by all occupants including
pregnant women: the risk of injury in the event of an
accident is reduced for the mother and the unborn child
if they are wearing a seat belt.
Position the lap belt snug and low below the abdomen
and across the strong bones of the hips. Place the
shoulder belt across the chest and away from the neck.
Never place the shoulder belt behind the back or under
the arm.

106 SAFETY

Seat Belt Pretensioner

Switchable Automatic Locking Retractor (ALR)

The front outboard seat belt system is equipped with
pretensioning devices that are designed to remove slack
from the seat belt in the event of a collision. These
devices may improve the performance of the seat belt
by removing slack from the seat belt early in a collision.
Pretensioners work for all size occupants, including
those in child restraints.

The seat belt in the passenger seating position is
equipped with a Switchable Automatic Locking Retractor (ALR) which is used to secure a child restraint
system. For additional information, refer to “Installing
Child Restraints Using The Vehicle Seat Belt” under the
“Child Restraints” section of this manual. The figure
below illustrates the locking feature for each seating
position.

NOTE: These devices are not a substitute for proper
seat belt placement by the occupant. The seat belt still
must be worn snugly and positioned properly.
The pretensioners are triggered by the Occupant Restraint Controller (ORC). Like the air bags, the pretensioners are single use items. A deployed pretensioner or
a deployed air bag must be replaced immediately.
Energy Management Feature
The front outboard seat belt system is equipped with an
Energy Management feature that may help further
reduce the risk of injury in the event of a collision. The
seat belt system has a retractor assembly that is designed to release webbing in a controlled manner.

ALR — Switchable Automatic Locking Retractor

SAFETY

If the passenger seating position is equipped with an
ALR and is being used for normal usage, only pull the
seat belt webbing out far enough to comfortably wrap
around the occupant’s mid-section so as to not activate
the ALR. If the ALR is activated, you will hear a clicking
sound as the seat belt retracts. Allow the webbing to
retract completely in this case and then carefully pull
out only the amount of webbing necessary to comfortably wrap around the occupant’s mid-section. Slide the
latch plate into the buckle until you hear a ⬙click.⬙
In Automatic Locking Mode, the shoulder belt is automatically pre-locked. The seat belt will still retract to
remove any slack in the shoulder belt. Use the Automatic Locking Mode anytime a child restraint is installed in a seating position that has a seat belt with this
feature. Children 12 years old and under should always
be properly restrained in the rear seat of a vehicle with
a rear seat.

• Never install a rear-facing child restraint in the
front seat of a vehicle. Only use a rear-facing child
restraint in the rear seat. If the vehicle does not
have a rear seat, do not transport a rear-facing
child restraint in that vehicle.
How To Engage The Automatic Locking Mode
1. Buckle the combination lap and shoulder belt.
2. Grasp the shoulder portion and pull downward until
the entire seat belt is extracted.
3. Allow the seat belt to retract. As the seat belt retracts,
you will hear a clicking sound. This indicates the seat
belt is now in the Automatic Locking Mode.

Air Bag Warning Light
The ORC monitors the readiness of the electronic parts
of the air bag system whenever the ignition
switch is in the AVV/START or MAR/ACC/
ON/RUN position. If the ignition switch is in
the STOP/OFF/LOCK position the air bag
system is not on and the air bags will not inflate.
The ORC contains a backup power supply system that
may deploy the air bag system even if the battery loses
power or it becomes disconnected prior to deployment.
The ORC turns on the Air Bag Warning Light in the
instrument panel for approximately four to eight seconds for a self-check when the ignition switch is in the
MAR/ACC/ON/RUN position. After the self-check,
the Air Bag Warning Light will turn off. If the ORC
detects a malfunction in any part of the system, it turns
on the Air Bag Warning Light, either momentarily or
continuously. A single chime will sound to alert you if
the light comes on again after initial startup.
The ORC also includes diagnostics that will illuminate
the instrument panel Air Bag Warning Light if a malfunction is detected that could affect the air bag system.

109

The diagnostics also record the nature of the malfunction. While the air bag system is designed to be maintenance free, if any of the following occurs, have an
authorized dealer service the air bag system
immediately.
• The Air Bag Warning Light does not come on during
the four to eight seconds when the ignition switch is
first in the MAR/ACC/ON/RUN position.

• The Air Bag Warning Light remains on after the four
to eight-second interval.
• The Air Bag Warning Light comes on intermittently
or remains on while driving.
NOTE: If the speedometer, tachometer, or any engine
related gauges are not working, the Occupant Restraint
Controller (ORC) may also be disabled. In this condition the air bags may not be ready to inflate for your
protection. Have an authorized dealer service the air
bag system immediately.

110 SAFETY

WARNING!
Ignoring the Air Bag Warning Light in your instrument panel could mean you won’t have the air bag
system to protect you in a collision. If the light does
not come on as a bulb check when the ignition is
first turned on, stays on after you start the vehicle,
or if it comes on as you drive, have an authorized
dealer service the air bag system immediately.
Front Air Bags
This vehicle has front air bags and lap/shoulder belts
for both the driver and front passenger. The front air
bags are a supplement to the seat belt restraint systems.
The driver front air bag is mounted in the center of the
steering wheel. The passenger front air bag is mounted
in the instrument panel, above the glove compartment.
The words “SRS AIRBAG” or “AIRBAG” are embossed
on the air bag covers.

can cause death or serious injury to a child 12
years or younger, including a child in a rearfacing child restraint.
• Never install a rear-facing child restraint in the
front seat of a vehicle. Only use a rear-facing child
restraint in the rear seat. If the vehicle does not
have a rear seat, do not transport a rear-facing
child restraint in that vehicle.
Driver And Passenger Front Air Bag Features
The Advanced Front Air Bag system has multistage
driver and front passenger air bags. This system provides output appropriate to the severity and type of
collision as determined by the Occupant Restraint Controller (ORC), which may receive information from the
front impact sensors (if equipped) or other system
components.
The first stage inflator is triggered immediately during
an impact that requires air bag deployment. A low

111

energy output is used in less severe collisions. A higher
energy output is used for more severe collisions.
This vehicle may be equipped with a driver and/or
front passenger seat belt buckle switch that detects
whether the driver or front passenger seat belt is
buckled. The seat belt buckle switch may adjust the
inflation rate of the Advanced Front Air Bags.
This vehicle may be equipped with driver and/or front
passenger seat track position sensors that may adjust
the inflation rate of the Advanced Front Air Bags based
upon seat position.

WARNING!
• No objects should be placed over or near the air
bag on the instrument panel or steering wheel
because any such objects could cause harm if the
vehicle is in a collision severe enough to cause the
air bag to inflate.
• Do not put anything on or around the air bag
covers or attempt to open them manually. You
may damage the air bags and you could be
injured because the air bags may no longer be

WARNING! (Continued)
functional. The protective covers for the air bag
cushions are designed to open only when the air
bags are inflating.
• Relying on the air bags alone could lead to more
severe injuries in a collision. The air bags work
with your seat belt to restrain you properly. In
some collisions, air bags won’t deploy at all.
Always wear your seat belts even though you
have air bags.
Front Air Bag Operation
Front Air Bags are designed to provide additional
protection by supplementing the seat belts. Front air
bags are not expected to reduce the risk of injury in rear,
side, or rollover collisions. The front air bags will not
deploy in all frontal collisions, including some that may
produce substantial vehicle damage — for example,
some pole collisions, truck underrides, and angle offset
collisions.
On the other hand, depending on the type and location
of impact, front air bags may deploy in crashes with
little vehicle front-end damage but that produce a
severe initial deceleration.

Because air bag sensors measure vehicle deceleration
over time, vehicle speed and damage by themselves are
not good indicators of whether or not an air bag should
have deployed.
Seat belts are necessary for your protection in all
collisions, and also are needed to help keep you in
position, away from an inflating air bag.
When the ORC detects a collision requiring the front air
bags, it signals the inflator units. A large quantity of
non-toxic gas is generated to inflate the front air bags.
The steering wheel hub trim cover and the upper
passenger side of the instrument panel separate and
fold out of the way as the air bags inflate to their full
size. The front air bags fully inflate in less time than it
takes to blink your eyes. The front air bags then quickly
deflate while helping to restrain the driver and front
passenger.
Knee Impact Bolsters
The Knee Impact Bolsters help protect the knees of the
driver and front passenger, and position the front
occupants for improved interaction with the front air
bags.

SAFETY

WARNING!
• Do not drill, cut, or tamper with the knee impact
bolsters in any way.
• Do not mount any accessories to the knee impact
bolsters such as alarm lights, stereos, citizen band
radios, etc.
Supplemental Driver Knee Air Bag
This vehicle is equipped with a Supplemental Driver
Knee Air Bag mounted in the instrument panel below
the steering column. The Supplemental Driver Knee Air
Bag provides enhanced protection during a frontal
impact by working together with the seat belts, pretensioners, and front air bags.
Supplemental Side Air Bags
Supplemental Door-Integrated Side Air Bag Inflatable Curtains (SABICs)
This vehicle is equipped with Supplemental DoorIntegrated Side Air Bag Inflatable Curtains (SABICs).

113

SABICs may help reduce the risk of head and other
injuries to front seat outboard occupants in certain side
impacts, in addition to the injury reduction potential
provided by the seat belts and body structure.
The SABICs are located in the door trim below the side
windows. The trim covering the SABICs is labeled “SRS
AIRBAG” or “AIRBAG.”
The SABICs deploy upward, covering the side windows. An inflating SABIC pushes the outside edge of
the trim out of the way and covers the window. The
SABICs inflate with enough force to injure occupants if
they are not belted and seated properly, or if items are
positioned in the area where the SABICs inflate. Children are at an even greater risk of injury from a
deploying air bag.
The SABICs may help reduce the risk of partial or
complete ejection of vehicle occupants through side
windows in certain side impact events.

114 SAFETY

Supplemental Door-Integrated Side Air Bag Inflatable
Curtains (SABICs) Location

WARNING!
Do not mount equipment, or stack luggage or other
cargo up high enough to block the deployment of
the SABICs. The door trim below the side windows
where the SABIC and its deployment path are
located should remain free from any obstructions.
Side Impacts
The Side Air Bags are designed to activate in certain
side impacts. The Occupant Restraint Controller (ORC)

determines whether the deployment of the Side Air
Bags in a particular impact event is appropriate, based
on the severity and type of collision. The side impact
sensors aid the ORC in determining the appropriate
response to impact events. The system is calibrated to
deploy the Side Air Bags on the impact side of the
vehicle during impacts that require Side Air Bag occupant protection. In side impacts, the Side Air Bags
deploy independently; a left side impact deploys the
left Side Air Bags only and a right-side impact deploys
the right Side Air Bags only. Vehicle damage by itself is
not a good indicator of whether or not Side Air Bags
should have deployed.
The Side Air Bags will not deploy in all side collisions,
including some collisions at certain angles, or some side
collisions that do not impact the area of the passenger
compartment. The Side Air Bags may deploy during
angled or offset frontal collisions where the front air
bags deploy.
Side Air Bags are a supplement to the seat belt restraint
system. Side Air Bags deploy in less time than it takes to
blink your eyes.

WARNING!

WARNING! (Continued)

• Occupants, including children, who are up
against or very close to Side Air Bags can be
seriously injured or killed. Occupants, including
children, should never lean on or sleep against
the door, side windows, or area where the side air
bags inflate, even if they are in an infant or child
restraint.
• Seat belts (and child restraints where appropriate)
are necessary for your protection in all collisions.
They also help keep you in position, away from
an inflating Side Air Bag. To get the best protection from the Side Air Bags, occupants must wear
their seat belts properly and sit upright with their
backs against the seats. Children must be properly restrained in a child restraint or booster seat
that is appropriate for the size of the child.

• Being too close to the Side Air Bags during
deployment could cause you to be severely injured or killed.
• Relying on the Side Air Bags alone could lead to
more severe injuries in a collision. The Side Air
Bags work with your seat belt to restrain you
properly. In some collisions, Side Air Bags won’t
deploy at all. Always wear your seat belt even
though you have Side Air Bags.

WARNING!
• Side Air Bags need room to inflate. Do not lean
against the door or window. Sit upright in the
center of the seat.

If A Deployment Occurs
The front air bags are designed to deflate immediately
after deployment.
NOTE: Front and/or side air bags will not deploy in all
collisions. This does not mean something is wrong with
the air bag system.
If you do have a collision which deploys the air bags,
any or all of the following may occur:
• The air bag material may sometimes cause abrasions
and/or skin reddening to the occupants as the air
bags deploy and unfold. The abrasions are similar to

friction rope burns or those you might get sliding
along a carpet or gymnasium floor. They are not
caused by contact with chemicals. They are not
permanent and normally heal quickly. However, if
you haven’t healed significantly within a few days,
or if you have any blistering, see your doctor immediately.
• As the air bags deflate, you may see some smoke-like
particles. The particles are a normal by-product of the
process that generates the non-toxic gas used for air
bag inflation. These airborne particles may irritate
the skin, eyes, nose, or throat. If you have skin or eye
irritation, rinse the area with cool water. For nose or
throat irritation, move to fresh air. If the irritation
continues, see your doctor. If these particles settle on
your clothing, follow the garment manufacturer’s
instructions for cleaning.
Do not drive your vehicle after the air bags have
deployed. If you are involved in another collision, the
air bags will not be in place to protect you.

SAFETY

WARNING!
Deployed air bags and seat belt pretensioners cannot protect you in another collision. Have the air
bags, seat belt pretensioners, and the seat belt
retractor assemblies replaced by an authorized
dealer immediately. Also, have the Occupant Restraint Controller System serviced as well.
NOTE:
• Air bag covers may not be obvious in the interior
trim, but they will open during air bag deployment.
• After any collision, the vehicle should be taken to an
authorized dealer immediately.
Enhanced Accident Response System
In the event of an impact, if the communication network remains intact, and the power remains intact,
depending on the nature of the event, the ORC will
determine whether to have the Enhanced Accident
Response System perform the following functions:
• Cut off fuel to the engine (If Equipped)
• Cut off battery power to the electric motor (If
Equipped)

Maintaining Your Air Bag System

WARNING!
• Modifications to any part of the air bag system
could cause it to fail when you need it. You could
be injured if the air bag system is not there to
protect you. Do not modify the components or
wiring, including adding any kind of badges or
stickers to the steering wheel hub trim cover or
(Continued)

WARNING! (Continued)
the upper passenger side of the instrument panel.
Do not modify the front bumper, vehicle body
structure, or add aftermarket side steps or running boards.
• It is dangerous to try to repair any part of the air
bag system yourself. Be sure to tell anyone who
works on your vehicle that it has an air bag
system.
• Do not attempt to modify any part of your air bag
system. The air bag may inflate accidentally or
may not function properly if modifications are
made. Take your vehicle to an authorized dealer
for any air bag system service. If your seat,
including your trim cover and cushion, needs to
be serviced in any way (including removal or
loosening/tightening of seat attachment bolts),
take the vehicle to an authorized dealer. Only
manufacturer approved seat accessories may be
used. If it is necessary to modify the air bag
system for persons with disabilities, contact an
authorized dealer.

Event Data Recorder (EDR)
This vehicle is equipped with an event data recorder
(EDR). The main purpose of an EDR is to record, in
certain crash or near crash-like situations, such as an air
bag deployment or hitting a road obstacle, data that will
assist in understanding how a vehicle’s systems performed. The EDR is designed to record data related to
vehicle dynamics and safety systems for a short period
of time, typically 30 seconds or less. The EDR in this
vehicle is designed to record such data as:
• How various systems in your vehicle were operating;
• Whether or not the driver and passenger safety belts
were buckled/fastened;
• How far (if at all) the driver was depressing the
accelerator and/or brake pedal; and,
• How fast the vehicle was traveling.
These data can help provide a better understanding of
the circumstances in which crashes and injuries occur.

SAFETY

NOTE: EDR data are recorded by your vehicle only if a
non-trivial crash situation occurs; no data are recorded
by the EDR under normal driving conditions and no
personal data (e.g., name, gender, age, and crash location) are recorded. However, other parties, such as law
enforcement, could combine the EDR data with the type
of personally identifying data routinely acquired during a crash investigation.
To read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is
required, and access to the vehicle or the EDR is needed.
In addition to the vehicle manufacturer, other parties,
such as law enforcement, that have the special equipment, can read the information if they have access to the
vehicle or the EDR.
Child Restraints
Everyone in your vehicle needs to be buckled up at all
times, including babies and children. Every state in the
United States, and every Canadian province, requires
that small children ride in proper restraint systems. This
is the law, and you can be prosecuted for ignoring it.
Children 12 years or younger should ride properly
buckled up in a rear seat, if available. According to

121

crash statistics, children are safer when properly restrained in the rear seats rather than in the front.

WARNING!
In a collision, an unrestrained child can become a
projectile inside the vehicle. The force required to
hold even an infant on your lap could become so
great that you could not hold the child, no matter
how strong you are. The child and others could be
badly injured or killed. Any child riding in your
vehicle should be in a proper restraint for the
child’s size.
There are different sizes and types of restraints for
children from newborn size to the child almost large
enough for an adult safety belt. Always check the child
seat Owner’s Manual to make sure you have the correct
seat for your child. Carefully read and follow all the
instructions and warnings in the child restraint Owner’s Manual and on all the labels attached to the child
restraint.
Before buying any restraint system, make sure that it
has a label certifying that it meets all applicable Safety
Standards. You should also make sure that you can
install it in the vehicle where you will use it.

SAFETY

Infant And Child Restraints
Safety experts recommend that children ride rear-facing
in the vehicle until they are two years old or until they
reach either the height or weight limit of their rear-facing
child restraint. Two types of child restraints can be used
rear-facing: infant carriers and convertible child seats.
The infant carrier is only used rear-facing in the vehicle.
It is recommended for children from birth until they
reach the weight or height limit of the infant carrier.
Convertible child seats can be used either rear-facing or
forward-facing in the vehicle. Convertible child seats
often have a higher weight limit in the rear-facing
direction than infant carriers do, so they can be used
rear-facing by children who have outgrown their infant
carrier but are still less than at least two years old.
Children should remain rear-facing until they reach the
highest weight or height allowed by their convertible
child seat.

WARNING!
• Never place a rear-facing child restraint in front of
an air bag. A deploying passenger front air bag
(Continued)

123

WARNING! (Continued)
can cause death or serious injury to a child 12
years or younger, including a child in a rearfacing child restraint.
• Never install a rear-facing child restraint in the
front seat of a vehicle. Only use a rear-facing child
restraint in the rear seat. If the vehicle does not
have a rear seat, do not transport a rear-facing
child restraint in that vehicle.
Older Children And Child Restraints
Children who are two years old or who have outgrown
their rear-facing convertible child seat can ride forwardfacing in the vehicle. Forward-facing child seats and
convertible child seats used in the forward-facing direction are for children who are over two years old or who
have outgrown the rear-facing weight or height limit of
their rear-facing convertible child seat. Children should
remain in a forward-facing child seat with a harness for
as long as possible, up to the highest weight or height
allowed by the child seat.
All children whose weight or height is above the
forward-facing limit for the child seat should use a
belt-positioning booster seat until the vehicle’s seat

belts fit properly. If the child cannot sit with knees bent
over the vehicle’s seat cushion while the child’s back is
against the seatback, they should use a belt-positioning
booster seat. The child and belt-positioning booster seat
are held in the vehicle by the seat belt.

it loose in the vehicle. In a sudden stop or
accident, it could strike the occupants or seatbacks and cause serious personal injury.
Children Too Large For Booster Seats

WARNING!
• Improper installation can lead to failure of an
infant or child restraint. It could come loose in a
collision. The child could be badly injured or
killed. Follow the child restraint manufacturer’s
directions exactly when installing an infant or
child restraint.
• After a child restraint is installed in the vehicle,
do not move the vehicle seat forward or rearward
because it can loosen the child restraint attachments. Remove the child restraint before adjusting the vehicle seat position. When the vehicle
seat has been adjusted, reinstall the child restraint.
• When your child restraint is not in use, secure it
in the vehicle with the seat belt or LATCH anchorages, or remove it from the vehicle. Do not leave
(Continued)

Children who are large enough to wear the shoulder
belt comfortably, and whose legs are long enough to
bend over the front of the seat when their back is
against the seatback, should use the seat belt in a rear
seat. Use this simple 5-step test to decide whether the
child can use the vehicle’s seat belt alone:
1. Can the child sit all the way back against the back of
the vehicle seat?
2. Do the child’s knees bend comfortably over the front
of the vehicle seat – while the child is still sitting all
the way back?
3. Does the shoulder belt cross the child’s shoulder
between the neck and arm?
4. Is the lap part of the belt as low as possible, touching
the child’s thighs and not the stomach?

SAFETY

5. Can the child stay seated like this for the whole trip?
If the answer to any of these questions was “no,” then
the child still needs to use a booster seat in this vehicle.
If the child is using the lap/shoulder belt, check seat
belt fit periodically and make sure the seat belt buckle is
latched. A child’s squirming or slouching can move the
belt out of position. If the shoulder belt contacts the face
or neck, move the child closer to the center of the
vehicle, or use a booster seat to position the seat belt on
the child correctly.

WARNING!
Never allow a child to put the shoulder belt under
an arm or behind their back. In a crash, the shoulder
belt will not protect a child properly, which may
result in serious injury or death. A child must
always wear both the lap and shoulder portions of
the seat belt correctly.

125

Installing Child Restraints Using The Vehicle
Seat Belt
Child restraint systems are designed to be secured in
vehicle seats by lap belts or the lap belt portion of a
lap/shoulder belt.

WARNING!
• Improper installation or failure to properly secure
a child restraint can lead to failure of the restraint.
The child could be badly injured or killed.
• Follow the child restraint manufacturer’s directions exactly when installing an infant or child
restraint.

126 SAFETY

The seat belt in the passenger seating position is
equipped with a Switchable Automatic Locking Retractor (ALR) that is designed to keep the lap portion of the
seat belt tight around the child restraint so that it is not
necessary to use a locking clip. The ALR retractor can be
“switched” into a locked mode by pulling all of the
webbing out of the retractor and then letting the webbing retract back into the retractor. If it is locked, the
ALR will make a clicking noise while the webbing is
pulled back into the retractor.

Installing A Child Restraint With A Switchable
Automatic Locking Retractor (ALR)
Child restraint systems are designed to be secured in
vehicle seats by lap belts or the lap belt portion of a
lap/shoulder belt.

WARNING!
• Improper installation or failure to properly secure
a child restraint can lead to failure of the restraint.
The child could be badly injured or killed.
• Follow the child restraint manufacturer’s directions exactly when installing an infant or child
restraint.

1. Place the child seat in the center of the seating
position. Move the vehicle seat as far rearward as
possible to keep the child as far from the passenger
air bag as possible.
2. Pull enough of the seat belt webbing from the
retractor to pass it through the belt path of the child
restraint. Do not twist the belt webbing in the belt
path.
3. Slide the latch plate into the buckle until you hear a
“click.”
4. Pull on the webbing to make the lap portion tight
against the child seat.

5

128 SAFETY

5. To lock the seat belt, pull down on the shoulder part
of the belt until you have pulled all the seat belt
webbing out of the retractor. Then, allow the webbing to retract back into the retractor. As the webbing
retracts, you will hear a clicking sound. This means
the seat belt is now in the Automatic Locking mode.
6. Try to pull the webbing out of the retractor. If it is
locked, you should not be able to pull out any
webbing. If the retractor is not locked, repeat step 5.

Any seat belt system will loosen with time, so check the
belt occasionally, and pull it tight if necessary.
Installing Child Restraints Using The Top Tether
Anchorage:
Always use the tether anchor when using the seat belt
to install a forward facing child restraint, up to the
recommended weight limit of the child restraint. This
vehicle is equipped with a tether anchorage, located
behind the front passenger seat, near the floor.

7. Finally, pull up on any excess webbing to tighten the
lap portion around the child restraint while you push
the child restraint rearward and downward into the
vehicle seat.
8. If the child restraint has a top tether strap and the
seating position has a top tether anchorage, connect
the tether strap to the anchorage and tighten the
tether strap. See the section “Installing Child Restraints Using the Top Tether Anchorage” for directions to attach a tether anchor.
9. Test that the child restraint is installed tightly by
pulling back and forth on the child seat at the belt
path. It should not move more than 1 inch (25.4 mm)
in any direction.

Upper Tether Anchorage

1. Look behind the seating position where you plan to
install the child restraint to find the tether anchorage.
You may need to move the seat forward to provide

SAFETY

better access to the tether anchorage. If there is no
top tether anchorage for that seating position, move
the child restraint to another position in the vehicle if
one is available.
2. Route the tether strap around the outboard side of
the head restraint to the tether anchorage.
3. Attach the tether strap hook of the child restraint to
the top tether anchorage as shown in the diagram.
4. Remove slack in the tether strap according to the
child restraint manufacturer’s instructions.

WARNING!
An incorrectly anchored tether strap could lead to
increased head motion and possible injury to the
child. Use only the anchorage position directly
behind the child seat to secure a child restraint top
tether strap.
Transporting Pets
Air Bags deploying in the front seat could harm your
pet. An unrestrained pet will be thrown about and
possibly injured, or injure a passenger during panic
braking or in a collision.

129

Pets should be restrained in the rear seat (if equipped)
in pet harnesses or pet carriers that are secured by seat
belts.

AREA.

WARNING!
• Do not leave children or animals inside parked
vehicles in hot weather. Interior heat build-up
may cause serious injury or death.
• It is extremely dangerous to ride in a cargo area,
inside or outside of a vehicle. In a collision,
people riding in these areas are more likely to be
seriously injured or killed.
• Do not allow people to ride in any area of your
vehicle that is not equipped with seats and seat
belts.
• Be sure everyone in your vehicle is in a seat and
using a seat belt properly.

130 SAFETY

Exhaust Gas

WARNING!
Exhaust gases can injure or kill. They contain
carbon monoxide (CO), which is colorless and odorless. Breathing it can make you unconscious and
can eventually poison you. To avoid breathing
(CO), follow these safety tips:
• Do not run the engine in a closed garage or in
confined areas any longer than needed to move
your vehicle in or out of the area.
• If you are required to drive with the trunk/
liftgate/rear doors open, make sure that all windows are closed and the climate control BLOWER
switch is set at high speed. DO NOT use the
recirculation mode.
• If it is necessary to sit in a parked vehicle with the
engine running, adjust your heating or cooling
controls to force outside air into the vehicle. Set
the blower at high speed.
The best protection against carbon monoxide entry into
the vehicle body is a properly maintained engine exhaust system.

Whenever a change is noticed in the sound of the
exhaust system, when exhaust fumes can be detected
inside the vehicle, or when the underside or rear of the
vehicle is damaged, have a competent mechanic inspect
the complete exhaust system and adjacent body areas
for broken, damaged, deteriorated, or mispositioned
parts. Open seams or loose connections could permit
exhaust fumes to seep into the passenger compartment.
In addition, inspect the exhaust system each time the
vehicle is raised for lubrication or oil change. Replace as
required.
Safety Checks You Should Make Inside The
Vehicle
Seat Belts
Inspect the seat belt system periodically, checking for
cuts, frays, and loose parts. Damaged parts must be
replaced immediately. Do not disassemble or modify
the system.
Front seat belt assemblies must be replaced after a
collision. Rear seat belt assemblies must be replaced
after a collision if they have been damaged (i.e., bent
retractor, torn webbing, etc.). If there is any question
regarding seat belt or retractor condition, replace the
seat belt.

Air Bag Warning Light

Floor Mat Safety Information

The Air Bag warning light
will turn on for four to
eight seconds as a bulb check when the ignition
switch is first turned to ON/RUN. If the light is
either not on during starting, stays on, or turns on
while driving, have the system inspected at an
authorized dealer as soon as possible. After the bulb
check, this light will illuminate with a single chime
when a fault with the Air Bag System has been
detected. It will stay on until the fault is removed. If
the light comes on intermittently or remains on while
driving, have an authorized dealer service the vehicle immediately.

Always use floor mats designed to fit your vehicle.
Only use a floor mat that does not interfere with the
operation of the accelerator, brake or clutch pedals.
Only use a floor mat that is securely attached using the

STARTING AND OPERATING 137

STARTING THE ENGINE
Before starting your vehicle, adjust your seat, adjust
both inside and outside mirrors, and fasten your seat
belts.

WARNING!
• Never leave children alone in a vehicle, or with
access to an unlocked vehicle.
• Allowing children to be in a vehicle unattended is
dangerous for a number of reasons. A child or
others could be seriously or fatally injured. Children should be warned not to touch the parking
brake, brake pedal or the transmission gear selector.
• Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle (or
in a location accessible to children). A child could
operate power windows, other controls, or move
the vehicle.
Automatic Transmission
To start the engine, press the brake pedal. The system
engages NEUTRAL (N) automatically.
After the starting procedure, FIRST (1st) gear or REVERSE (R) can be engaged.

Irrespective of the mode selected (AUTO/MANUAL),
to engage FIRST (1st) gear or REVERSE (R), it is
necessary to press the brake pedal and push the 1
button on the transmission control panel (or the ⬙+⬙
steering wheel stalk) to engage FIRST (1st) gear or the R
button to engage REVERSE (R).
When FIRST (1st) gear is engaged, the system sets itself
to AUTO mode.
NEUTRAL (N) can be engaged again by pushing the N 6
button with the brake pedal pressed.
When the 1, N, or R buttons are pushed (or ⬙+⬙ steering
wheel stalk is operated) without pressing the brake
pedal, no gear change request is implemented by the
system.
NOTE: REVERSE (R) cannot be engaged by pushing the
⬙-⬙ stalk on the steering wheel.
Normal Starting
NOTE: Normal starting of either a cold or a warm
engine is obtained without pumping or pressing the
accelerator pedal.
Turn the ignition switch to the AVV (START) position
and release it when the engine starts. If the engine fails

138 STARTING AND OPERATING

to start within 10 seconds, turn the ignition switch to
the STOP (OFF/LOCK) position, wait 10 to 15 seconds,
then repeat the “Normal Starting” procedure.
Cold Weather Operation
Your engine is designed to operate at temperatures as
low as 0°F (-18°C).

CAUTION!
Use of the recommended oil and adhering to the
prescribed oil change intervals is important to prevent engine damage and ensure satisfactory starting
in cold conditions.
If Engine Fails To Start

WARNING!
Never pour fuel or other flammable liquids into the
throttle body air inlet opening in an attempt to start
the vehicle. This could result in a flash fire causing
serious personal injury.

CAUTION!
• Do not attempt to push or tow your vehicle to get
it started. Vehicles equipped with a Alfa Twin
Clutch Transmission cannot be started this way.
Unburned fuel could enter the catalytic converter
and once the engine has started, ignite and damage the converter and vehicle.
• To prevent damage to the starter, do not continuously crank the engine for more than 15 seconds at
a time. Wait 10 to 15 seconds before trying again.
After Starting
The idle speed is controlled automatically, and it will
decrease as the engine warms up.
Turbo Charger “Cool Down”
This vehicle is equipped with an after-run pump to cool
the turbocharger after the engine is shut off. Depending
on the type of driving and the amount of cargo, the
pump will run for up to five minutes after the engine
has been shut off to circulate coolant through the
turbocharger.
Although the pump is rubber-mounted for quiet operation, it is normal to hear it running during this time.

STARTING AND OPERATING 139

ENGINE BREAK-IN RECOMMENDATIONS

• Avoid excessive idling.

A long break-in period is not required for the drivetrain
(engine, transmission, and rear axle) in your new vehicle.

• Check the engine oil level at every fuel fill.

Driving your vehicle with a new transmission requires
no special techniques but, to reach optimal shifting
quality and help with engine Break-in, Dynamic and
Race Mode will be inhibited until the vehicle has
accumulated 155 miles (250 km).

Before leaving the vehicle, make sure that the parking
brake is fully applied. Also, be certain to leave manual
transmission in REVERSE (R) or FIRST (1st) gear.

Additionally, for the first 200 miles (300 km), following
these few simple guidelines is all that is necessary for a
good break-in.

PARKING BRAKE

The parking brake lever is located in the central tunnel.
To apply the parking brake, pull the parking brake lever 6
up as firmly as possible. To release the parking brake,
pull the parking brake lever up slightly, push the center
button, then lower the parking brake lever completely.

• Avoid very aggressive driving.
• Avoid driving at a constant speed, either fast or slow,
for long periods.
• Do not make any full throttle starts and avoid full
throttle acceleration while cruising within the posted
speed limits of local traffic laws.
• Use the proper gear for your speed range.
• Wait until the engine has reached normal operating
temperature before driving at the recommended
maximum break-in speed.

Parking Brake Lever

140 STARTING AND OPERATING

When the parking brake is applied with the ignition
switch in the MAR (ACC/ON/RUN) position, the
Brake Warning Light in the instrument cluster display
will illuminate.
When parking on a hill, it is important to turn the front
wheels toward the curb on a downhill grade and away
from the curb on an uphill grade. The parking brake
should always be applied whenever the driver is not in
the vehicle.

WARNING!
• Never leave children alone in a vehicle, or with
access to an unlocked vehicle.
• Allowing children to be in a vehicle unattended is
dangerous for a number of reasons. A child or
others could be seriously or fatally injured. Children should be warned not to touch the parking
brake, brake pedal or the transmission gear selector.
• Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle or
in a location accessible to children. A child could
operate power windows, other controls, or move
the vehicle.
(Continued)

WARNING! (Continued)
• Be sure the parking brake is fully disengaged
before driving; failure to do so can lead to brake
failure and a collision.
• Always fully apply the parking brake when leaving your vehicle, or it may roll and cause damage
or injury. Also be certain to leave a manual
transmission in REVERSE or FIRST gear. Failure
to do so may allow the vehicle to roll and cause
damage or injury.

CAUTION!
If the Brake Warning Light remains on with the
parking brake released, a brake system malfunction
is indicated. Have the brake system serviced by an
authorized dealer immediately.

STARTING AND OPERATING 141

SIX-SPEED ALFA TWIN CLUTCH
TRANSMISSION

WARNING! (Continued)

WARNING!
• It is dangerous to shift out of NEUTRAL if the
engine speed is higher than idle speed. If your
foot is not firmly pressing the brake pedal, the
vehicle could accelerate quickly forward or in
reverse. You could lose control of the vehicle and
hit someone or something. Only shift into gear
when the engine is idling normally and your foot
is firmly pressing the brake pedal.
• Unintended movement of a vehicle could injure
those in or near the vehicle. As with all vehicles,
you should never exit a vehicle while the engine
is running.
• Before exiting the vehicle, always come to a
complete stop, then apply the parking brake, shift
the transmission into FIRST gear or REVERSE,
turn the engine OFF, remove the key fob, and lock
the vehicle.
• Never leave children alone in a vehicle, or with
access to an unlocked vehicle. Allowing children
(Continued)

to be in a vehicle unattended is dangerous for a
number of reasons. A child or others could be
seriously or fatally injured. Children should be
warned not to touch the parking brake, brake
pedal or the transmission gear selector.
• Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle (or
in a location accessible to children). A child could
operate power windows, other controls, or move
the vehicle.
Using The Transmission
This vehicle is equipped with a Six-Speed Alfa Twin
Clutch transmission with steering wheel mounted shift
paddles.
When the ignition is in the OFF position, the transmission controls (shift paddles on the steering wheel, and
gear selector buttons on the center console) are disabled.
When the key is turned to the ON position, the current
transmission gear will be displayed in the instrument
cluster, along with the ⬙AUTO⬙ indicator. This indicates
the transmission is in Automatic mode.

6

142 STARTING AND OPERATING

When the “Race” mode is selected via the DNA selector,
the only allowed transmission operating mode is
MANUAL.
MANUAL Mode
In this operating mode, the driver is responsible for
choosing the best gear to engage, depending on the
vehicle’s operating conditions. The current gear is displayed in the instrument cluster.

Transmission Gear Selector

Operating Modes
The transmission has two normal operating modes
(except when the “Race” mode is selected on the DNA
switch):
• MANUAL mode: The driver must shift gears manually (using the steering wheel mounted shift
paddles).
• Automatic (AUTO) mode: The system shifts between
all forward gears automatically.

To activate/deactivate MANUAL mode, push the A/M
button on the center console when the transmission is in
any forward gear.
Use the “+” shift paddle to engage a higher gear, or the
“–” paddle to engage a lower gear.
If a requested gear shift is not allowed (typically,
because it would cause engine overspeed or lugging),
an acoustic signal will sound and the transmission will
remain in the existing gear.
The transmission will automatically downshift during
closed-throttle decelerations, to prevent engine lugging.
When coming to a stop, the transmission will automatically select FIRST (1st) gear. The driver must manually
upshift the transmission (by tapping the + shift paddle)
as the vehicle accelerates.

STARTING AND OPERATING 143

NOTE: To provide better comfort, the transmission will
up-shift to the next available gear if the engine speed
limit is reached. This feature is only available in NATURAL and ALL WEATHER Modes.
AUTO Mode
In AUTO mode the transmission shifts gears automatically depending on vehicle speed, engine RPM, and
accelerator pedal position.
AUTO is the default operating mode at startup. When
in AUTO mode, ⬙AUTO⬙ appears in the instrument
cluster, adjacent to the current gear display.
To toggle between AUTO and MANUAL modes, push
the A/M button on the center console.
Accelerating From A Stop
FIRST (1) and REVERSE (R) can only be engaged (at a
stop) when the brake pedal is pressed.
To drive, press the brake pedal, and select 1 (1st) or R
(REVERSE) using the transmission gear selector buttons
on the center console. Then release the brake pedal and
smoothly press the accelerator pedal.

NOTE:
• The vehicle will not “creep” when the brake pedal is
released, and may in fact roll down on an incline.
Leaving from a stop, the accelerator pedal must be
pressed to transmit driving torque to the wheels.
• When starting on a fairly steep incline, it may be
helpful to engage the parking brake.
• The vehicle can only be launched (from a stop) in
FIRST (1) or REVERSE (R). Second gear (or higher) 6
cannot be engaged when the vehicle is stationary.
• If the brake pedal is not depressed (and the vehicle is
stationary for a period of time), the transmission will
automatically engage NEUTRAL (N).
• FIRST (1) and REVERSE (R) gears can only be
engaged at vehicle speeds below 2 mph (3 km/h). At
speeds below 6 mph (10 km/h), attempts to shift
from 1 to R (or R to 1) will only be allowed if the
vehicle speed drops below the 2 mph (3 km/h)
threshold within three seconds of the request; otherwise, the transmission will shift to NEUTRAL (N).
The driver should then repeat the request for 1st or R
once the vehicle has come to a stop.

144 STARTING AND OPERATING

Shift Paddles
In MANUAL mode, the steering wheel mounted shift
paddles (labeled + and -) control the transmission
shifting.
Tapping the (+) paddle will upshift the transmission to
the next higher gear, while tapping the (-) paddle will
downshift to the next lower gear. The current gear is
displayed in the instrument cluster. If a requested shift
would cause engine lugging or overspeed, that request
will be ignored.
In AUTO mode, tapping a shift paddle will temporarily
place the transmission in MANUAL mode, and execute
the requested upshift or downshift (if allowable). The
transmission will then return to AUTO mode after a
brief interval.
Pressing a shift paddle will only shift the transmission
one gear at a time. Holding a paddle depressed will not
command multiple shifts; the paddle must be pressed
multiple times in succession to generate multiple shifts.
Neutral (N)
Use this range when the vehicle is standing for prolonged periods with the engine running. Always apply
the parking brake if you must exit the vehicle.

At engine startup, the transmission will automatically
select NEUTRAL (N) and AUTO mode. The brake pedal
must be pressed when starting the engine.
To select NEUTRAL (N) when the vehicle is stationary,
turn the ignition key to the MAR-ON position (engine
running or not), press the brake pedal, and push the N
button on the transmission gear selector.
When the vehicle is moving (with ignition ON), pushing the NEUTRAL (N) button will engage N, regardless
of whether the brake pedal is pressed.

WARNING!
Do not coast in NEUTRAL and never turn off the
ignition to coast down a hill. Coasting in NEUTRAL
and turning off the ignition while coasting severely
limit your ability to respond to changing traffic or
road conditions. Failure to follow this WARNING
may result in loss of vehicle control, collision, and
serious injury or death.
With the vehicle in motion, to engage a gear from the
NEUTRAL (N) position, push the 1 button on the
transmission control panel (it is not necessary to press

STARTING AND OPERATING 145

the brake pedal). The transmission will engage the
correct gear according to the vehicle’s speed.
Acoustic Signal
If the vehicle is stationary with the engine running and
FIRST (1) or REVERSE (R) engaged, the system activates an acoustic signal and automatically places the
transmission in NEUTRAL (N) when:
• The accelerator and/or brake pedal are not operated
for at least three minutes.
• The brake pedal is pressed for longer than 10 minutes.
• The driver’s door is opened and the accelerator pedal
or the brake pedal are not operated for at least one
and a half seconds.
• A fault has been detected in the transmission.
Parking The Vehicle
When parking and leaving the vehicle, proceed as
follows:
1. Make sure that the vehicle has come to a complete
stop.

2. With the brake pedal depressed, put the vehicle into
either a forward or reverse gear by pushing 1 or R.
(The vehicle may already be in 1 or R if you were just
driving.)
3. Engage the parking brake.
4. Turn off and remove the key.
5. Release the brake pedal.
When parking on an incline, turn the front wheels 6
toward the curb on a downhill slope and away from the
curb on an uphill slope. Always chock the wheels when
parking on steep grades.
General Notes
When the vehicle is stopped and in gear, always keep
the brake pedal pressed until you decide to set off, then
release the brake and accelerate gradually.
During prolonged stops with the engine running, it is
advisable to keep the transmission in NEUTRAL (N).
When stopped on an incline, always hold the vehicle in
place using the brakes. On steep inclines, Hill Start
Assist (HSA) will temporarily hold the vehicle in position when the brake pedal is released. If the accelerator

146 STARTING AND OPERATING

pedal is not applied after a short time, the vehicle will
roll back. Either reapply the brake (to hold the vehicle)
or press the accelerator to climb the hill.

• Dynamic (This mode alters the transmission’s automatic shift schedule for sportier driving [D]).

Only shift between FIRST (1) and REVERSE (R) when
completely stopped, with the brake pedal pressed.

• All Weather (mode for driving in poor grip conditions, such as rain and snow [A]).

When necessary, it is possible to engage FIRST (1),
REVERSE (R) or NEUTRAL (N) with the engine off, the
key at MAR-ON and the brake pressed. In this case,
wait at least five seconds between one gear change and
the next, in order to safeguard the operation of the
hydraulic system, and the pump in particular.

• Race (sports driving mode [D]).

• Natural (mode for driving in normal conditions [N]).

This also acts on the dynamic vehicle control systems
(engine, gearbox/transmission, ESC system).

For uphill departures, accelerate gradually but fully,
immediately after releasing the parking brake or the
brake pedal; this allows the engine speed to increase to
provide more torque at the wheels.
ALFA DNA SYSTEM (DYNAMIC VEHICLE
CONTROL SYSTEM)
This vehicle is equipped with a “Alfa DNA” system
lever (located on the center console). There are four
modes of operation to be selected according to driving
style and road conditions:

Alfa DNA Mode Selector

Move the Alfa DNA system lever upwards (to the letter
“D”) and hold in this position for half a second, until
the corresponding LED lights up and the Dynamic
mode activation indicator appears on the display.
When Dynamic mode is activated, the turbocharger
pressure and engine oil temperature screen is displayed
automatically. When released, the Alfa DNA system
lever will return to the central position.
NOTE: Dynamic Mode will be inhibited until the
vehicle has accumulated 155 miles (250 km).

Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and Anti-Slip
Regulation (ASR) systems:
The ESC and ASR system ensures more enjoyable,
sportier driving while guaranteeing the stability of the
vehicle.
Electronic Q2 system:
The system increases vehicle stability while accelerating
on bends, improving the agility of the vehicle.
Engine And Gearbox/Transmission:

displayed automatically. This considers gravitational
acceleration (G).
Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and Anti-Slip
Regulation (ASR) systems:
These systems are deactivated in order to ensure the
fullest sensation of sport, leaving the driver in full
control of the vehicle. When the vehicle is in unstable
conditions, the ESC reactivates automatically when the
brake pedal is pressed until the ABS intervenes, thus
returning the vehicle to stable conditions. To deactivate
the ESC and ASR systems, reactivate Race mode.
Electronic Q2 system:
The system increases vehicle stability while accelerating
on bends, improving the agility of the vehicle.

NOTE: In Race mode, the sensitivity of the accelerator

System Failure
In the event of system failure or a fault with the gear
selector, no driving modes can be selected.

150 STARTING AND OPERATING

The display will become grey (same screen as ⬙Natural⬙
mode) but without an indication of the Alfa DNA
setting. The display will also show a warning message.
Please contact your authorized dealer for service.
Launch Control
The Launch Control strategy permits high-performance
acceleration from stand still.
This strategy can be activated with vehicle at a standstill, Race mode selected and FIRST (1st) gear engaged.
The sequence of operations to perform is as follows:
1. Press the brake pedal and hold it down.
2. Press the accelerator pedal and hold it down.
3. Press the ⬙–⬙ paddle behind the steering wheel. (This
allows the engine to rev above the 3000 RPM limit.)
When the brake pedal is released, the vehicle will start
with maximum acceleration. Despite the MANUAL
mode, the vehicle will automatically shift the gear to
guarantee maximum acceleration, once the correct shifting speed has been reached.

WARNING!
Launch Control is intended for off-highway or
off-road use only and should not be used on any
public roadways. Use Launch Control only in a
controlled and dry track environment; within the
limits of the law. Actual Launch Control performance may change depending on the surface and
current traction conditions. The capabilities of the
vehicle as measured by the performance pages must
never be exploited in a reckless or dangerous manner, which can jeopardize the user’s safety or the
safety of others. Only a safe, attentive, and skillful
driver can prevent accidents. Failure to follow this
warning may result in serious injury or death.
To discontinue the strategy, simply interrupt the above
sequence of operations or release the accelerator pedal.
SPEED CONTROL — IF EQUIPPED
When engaged, the Speed Control takes over accelerator operations at speeds greater than 18 mph (30 km/h),
up to the maximum speed of 105 mph (170 km/h).
The Speed Control Lever is located on the left side of the
steering column.

STARTING AND OPERATING 151

NOTE: In order to ensure proper operation, the Speed
Control system has been designed to shut down if
multiple speed control functions are operated at the same
time. If this occurs, the Speed Control system can be
reactivated rotating the end of the multifunction lever
(on/off) and resetting the desired vehicle set speed.

activate the Speed Control. The Cruise Control Indicator Light in the instrument cluster display will illuminate. To turn the system off, rotate the end of the
multifunction lever to the O (off) position. The Cruise
Control Indicator Light will turn off. The system should
be turned off when not in use.

WARNING!
Leaving the Speed Control system on when not in
use is dangerous. You could accidentally set the
system or cause it to go faster than you want. You
could lose control and have an accident. Always
leave the system off when you are not using it.
To Set A Desired Speed

152 STARTING AND OPERATING

To Vary The Speed Setting

To Decrease Speed

To Increase Speed

When the Speed Control is set, you can decrease speed
by tapping the speed control lever down (-).

When the Speed Control is set, you can increase speed
by tapping the speed control lever up (+).
The speed increment shown is dependant on the speed
of U.S. (mph) or Metric (km/h) units:
U.S. Speed (mph)
• Tapping the speed control lever up (+) once will
result in a one mph increase in set speed. Each
subsequent tap of the lever results in an increase of
one mph.
• If the lever is continually held, the set speed will
continue to increase until the lever is released, then
the new set speed will be established.
Metric Speed (km/h)
• Tapping the speed control lever up (+) once will
result in a two km/h increase in set speed. Each
subsequent tap of the lever results in an increase of
two km/h.
• If the lever is continually held, the set speed will
continue to increase until the lever is released, then
the new set speed will be established.

The speed decrement shown is dependant on the speed
of U.S. (mph) or Metric (km/h) units:
U.S. Speed (mph)
• Tapping the speed control lever down (-) once will
result in a one mph decrease in set speed. Each
subsequent tap of the lever results in a decrease of
one mph.
• If the lever is continually held down, the set speed
will continue to decrease until the lever is released,
then the new set speed will be established.
Metric Speed (km/h)
• Tapping the speed control lever down (-) once will
result in a two km/h decrease in set speed. Each
subsequent tap of the lever results in a decrease of
two km/h.
• If the lever is continually held down, the set speed
will continue to decrease until the lever is released,
then the new set speed will be established.

STARTING AND OPERATING 153

To Accelerate For Passing

PARKING SENSORS — IF EQUIPPED

Press the accelerator as you would normally. When the
pedal is released, the vehicle will return to the set speed.

The vehicle’s parking sensors are located in the rear
bumper, and will detect the presence of any obstacles
near the rear part of the vehicle while moving in
REVERSE gear. The driver is then informed through an
intermittent acoustic signal.

To Resume Speed
To resume a previously set speed, push the CANCEL/
RESUME button, located on the end of the speed
control stalk, and release. Resume can be used at any
speed above 18 mph (30 km/h).

6

To Deactivate
A soft tap on the brake pedal, pushing the CANCEL/
RESUME button on the end of the stalk, or normal
brake pressure while slowing the vehicle will deactivate
the Speed Control without erasing the set speed
memory. Rotating the end of the multifunction lever to
the O (off) position, or turning the ignition switch to
OFF, erases the set speed memory.
Parking Sensors

154 STARTING AND OPERATING

Acoustic Signal

Indications On Display — If Equipped

When REVERSE gear is engaged, and there is an
obstacle behind the vehicle, an acoustic signal is emitted
which varies according to the distance of the bumper
from the obstacle.

When the sensors are activated, the parking sensor
display screen appears in the instrument cluster.

The frequency of the acoustic signal:
• Increases as the distance between vehicle and obstacle decreases, culminating in a continuous acoustic signal when the distance is less than approximately 12 inches (30 cm).
• Decreases if the distance from the obstacle increases,
until the signal ceases entirely.
• Remains constant if the distance between vehicle and
obstacle remains unchanged; if this situation concerns the side sensors, the signal will stop after
approximately 3 seconds, for example, in the event of
parking along a wall.
If several obstacles are detected by the sensors, only the
nearest one is considered.

Parking Sensor Display Screen

Obstacle presence and distance information is therefore
provided both by the acoustic signal and the instrument
cluster display.
The system indicates a detected obstacle by displaying
an arc in one or more positions according to the distance
of the obstacle and its position in relation to the vehicle.

STARTING AND OPERATING 155

If an obstacle is detected in the rear central area, the
instrument cluster display shows all the arcs in the rear
central area, up to the one that corresponds to the
position of the obstacle itself.
The signal is similar for obstacles in the rear left or right
area.
The arc that corresponds to the position of the obstacle
will flash.
The color on the instrument cluster display depends on
the distance from and position of the obstacle.
The vehicle is close to the obstacle when the instrument
cluster display shows a single constant arc and emits a
continuous sound.
If there are several obstacles, the closest one is indicated.
Activation/Deactivation
The sensors are automatically activated when REVERSE
gear is engaged and a visual display will appear in the
instrument cluster display. As the obstacle behind the
vehicle gets closer, the acoustic signal becomes more
frequent.

Fault Indication
Parking sensor failures, if any, will be indicated when
REVERSE gear is engaged by the illumination of the
warning light in the instrument cluster display.
General Warnings
When parking, take the utmost care over obstacles that
may be above or under the sensor.
Under certain circumstances, objects close to the vehicle 6
are not detected by the system and could therefore
cause damage to the vehicle or be damaged themselves.
Some conditions may influence the performance of the
parking sensors:
• The presence of ice, snow, mud or multiple layers of
paint on the sensor surface may cause reduced
sensitivity of the sensor itself and therefore reduce
the system performance.
• Mechanical interference (e.g washing the vehicle,
rain, strong wind, hail) may cause the sensor to
detect a non-existent obstacle (“echo interference”).
• The presence of ultrasonic systems (e.g. pneumatic
brake systems of trucks or pneumatic drills) near the
vehicle could alter the signals sent by the sensor.

156 STARTING AND OPERATING

• The variation in sensor position, caused by variation
in ride (due to suspension component wear), changing tires, overloaded vehicle, or tuning that lowers
the vehicle, for example, may affect parking sensor
system performance.
NOTE: The sensor must be free from mud, dirt snow or
ice in order for the system to operate correctly. Be
careful not to scratch or damage the sensors while
cleaning them. Avoid using dry, rough or hard cloths.
The sensors must be washed using clean water, with the
addition of car shampoo if necessary. When using
special washing equipment such as high pressure jets or
steam cleaning, clean the sensors very quickly keeping
the jet more than 4 inches (10 cm) away. Also, do not
apply stickers to the sensors.

WARNING!
Drivers must be careful when backing up even
when using the Parking Sensor system. Always
check carefully behind your vehicle, and be sure to
check for pedestrians, animals, other vehicles, obstructions, or blind spots before backing up. You
are responsible for the safety of your surroundings
(Continued)

WARNING! (Continued)
and must continue to pay attention while backing
up. Failure to do so can result in serious injury or
death.

CAUTION!
• The Parking Sensor system is only a parking aid
and it is unable to recognize every obstacle,
including small obstacles. Parking curbs might be
temporarily detected or not detected at all. Obstacles located above or below the sensors will
not be detected when they are in close proximity.
• The vehicle must be driven slowly when using
the Parking Sensor system in order to be able to
stop in time when an obstacle is detected. It is
recommended that the driver looks over his/her
shoulder when using the Parking Sensor system.
PARKVIEW REAR BACK UP CAMERA
The ParkView Rear Back Up Camera allows you to see
an on-screen image of your vehicle’s rear surroundings
when the gear selector is put into REVERSE. The image
will be displayed on the rearview mirror along with a

STARTING AND OPERATING 157

note to “check entire surroundings.” After five seconds
this note will disappear. The ParkView camera is located on the trunk lid below the brake light.
When the vehicle is shifted out of REVERSE, the camera
image will continue to be displayed for up to 10 seconds
after shifting out of REVERSE.
Fixed guide lines are overlaid on the image to illustrate
the width of the vehicle.
Different colored zones indicate the distance to the rear
of the vehicle.
The following table shows the approximate distances
for each zone:
Zone
Red
Yellow
Green

Distance To The Rear
Of The Vehicle
0 - 1 ft (0 - 30 cm)
1 ft - 3 ft (30 cm - 1 m)
3 ft or greater (1 m or greater)

NOTE: If snow, ice, mud, or any foreign substance
builds up on the camera lens, clean the lens, rinse with
water, and dry with a soft cloth. Do not cover the lens.

WARNING!
Drivers must be careful when backing up even
when using the ParkView Rear Back Up Camera.
Always check carefully behind your vehicle, and be
sure to check for pedestrians, animals, other vehicles, obstructions, or blind spots before backing
up. You are responsible for the safety of your
surroundings and must continue to pay attention
while backing up. Failure to do so can result in
serious injury or death.

CAUTION!
• To avoid vehicle damage, ParkView should only
be used as a parking aid. The ParkView camera is
unable to view every obstacle or object in your
drive path.
• To avoid vehicle damage, the vehicle must be
driven slowly when using ParkView to be able to
stop in time when an obstacle is seen. It is
recommended that the driver look frequently
over his/her shoulder when using ParkView.

ADDING FUEL/SMART FUEL
NOTE:

2. There is no fuel filler cap. A flap door inside the pipe
seals the system.

• The ⬙Smart Fuel⬙ is a device placed on the top of the
filler pipe; it opens and closes automatically when
the fuel nozzle is inserted or extracted.
• Only the correct nozzle size diameter allows the flap
door to open when the nozzle is inserted.
Refueling Procedure
1. Open the fuel filler door pulling towards outside.

Fuel Nozzle Location

3. Insert the fuel nozzle into the filler pipe (the nozzle
opens and holds the flap door while refueling) and
start refueling. When the fuel nozzle “clicks” or shuts
off, the fuel tank is full.
4. At the end of refueling, before removing the nozzle,
wait at least 10 seconds to allow the fuel to flow
within the tank.
Fuel Filler Door Location

5. Remove the fuel nozzle from the filler pipe and then
close the fuel door.

STARTING AND OPERATING 159

Emergency Gas Can Refueling:

4. Pour fuel into funnel opening.

Most gas cans will not open the flapper door.

5. Remove funnel from filler pipe, clean off prior to
putting back in the storage area.

A funnel is provided to open the flapper door to allow
emergency refueling with a gas can.
1. Retrieve the appropriate funnel from the storage area
in the luggage compartment.
2. Insert funnel into same filler pipe opening as the fuel
nozzle.

WARNING!
• Never have any smoking materials lit in or near
the vehicle when the fuel door is open or the tank
is being filled.
• Never add fuel when the engine is running. This
is in violation of most state and federal fire
regulations and may cause the “Malfunction Indicator Light” to turn on.
• A fire may result if fuel is pumped into a portable
container that is inside of a vehicle. You could be
burned. Always place fuel containers on the
ground while filling.

CAUTION!

DRIVING TIPS
Driving On Slippery Surfaces
Information in this section will aid in safe controlled
launches in adverse conditions.
Acceleration
Rapid acceleration on snow covered, wet, or other
slippery surfaces may cause the driving wheels to pull
erratically to the right or left. This phenomenon occurs
when there is a difference in the surface traction under
the rear (driving) wheels.

WARNING!
Rapid acceleration on slippery surfaces is dangerous. Unequal traction can cause sudden pulling of
the rear wheels. You could lose control of the
vehicle and possibly have a collision. Accelerate
slowly and carefully whenever there is likely to be
poor traction (ice, snow, wet, mud, loose sand, etc.).

partial or complete loss of vehicle control and stopping
ability. To reduce this possibility, the following precautions should be observed:
• Slow down during rainstorms or when the roads are
slushy.
• Slow down if the road has standing water or
puddles.
• Replace tires when tread wear indicators first become
6
visible.
• Keep tires properly inflated.
• Maintain sufficient distance between your vehicle
and the vehicle in front of you to avoid a collision in
a sudden stop.
Your vehicle may be equipped with a Limited Slip
Differential (LSD) that reduces, but does not eliminate,
the amount of wheel slip across a given axle for
improved handling.
Driving Through Water

Traction
When driving on wet or slushy roads, it is possible for
a wedge of water to build up between the tire and road
surface. This is known as hydroplaning and may cause

Driving through water more than a few inches/
centimeters deep will require extra caution to ensure
safety and prevent damage to your vehicle.

162 STARTING AND OPERATING

Flowing/Rising Water

WARNING! (Continued)

WARNING!
Do not drive on or across a road or path where water
is flowing and/or rising (as in storm run-off). Flowing water can wear away the road or path’s surface
and cause your vehicle to sink into deeper water.
Furthermore, flowing and/or rising water can carry
your vehicle away swiftly. Failure to follow this
warning may result in injuries that are serious or
fatal to you, your passengers, and others around
you.

• Driving through standing water limits your vehicle’s braking capabilities, which increases stopping distances. Therefore, after driving through
standing water, drive slowly and lightly press on
the brake pedal several times to dry the brakes.
• Failure to follow these warnings may result in
injuries that are serious or fatal to you, your
passengers, and others around you.

CAUTION!

• Driving through standing water limits your vehicle’s traction capabilities. Do not exceed 5 mph
(8 km/h) when driving through standing water.

• Always check the depth of the standing water
before driving through it. Never drive through
standing water that is deeper than the bottom of
the tire rims mounted on the vehicle.
• Determine the condition of the road or the path
that is under water and if there are any obstacles
in the way before driving through the standing
water.
• Do not exceed 5 mph (8 km/h) when driving
through standing water. This will minimize wave
effects.

(Continued)

(Continued)

Shallow Standing Water
Although your vehicle is capable of driving through
shallow standing water, consider the following Cautions and Warnings before doing so.

WARNING!

STARTING AND OPERATING 163

CAUTION! (Continued)
• Driving through standing water may cause damage to your vehicle’s drivetrain components. Always inspect your vehicle’s fluids (i.e., engine oil,
transmission, axle, etc.) for signs of contamination
(i.e., fluid that is milky or foamy in appearance)
after driving through standing water. Do not
continue to operate the vehicle if any fluid appears contaminated, as this may result in further
damage. Such damage is not covered by the New
Vehicle Limited Warranty.
• Getting water inside your vehicle’s engine can
cause it to lock up and stall out, and cause serious
internal damage to the engine. Such damage is
not covered by the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.

vehicle’s 12 Volt power outlet.

IN CASE OF EMERGENCY 185

NOTE: Do not remove foreign objects (e.g., screws or
nails) from the tire.
Injecting Sealant Into The Tire
1. Always start the engine before turning on the Tire
Service Kit.
2. After pushing the Power Button, the sealant (white
fluid) will flow from the sealant cartridge through
the sealant hose and into the tire. As the sealant flows
through the sealant hose, the pressure gauge can
read as high as 70 psi (4.8 Bar). The pressure gauge
will decrease quickly from approximately 70 psi
(4.8 Bar) to the actual tire pressure when the sealant
cartridge is empty.
NOTE: Sealant may leak out through the puncture in
the tire.
3. The pump will start to inject air into the tire immediately after the sealant cartridge is empty. Continue
to operate the pump and inflate the tire to the
pressure indicated on the tire pressure label on the
driver-side latch pillar (recommended pressure).
Check the tire pressure by looking at the pressure
gauge.

NOTE:
• If the tire does not inflate to at least 26 psi (1.8 Bar)
pressure within 15 minutes the tire is too badly
damaged. Do not attempt to drive the vehicle
further. Call for assistance.
• Do not let the compressor be turned on for more
than 20 consecutive minutes. The pump may overheat.
4. Remove sealant cartridge by pushing the cartridge
release button on the side of the compressor.
Drive Vehicle
Immediately after injecting sealant and inflating the
tire, drive the vehicle 5 miles (8 km) or 10 minutes to
ensure distribution of the Tire Service Kit Sealant within
the tire. Do not exceed 50 mph (80 km/h).

WARNING!
Tire Service Kit is not a permanent flat tire repair.
Have the tire inspected and repaired or replaced
after using Tire Service Kit. Do not exceed 50 mph
(80 km/h) until the tire is repaired or replaced.

186 IN CASE OF EMERGENCY

WARNING! (Continued)
Failure to follow this warning can result in injuries
that are serious or fatal to you, your passengers, and
others around you.
After Driving
1. Attach the air pump hose (black) to the repaired tire.
2. Check the pressure in the tire by reading the pressure
gauge. If the pressure is less than 19 psi (1.3 Bar), the
tire is too badly damaged. Do not attempt to drive
the vehicle further. Call for assistance.
NOTE: A replacement sealant cartridge is available at
an authorized dealer.
Tire Service Kit Usage Precautions
• Replace the Tire Service Kit Sealant Cartridge and
Sealant Hose prior to the expiration date (printed on
the left hand side of the cartridge label) to assure
optimum operation of the system.
• The Sealant Cartridge and Sealant Hose are a one tire
application use and need to be replaced after each
use. Always replace these components immediately
at an authorized dealer.

• When the Tire Service Kit sealant is in a liquid form,
clean water, and a damp cloth will remove the
material from the vehicle or tire and wheel components. Once the sealant dries, it can easily be peeled
off and properly discarded.
• For optimum performance, make sure the valve stem
on the wheel is free of debris before connecting the
Tire Service Kit.
• Do not lift or carry the Tire Service Kit by the hoses.
JUMP STARTING
If your vehicle has a discharged battery, it can be jump
started using a set of jumper cables and a battery in
another vehicle, or by using a portable battery booster
pack. Jump starting can be dangerous if done improperly, so please follow the procedures in this section
carefully.

WARNING!
Do not attempt jump starting if the battery is
frozen. It could rupture or explode and cause personal injury.

IN CASE OF EMERGENCY 187

CAUTION!
Do not use a portable battery booster pack or any
other booster source with a system voltage greater
than 12 Volts or damage to the battery, starter motor,
alternator or electrical system may occur.
NOTE: When using a portable battery booster pack,
follow the manufacturer’s operating instructions and
precautions.
Preparations For Jump Start
The battery in your vehicle is located on the left side of
the engine compartment. To access the battery, remove
the protective cover.

7
Positive Battery Post

NOTE: Be sure that the disconnected ends of the cables
do not touch while still connected to the other vehicle.
1. Firmly apply the parking brake, and turn the ignition
OFF.
2. Turn off the heater, radio, and all unnecessary electrical accessories.
3. To remove the protective cover off the battery, pull
upward on the cover.

188 IN CASE OF EMERGENCY

4. If using another vehicle to jump start the battery,
park the vehicle within the jumper cable’s reach,
apply the parking brake and make sure the ignition
is OFF.

WARNING!
Do not allow vehicles to touch each other as this
could establish a ground connection and personal
injury could result.
Jump Starting Procedure
Positive (+) Battery Post

WARNING!

Connecting The Jumper Cables

Failure to follow this jump starting procedure could
result in personal injury or property damage due to
battery explosion.

1. Connect the positive (+) end of the jumper cable to
the positive (+) post of the vehicle with the discharged battery.

CAUTION!

2. Connect the opposite end of the positive (+) jumper
cable to the positive (+) post of the booster battery.

Failure to follow these procedures could result in
damage to the charging system of the booster vehicle or the discharged vehicle.

3. Connect the negative end (-) of the jumper cable to
the negative (-) post of the booster battery.

IN CASE OF EMERGENCY 189

4. Connect the opposite end of the negative (-) jumper
cable to a good engine ground of the vehicle with the
discharged battery (exposed metal part of the engine) away from the battery and the fuel injection
system.

2. Disconnect the negative end (-) of the jumper cable
from the negative (-) post of the booster battery.

WARNING!

4. Disconnect the positive (+) end of the jumper cable
from the positive (+) post of the vehicle with the
discharged battery.

Do not connect the jumper cable to the negative (-)
post of the discharged battery. The resulting electrical spark could cause the battery to explode and
could result in personal injury. Only use the specific ground point, do not use any other exposed
metal parts.
5. Start the engine in the vehicle that has the booster
battery, let the engine idle a few minutes, and then
start the engine in the vehicle with the discharged
battery.
6. Once the engine is started, remove the jumper cables
in the reverse sequence:
Disconnecting The Jumper Cables
1. Disconnect the negative (-) jumper cable from the
engine (-) ground of the vehicle with the discharged
battery.

3. Disconnect the opposite end of the positive (+)
jumper cable from the positive (+) post of the booster
battery.

If frequent jump starting is required to start your
vehicle you should have the battery and charging 7
system inspected at an authorized dealer.

CAUTION!
Accessories plugged into the vehicle power outlets
draw power from the vehicle’s battery, even when
not in use (i.e., cellular devices, etc.). Eventually, if
plugged in long enough without engine operation,
the vehicle’s battery will discharge sufficiently to
degrade battery life and/or prevent the engine from
starting.

190 IN CASE OF EMERGENCY

IF YOUR ENGINE OVERHEATS
In any of the following situations, you can reduce the
potential for overheating by taking the appropriate
action.
• On highways — slow down.
• In city traffic — while stopped, place the transmission in NEUTRAL, but do not increase engine idle
speed.
NOTE: There are steps that you can take to slow down
an impending overheat condition:
• If your air conditioner (A/C) is on, turn it off. The
A/C system adds heat to the engine cooling system
and turning the A/C off can help remove this heat.
• You can also turn the temperature control to maximum heat, the mode control to floor and the blower
control to high. This allows the heater core to act as a
supplement to the radiator and aids in removing heat
from the engine cooling system.

WARNING!
You or others can be badly burned by hot engine
coolant (antifreeze) or steam from your radiator. If
you see or hear steam coming from under the hood,
do not open the hood until the radiator has had time
to cool. Never try to open a cooling system pressure
cap when the radiator or coolant bottle is hot.

CAUTION!
Driving with a hot cooling system could damage
your vehicle. If the temperature gauge reads 240°F
(116°C) or greater pull over and stop the vehicle.
Idle the vehicle with the air conditioner turned off
until the coolant temperature drops back into the
normal range 200–230°F (93–110°C). The digital
warning light may switch on (together with a message on the instrument cluster display) to indicate
that the coolant temperature is too high; in this case,
stop the engine and call for service.

IN CASE OF EMERGENCY 191

TOWING A DISABLED VEHICLE
Front Tow Eye Usage
Your vehicle is equipped with a tow eye that can be
used to tow a disabled vehicle.
The front tow eye receptacle is located on the lower
right side of the front fascia.
To install the tow eye, thread the tow eye into the
receptacle.
NOTE: The front tow eye is stored inside the Tire
Service Kit storage bag.

7
Front Tow Eye Installed

When using a tow eye, be sure to follow the “Tow Eye
Usage Precautions” in this section.

192 IN CASE OF EMERGENCY

• Ensure that the tow eye is properly seated and secure
in the mounting receptacle.
• The tow eye is recommended for use with an approved tow bar and or rope.
• Do not use the tow eye to pull the vehicle onto a
flatbed truck.
• Do not use the tow eye to free a stuck vehicle.

WARNING!
Tow Eye

Tow Eye Usage Precautions
The transmission must be in NEUTRAL when flat
towing this vehicle. The ignition must be ON in order to
place the transmission in NEUTRAL. Therefore, if the
key is unavailable or the battery is discharged, this
vehicle must be towed with all four wheels OFF the
ground (using a vehicle trailer or flatbed truck).

Stand clear of vehicles when pulling with tow eyes.
• Do not use a chain with a tow eye. Chains may
break, causing serious injury or death.
• Do not use a tow strap with a tow eye. Tow straps
may break or become disengaged, causing serious
injury or death.
• Failure to follow proper tow eye usage may cause
components to break resulting in serious injury
or death.

IN CASE OF EMERGENCY 193

CAUTION! (Continued)
• In compliance with the above conditions, towing
with a tow eye must take place with two vehicles
(one towing, the other towed) aligned as much as
possible along the same center line. Damage to
your vehicle may occur if these guidelines are not
followed.
• When towing, only use a facility that can tow
vehicles with low ground clearances as extensive
damage can result by using a standard tow truck
platform.
Tow Eye Warning Label

CAUTION!
• The tow eye must be used exclusively for roadside assistance operations. Only use the tow eye
with an appropriate device in accordance with the
highway code (a rigid bar or rope) to flat tow the
vehicle for a short distance to the nearest service
location.
• Tow eyes MUST NOT be used to tow vehicles off
the road or where there are obstacles.

SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE 197

SCHEDULED SERVICING
Your vehicle is equipped with an automatic oil change
indicator system. The oil change indicator system will
remind you that it is time to take your vehicle in for
scheduled maintenance.

NOTE: The actual interval for changing the oil and
replacing the engine oil filter depends on the vehicle
usage conditions and is signalled by the warning light
or message (if present) on the instrument panel or every
12 months.

Based on engine operation conditions, the oil change
indicator message will illuminate in the instrument
cluster. This means that an engine oil and engine oil
filter change is required for your vehicle. Operating
conditions such as frequent short-trips, trailer tow,
extremely hot or cold ambient temperatures will influence when the “Change Oil” or “Oil Change Required”
message is displayed. Severe Operating Conditions can
cause the change oil message to illuminate as early as
3,500 miles (5,600 km) since last reset. Have your
vehicle serviced as soon as possible, within the next 500
miles (805 km).

Severe Duty All Models

The Wrench Warning Light may appear in the cluster as
a service reminder when vehicle maintenance is required, according to the scheduled maintenance mileage. The maintenance schedule intervals are set by the
manufacturer. Failure to have them carried out may
void your New Vehicle Limited Warranty.

• Allowing the vehicle to sit for long periods of inactivity.

In addition, if your vehicle is used under demanding
conditions, including:
• On the track.
• On dusty roads.
• Short, repeated trips (less than 4-5 miles or 7-8 km) at 8
sub-zero temperatures.
• Allowing the engine to idle for extended periods of
time.

Checking Oil Level

Adding Washer Solvent

To assure proper engine lubrication, the engine oil must be
maintained at the correct level. Check the oil level at
regular intervals. The best time to check the engine oil level
is before starting the engine after it has sat overnight.
Do not check oil level when the engine is warm.
Checking engine oil level when the engine is warm will
give you an incorrect reading.
Checking the oil while the vehicle is on level ground,
and has sat overnight, will improve the accuracy of the
oil level readings. Maintain the oil level between the
range markings on the dipstick. The safe range is
indicated by a crosshatch zone. Adding 1 quart of oil
when the reading is at the low end of the indicated
range will result in the oil level at the full end of the
indicator range.

CAUTION!
Do not overfill the engine with oil. Overfilling the
engine with oil will cause oil aeration, which can
lead to loss of oil pressure and an increase in oil
temperature. This loss of oil pressure and increased
oil temperature could damage your engine.

in the washer reservoir. Refer to “Adding Washer
Solvent” in this chapter for further information.
Then check that the nozzle holes are not clogged; use a
suitable tool such as a needle to unblock them if
necessary.
Exhaust System
The best protection against carbon monoxide entry into
the vehicle body is a properly maintained engine exhaust system.
If you notice a change in the sound of the exhaust
system; or if the exhaust fumes can be detected inside
the vehicle; or when the underside or rear of the vehicle
is damaged; have an authorized technician inspect the
complete exhaust system and adjacent body areas for
broken, damaged, deteriorated, or mispositioned parts.
Open seams or loose connections could permit exhaust
fumes to seep into the passenger compartment. In
addition, have the exhaust system inspected each time
the vehicle is raised for lubrication or oil change.
Replace as required.

WARNING!
• Exhaust gases can injure or kill. They contain
carbon monoxide (CO), which is colorless and
odorless. Breathing it can make you unconscious
and can eventually poison you. To avoid breathing CO, refer to “Safety Tips” in “Safety” for
further information.
• A hot exhaust system can start a fire if you park
over materials that can burn. Such materials
might be grass or leaves coming into contact with
your exhaust system. Do not park or operate your
vehicle in areas where your exhaust system can
contact anything that can burn.

CAUTION!
• The catalytic converter requires the use of unleaded fuel only. Leaded gasoline will destroy the
effectiveness of the catalyst as an emissions control device and may seriously reduce engine performance and cause serious damage to the engine.

condition. In the event of engine malfunction,
particularly involving engine misfire or other
apparent loss of performance, have your vehicle
serviced promptly. Continued operation of your
vehicle with a severe malfunction could cause the
converter to overheat, resulting in possible damage to the converter and vehicle.
Under normal operating conditions, the catalytic converter will not require maintenance. However, it is
important to keep the engine properly tuned to assure
proper catalyst operation and prevent possible catalyst
damage.
NOTE: Intentional tampering with emissions control
systems can result in civil penalties being assessed
against you.
In unusual situations involving grossly malfunctioning
engine operation, a scorching odor may suggest severe
and abnormal catalyst overheating. If this occurs, stop
the vehicle, turn off the engine and allow it to cool.
Service, including a tune-up to manufacturer’s specifications, should be obtained immediately.

To minimize the possibility of catalytic converter damage:
• Do not shut off the engine or interrupt the ignition,
when the transmission is in gear and the vehicle is in
motion.
• Do not try to start the engine by pushing or towing
the vehicle.
• Do not idle the engine with any spark plug wires
disconnected or removed, such as when diagnostic
testing, or for prolonged periods during very rough
idle or malfunctioning operating conditions.

WARNING!
• Turn vehicle off and disconnect the fan motor
lead before working near the radiator cooling fan.
• You or others can be badly burned by hot engine
coolant (antifreeze) or steam from your radiator. If
you see or hear steam coming from under the hood,
do not open the hood until the radiator has had
time to cool. Never open a cooling system pressure
cap when the radiator or coolant bottle is hot.
(Continued)

SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE 217

WARNING! (Continued)
• Keep hands, tools, clothing, and jewelry away
from the radiator cooling fan when the hood is
raised. The fan starts automatically and may start
at any time, whether the engine is running or not.
• When working near the radiator cooling fan,
disconnect the fan motor lead or turn the ignition
switch to the OFF position. The fan is temperature
controlled and can start at any time the ignition
switch is in the ON position.
Coolant Checks
Check engine coolant (antifreeze) protection every 12
months (before the onset of freezing weather, where
applicable). If the engine coolant (antifreeze) is dirty or
rusty in appearance, the system should be drained,
flushed and refilled with fresh engine coolant (antifreeze). Check the front of the A/C condenser for any
accumulation of bugs, leaves, etc. If dirty, clean by
gently spraying water from a garden hose vertically
down the face of the condenser.

Cooling System — Drain, Flush And Refill
NOTE: Some vehicles require special tools to add
coolant properly. Failure to fill these systems properly
could lead to severe internal engine damage. If any
coolant is needed to be added to the system please
contact an authorized dealer.
If the engine coolant (antifreeze) is dirty or contains
visible sediment, have an authorized dealer clean and
flush with OAT coolant (antifreeze) (conforming to
MS.90032).
Refer to the “Maintenance Plan” in this section for the
8
proper maintenance intervals.
Selection Of Coolant
Refer to “Fluids And Lubricants” in “Technical Specifications” for further information.
NOTE:
• Mixing of engine coolant (antifreeze) other than specified Organic Additive Technology (OAT) engine coolant (antifreeze), may result in engine damage and may
decrease corrosion protection. Organic Additive Technology (OAT) engine coolant is different and should

218 SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE

not be mixed with Hybrid Organic Additive Technology (HOAT) engine coolant (antifreeze) or any “globally compatible” coolant (antifreeze). If a non-OAT
engine coolant (antifreeze) is introduced into the cooling system in an emergency, the cooling system will
need to be drained, flushed, and refilled with fresh
OAT coolant (conforming to MS.90032), by an authorized dealer as soon as possible.
• Do not use water alone or alcohol-based engine
coolant (antifreeze) products. Do not use additional
rust inhibitors or antirust products, as they may not
be compatible with the radiator engine coolant and
may plug the radiator.
• This vehicle has not been designed for use with
propylene glycol-based engine coolant (antifreeze).
Use of propylene glycolbased engine coolant (antifreeze) is not recommended.
• Some vehicles require special tools to add coolant
properly. Failure to fill these systems properly could
lead to severe internal engine damage. If any coolant
is needed to be added to the system please contact an
authorized dealer.

Adding Coolant
Your vehicle has been built with an improved engine
coolant (OAT coolant conforming to MS.90032) that
allows extended maintenance intervals. This engine
coolant (antifreeze) can be used up to ten years or
150,000 miles (240,000 km) before replacement. To prevent reducing this extended maintenance period, it is
important that you use the same engine coolant (OAT
coolant conforming to MS.90032) throughout the life of
your vehicle.
Please review these recommendations for using Organic Additive Technology (OAT) engine coolant (antifreeze) that meets the requirements of FCA Material
Standard MS.90032. When adding engine coolant (antifreeze):
• We recommend using Mopar Antifreeze/Coolant 10
Year/150,000 Mile (240,000 km) Formula OAT (Organic Additive Technology) that meets the requirements of FCA Material Standard MS.90032.
• Mix a minimum solution of 50% OAT engine coolant
that meets the requirements of FCA Material Standard MS.90032 and distilled water. Use higher concentrations (not to exceed 70%) if temperatures below

SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE 219

−34°F (−37°C) are anticipated. Please contact an
authorized dealer for assistance.
• Use only high purity water such as distilled or
deionized water when mixing the water/engine
coolant (antifreeze) solution. The use of lower quality
water will reduce the amount of corrosion protection
in the engine cooling system.
NOTE:
• It is the owner’s responsibility to maintain the proper
level of protection against freezing according to the
temperatures occurring in the area where the vehicle
is operated.
• Some vehicles require special tools to add coolant
properly. Failure to fill these systems properly could
lead to severe internal engine damage. If any coolant
is needed to be added to the system, please contact a
local authorized dealer.
• Mixing engine coolant (antifreeze) types is not recommended and can result in cooling system damage.
If HOAT and OAT coolant are mixed in an emergency, have a authorized dealer drain, flush, and
refill with OAT coolant (conforming to MS.90032) as
soon as possible.

Cooling System Pressure Cap
The cap must be fully tightened to prevent loss of
engine coolant (antifreeze), and to ensure that engine
coolant (antifreeze) will return to the radiator from the
coolant expansion bottle/recovery tank if so equipped.
The cap should be inspected and cleaned if there is any
accumulation of foreign material on the sealing surfaces.

WARNING!
• Do not open hot engine cooling system. Never
add engine coolant (antifreeze) when the engine
is overheated. Do not loosen or remove the cap to
cool an overheated engine. Heat causes pressure
to build up in the cooling system. To prevent
scalding or injury, do not remove the pressure cap
while the system is hot or under pressure.
• Do not use a pressure cap other than the one
specified for your vehicle. Personal injury or
engine damage may result.

Disposal Of Used Coolant

Points To Remember

Used ethylene glycol-based coolant (antifreeze) is a
regulated substance requiring proper disposal. Check
with your local authorities to determine the disposal
rules for your community. To prevent ingestion by
animals or children, do not store ethylene glycol-based
coolant in open containers or allow it to remain in
puddles on the ground. If ingested by a child or pet,
seek emergency assistance immediately. Clean up any
ground spills immediately.

NOTE: When the vehicle is stopped after a few miles/
kilometers of operation, you may observe vapor coming
from the front of the engine compartment. This is
normally a result of moisture from rain, snow, or high
humidity accumulating on the radiator and being vaporized when the thermostat opens, allowing hot engine coolant (antifreeze) to enter the radiator.

Coolant Level
The coolant expansion bottle provides a quick visual
method for determining that the coolant level is adequate. With the engine off and cold, the level of the
engine coolant (antifreeze) in the bottle should be
between the “MIN” and “MAX” marks.
As long as the engine operating temperature is satisfactory, the coolant bottle need only be checked once a
month.
When additional engine coolant (antifreeze) is needed
to maintain the proper level, it should be added to the
coolant bottle. Do not overfill.

If an examination of your engine compartment shows
no evidence of radiator or hose leaks, the vehicle may
be safely driven. The vapor will soon dissipate.
• Do not overfill the coolant expansion bottle.
• Check the coolant freeze point in the radiator and in
the coolant expansion bottle. If engine coolant (antifreeze) needs to be added, the contents of the coolant
expansion bottle must also be protected against freezing.
• If frequent engine coolant (antifreeze) additions are
required, the cooling system should be pressure
tested for leaks.
• Maintain engine coolant (antifreeze) concentration at
a minimum of 50% OAT coolant (conforming to

SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE 221

MS.90032) and distilled water for proper corrosion
protection of your engine which contains aluminum
components.
• Make sure that the coolant expansion bottle overflow
hoses are not kinked or obstructed.
• Keep the front of the radiator clean. If your vehicle is
equipped with air conditioning, keep the front of the
condenser clean.
• Do not change the thermostat for Summer or Winter
operation. If replacement is ever necessary, install
ONLY the correct type thermostat. Other designs
may result in unsatisfactory engine coolant (antifreeze) performance, poor gas mileage, and increased
emissions.
Brake System
In order to assure brake system performance, all brake
system components should be inspected periodically.
Refer to the “Maintenance Plan” in this section for the
proper maintenance intervals.

WARNING!
Riding the brakes can lead to brake failure and
possibly a collision. Driving with your foot resting
or riding on the brake pedal can result in abnormally high brake temperatures, excessive lining
wear, and possible brake damage. You would not
have your full braking capacity in an emergency.
Brake Master Cylinder
The fluid level in the master cylinder should be checked
when performing under hood services, or immediately
if the “Brake Warning Light” is on.
8
Be sure to clean the top of the master cylinder area
before removing the cap. If necessary, add fluid to bring
the fluid level up to the requirements described on the
brake fluid reservoir. Fluid level can be expected to fall
as the brake pads wear. The brake fluid level should be
checked when the pads are replaced. However, low
fluid level may be caused by a leak and a checkup may
be needed.

222 SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE

Use only manufacturer’s recommended brake fluid.
Refer to “Fluids And Lubricants ” in “Technical Specifications” for further information.

WARNING!
• Use only manufacturer’s recommended brake
fluid. Refer to “Fluids And Lubricants” in “Technical Specifications” for further information. Using the wrong type of brake fluid can severely
damage your brake system and/or impair its performance. The proper type of brake fluid for your
vehicle is also identified on the original factory
installed hydraulic master cylinder reservoir.
• To avoid contamination from foreign matter or
moisture, use only new brake fluid or fluid that
has been in a tightly closed container. Keep the
master cylinder reservoir cap secured at all times.
Brake fluid in a open container absorbs moisture
from the air resulting in a lower boiling point.
This may cause it to boil unexpectedly during
hard or prolonged braking, resulting in sudden
brake failure. This could result in a collision.
(Continued)

WARNING! (Continued)
• Overfilling the brake fluid reservoir can result in
spilling brake fluid on hot engine parts, causing
the brake fluid to catch fire. Brake fluid can also
damage painted and vinyl surfaces, care should
be taken to avoid its contact with these surfaces.
• Do not allow petroleum based fluid to contaminate the brake fluid. Brake seal components could
be damaged, causing partial or complete brake
failure. This could result in a collision.

CAUTION!
Use of improper brake fluids will affect overall
clutch system performance. Improper brake fluids
may damage the clutch system resulting in loss of
clutch function and the ability to shift the transmission.

Special Additives
The manufacturer strongly recommends against using
any special additives in the transmission.
Transmission fluid is an engineered product and its
performance may be impaired by supplemental additives. Therefore, do not add any fluid additives to the
transmission. The only exception to this policy is the
use of special dyes for diagnosing fluid leaks.

CAUTION!
Do not use chemical flushes in your transmission as
the chemicals can damage your transmission components. Such damage is not covered by the New
Vehicle Limited Warranty.
Fluid Level Check
The fluid level is preset at the factory and does not
require adjustment under normal operating conditions.

Frequent fluid level checks are not required, but have
your authorized dealer check the fluid level as specified
in the Maintenance Schedule to ensure proper transmission function and longevity. The transmission has no
dipstick, but your authorized dealer can check your
transmission fluid level using special service tools. If
you notice fluid leakage or transmission malfunction,
visit your authorized dealer immediately to have the
transmission fluid level checked. Operating the vehicle
with an improper fluid level can cause severe transmission damage.
Fluid Changes
Under normal operating conditions, the fluid installed
at the factory will provide satisfactory lubrication for
the life of the vehicle. However, change the fluid if it
becomes contaminated (with water, etc.), or if the
transmission is disassembled for any reason.

Definition
The vehicle B-Pillar is the structural member of the body located
behind the front door.
Cold tire inflation pressure is defined as the tire pressure after
the vehicle has not been driven for at least three hours, or driven
less than 1 mile (1.6 km) after sitting for a minimum of three
hours. Inflation pressure is measured in units of PSI (pounds per
square inch) or kPa (kilopascals).
The maximum inflation pressure is the maximum permissible
cold tire inflation pressure for this tire. The maximum inflation
pressure is molded into the sidewall.

Tire And Loading Information Placard

Loading
The vehicle maximum load on the tire must not exceed
the load carrying capacity of the tire on your vehicle.
You will not exceed the tire’s load carrying capacity if
you adhere to the loading conditions, tire size, and cold
tire inflation pressures specified on the Tire and Loading Information placard in “Vehicle Loading” in the
“Starting And Operating” section of this manual.
NOTE: Under a maximum loaded vehicle condition,
gross axle weight ratings (GAWRs) for the front and
rear axles must not be exceeded.

Tire And Loading Information Placard

This placard tells you important information about the:
1. Number of people that can be carried in the vehicle.
2. Total weight your vehicle can carry.
3. Tire size designed for your vehicle.
4. Cold tire inflation pressures for the front, rear, and
spare tires.

For further information on GAWRs, vehicle loading,
and trailer towing, refer to “Vehicle Loading” in the
“Starting And Operating” section of this manual.
To determine the maximum loading conditions of your
vehicle, locate the statement “The combined weight of
occupants and cargo should never exceed XXX kg or
XXX lbs” on the Tire and Loading Information placard.
The combined weight of occupants, cargo/luggage and
trailer tongue weight (if applicable) should never exceed the weight referenced here.

SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE 233

Steps For Determining Correct Load Limit—
(1) Locate the statement “The combined weight of
occupants and cargo should never exceed XXX kg or
XXX lbs.” on your vehicle’s placard.
(2) Determine the combined weight of the driver and
passengers that will be riding in your vehicle.
(3) Subtract the combined weight of the driver and
passengers from XXX kg or XXX lbs.
(4) The resulting figure equals the available amount
of cargo and luggage load capacity. For example, if
“XXX” amount equals 1400 lbs. and there will be five
150 lb passengers in your vehicle, the amount of
available cargo and luggage load capacity is 650 lbs.
(1400-750 (5x150) = 650 lbs.)
(5) Determine the combined weight of luggage and
cargo being loaded on the vehicle. That weight may
not safely exceed the available cargo and luggage
load capacity calculated in Step 4.
(6) If your vehicle will be towing a trailer, load from
your trailer will be transferred to your vehicle.

Consult this manual to determine how this reduces
the available cargo and luggage load capacity of your
vehicle.
Metric Example For Load Limit
For example, if “XXX” amount equals 635 kg and there
will be five 68 kg passengers in your vehicle, the
amount of available cargo and luggage load capacity is
295 kg (635-340 (5x68) = 295 kg) as shown in step 4.
NOTE:
• If your vehicle will be towing a trailer, load from
your trailer will be transferred to your vehicle. The
8
following table shows examples on how to calculate
total load, cargo/luggage, and towing capacities of
your vehicle with varying seating configurations and
number and size of occupants. This table is for
illustration purposes only and may not be accurate
for the seating and load carry capacity of your
vehicle.
• For the following example, the combined weight of
occupants and cargo should never exceed 865 lbs
(392 kg).

234 SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE

WARNING!
Overloading of your tires is dangerous. Overloading can cause tire failure, affect vehicle handling,
and increase your stopping distance. Use tires of the
recommended load capacity for your vehicle. Never
overload them.

Tires — General Information
Tire Pressure
Proper tire inflation pressure is essential to the safe and
satisfactory operation of your vehicle. Four primary
areas are affected by improper tire pressure:
• Safety and Vehicle Stability
• Economy

SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE 235

• Tread Wear

Both under-inflation and over-inflation affect the stability of the vehicle and can produce a feeling of sluggish
response or over responsiveness in the steering.

• Ride Comfort
Safety

NOTE:

WARNING!
• Improperly inflated tires are dangerous and can
cause collisions.
• Underinflation increases tire flexing and can result in overheating and tire failure.
• Overinflation reduces a tire’s ability to cushion
shock. Objects on the road and chuckholes can
cause damage that result in tire failure.
• Overinflated or underinflated tires can affect vehicle handling and can fail suddenly, resulting in
loss of vehicle control.
• Unequal tire pressures can cause steering problems. You could lose control of your vehicle.
• Unequal tire pressures from one side of the vehicle to the other can cause the vehicle to drift to
the right or left.
• Always drive with each tire inflated to the recommended cold tire inflation pressure.

• Unequal tire pressures from side to side may cause
erratic and unpredictable steering response.
• Unequal tire pressure from side to side may cause the
vehicle to drift left or right.
Fuel Economy
Underinflated tires will increase tire rolling resistance
resulting in higher fuel consumption.
8
Tread Wear
Improper cold tire inflation pressures can cause abnormal wear patterns and reduced tread life, resulting in
the need for earlier tire replacement.
Ride Comfort And Vehicle Stability
Proper tire inflation contributes to a comfortable ride.
Over-inflation produces a jarring and uncomfortable
ride.

236 SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE

Tire Inflation Pressures
The proper cold tire inflation pressure is listed on the
driver’s side B-Pillar or rear edge of the driver’s side
door.
At least once a month:
• Check and adjust tire pressure with a good quality
pocket-type pressure gauge. Do not make a visual
judgement when determining proper inflation. Tires
may look properly inflated even when they are
under-inflated.
• Inspect tires for signs of tire wear or visible damage.

CAUTION!
After inspecting or adjusting the tire pressure,
always reinstall the valve stem cap. This will prevent moisture and dirt from entering the valve stem,
which could damage the valve stem.
Inflation pressures specified on the placard are always
“cold tire inflation pressure”. Cold tire inflation pressure is defined as the tire pressure after the vehicle has
not been driven for at least three hours, or driven less
than 1 mile (1.6 km) after sitting for a minimum of three

hours. The cold tire inflation pressure must not exceed
the maximum inflation pressure molded into the tire
sidewall.
Check tire pressures more often if subject to a wide
range of outdoor temperatures, as tire pressures vary
with temperature changes.
Tire pressures change by approximately 1 psi (7 kPa)
per 12°F (7°C) of air temperature change. Keep this in
mind when checking tire pressure inside a garage,
especially in the Winter.
Example: If garage temperature = 68°F (20°C) and the
outside temperature = 32°F (0°C) then the cold tire
inflation pressure should be increased by 3 psi (21 kPa),
which equals 1 psi (7 kPa) for every 12°F (7°C) for this
outside temperature condition.
Tire pressure may increase from 2 to 6 psi (13 to 40 kPa)
during operation. DO NOT reduce this normal pressure
build up or your tire pressure will be too low.
Tire Pressures For High Speed Operation
The manufacturer advocates driving at safe speeds and
within posted speed limits. Where speed limits or
conditions are such that the vehicle can be driven at
high speeds, maintaining correct tire inflation pressure

SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE 237

is very important. Increased tire pressure and reduced
vehicle loading may be required for high-speed vehicle
operation. Refer to an authorized tire dealer or original
equipment vehicle dealer for recommended safe operating speeds, loading and cold tire inflation pressures.

WARNING!
High speed driving with your vehicle under maximum load is dangerous. The added strain on your
tires could cause them to fail. You could have a
serious collision. Do not drive a vehicle loaded to
the maximum capacity at continuous speeds above
75 mph (120 km/h).
Radial Ply Tires

WARNING!
Combining radial ply tires with other types of tires
on your vehicle will cause your vehicle to handle
poorly. The instability could cause a collision. Always use radial ply tires in sets of four. Never
combine them with other types of tires.

Tire Repair
If your tire becomes damaged, it may be repaired if it
meets the following criteria:
• The tire has not been driven on when flat.
• The damage is only on the tread section of your tire
(sidewall damage is not repairable).
• The puncture is no greater than a ¼ of an inch (6 mm).
Consult an authorized tire dealer for tire repairs and
additional information.
Damaged Run Flat tires, or Run Flat tires that have
experienced a loss of pressure should be replaced 8
immediately with another Run Flat tire of identical size
and service description (Load Index and Speed Symbol). Replace the tire pressure sensor as well as it is not
designed to be reused.
Run Flat Tires — If Equipped
Run Flat tires allow you the capability to drive 50 miles
(80 km) at 50 mph (80 km/h) after a rapid loss of
inflation pressure. This rapid loss of inflation is referred
to as the Run Flat mode. A Run Flat mode occurs when
the tire inflation pressure is of/or below 14 psi (96 kPa).
Once a Run Flat tire reaches the run flat mode it has

238 SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE

limited driving capabilities and needs to be replaced
immediately. A Run Flat tire is not repairable. When a
run flat tire is changed after driving with underinflated
tire condition, please replace the TPM sensor as it is not
designed to be reused when driven under run flat mode
(14 psi (96 kPa)) condition.
NOTE: TPM Sensor must be replaced after driving the
vehicle on a flat tire condition.
It is not recommended driving a vehicle loaded at full
capacity or to tow a trailer while a tire is in the run flat
mode.
See the tire pressure monitoring section for more information.

Tire Spinning
When stuck in mud, sand, snow, or ice conditions, do
not spin your vehicle’s wheels above 30 mph (48 km/h)
or for longer than 30 seconds continuously without
stopping.
Refer to “Freeing A Stuck Vehicle” in “In Case Of
Emergency” for further information.

WARNING!
Fast spinning tires can be dangerous. Forces generated by excessive wheel speeds may cause tire
damage or failure. A tire could explode and injure
someone. Do not spin your vehicle’s wheels faster
than 30 mph (48 km/h) for more than 30 seconds
continuously when you are stuck, and do not let
anyone near a spinning wheel, no matter what the
speed.

SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE 239

Tread Wear Indicators
Tread wear indicators are in the original equipment
tires to help you in determining when your tires should
be replaced.

Refer to “Replacement Tires” in this section for further
information.
Life Of Tire
The service life of a tire is dependent upon varying
factors including, but not limited to:
• Driving style.
• Tire pressure - Improper cold tire inflation pressures
can cause uneven wear patterns to develop across the
tire tread. These abnormal wear patterns will reduce
tread life, resulting in the need for earlier tire replacement.
• Distance driven.

Tire Tread
1 — Worn Tire
2 — New Tire

These indicators are molded into the bottom of the tread
grooves. They will appear as bands when the tread
depth becomes a 1/16 of an inch (1.6 mm). When the
tread is worn to the tread wear indicators, the tire
should be replaced.

• Performance tires, tires with a speed rating of V or
higher, and Summer tires typically have a reduced
tread life. Rotation of these tires per the vehicle
scheduled maintenance is highly recommended.

WARNING!
Tires and the spare tire should be replaced after six
years, regardless of the remaining tread. Failure to
(Continued)

240 SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE

WARNING! (Continued)
follow this warning can result in sudden tire failure. You could lose control and have a collision
resulting in serious injury or death.
NOTE: Wheel Valve Stem must be replaced as well
when installing new tires due to wear and tear in
existing tires.
Keep dismounted tires in a cool, dry place with as little
exposure to light as possible. Protect tires from contact
with oil, grease, and gasoline.
Replacement Tires
The tires on your new vehicle provide a balance of many
characteristics. They should be inspected regularly for
wear and correct cold tire inflation pressures. The manufacturer strongly recommends that you use tires equivalent to the originals in size, quality and performance
when replacement is needed. Refer to the paragraph on
“Tread Wear Indicators” in this section. Refer to the Tire
and Loading Information placard or the Vehicle Certification Label for the size designation of your tire. The
Load Index and Speed Symbol for your tire will be found
on the original equipment tire sidewall.

See the Tire Sizing Chart example found in the “Tire
Safety Information” section of this manual for more
information relating to the Load Index and Speed
Symbol of a tire.
It is recommended to replace the two front tires or two
rear tires as a pair. Replacing just one tire can seriously
affect your vehicle’s handling. If you ever replace a
wheel, make sure that the wheel’s specifications match
those of the original wheels.
It is recommended you contact an authorized tire dealer
or original equipment dealer with any questions you
may have on tire specifications or capability. Failure to
use equivalent replacement tires may adversely affect
the safety, handling, and ride of your vehicle.

WARNING!
• Do not use a tire, wheel size, load rating, or speed
rating other than that specified for your vehicle.
Some combinations of unapproved tires and
wheels may change suspension dimensions and
performance characteristics, resulting in changes
to steering, handling, and braking of your vehicle.
(Continued)

SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE 241

WARNING! (Continued)
This can cause unpredictable handling and stress
to steering and suspension components. You
could lose control and have a collision resulting
in serious injury or death. Use only the tire and
wheel sizes with load ratings approved for your
vehicle.
• Never use a tire with a smaller load index or
capacity, other than what was originally equipped
on your vehicle. Using a tire with a smaller load
index could result in tire overloading and failure.
You could lose control and have a collision.
• Failure to equip your vehicle with tires having
adequate speed capability can result in sudden
tire failure and loss of vehicle control.

CAUTION!
Replacing original tires with tires of a different size
may result in false speedometer and odometer readings.

Tire Types
All Season Tires — If Equipped
All Season tires provide traction for all seasons (Spring,
Summer, Fall, and Winter). Traction levels may vary
between different all season tires. All season tires can be
identified by the M+S, M&S, M/S or MS designation on
the tire sidewall. Use all season tires only in sets of four;
failure to do so may adversely affect the safety and
handling of your vehicle.
Summer Or Three Season Tires — If Equipped
Summer tires provide traction in both wet and dry
conditions, and are not intended to be driven in snow or 8
on ice. If your vehicle is equipped with Summer tires, be
aware these tires are not designed for Winter or cold
driving conditions. Install Winter tires on your vehicle
when ambient temperatures are less than 40°F (5°C) or
if roads are covered with ice or snow. For more information, contact an authorized dealer.
Summer tires do not contain the all season designation
or mountain/snowflake symbol on the tire sidewall.
Use Summer tires only in sets of four; failure to do so

may adversely affect the safety and handling of your
vehicle.

to original equipment or an authorized tire dealer for
recommended safe operating speeds, loading and cold
tire inflation pressures.

WARNING!

While studded tires improve performance on ice, skid
and traction capability on wet or dry surfaces may be
poorer than that of non-studded tires. Some states
prohibit studded tires; therefore, local laws should be
checked before using these tire types.

Do not use Summer tires in snow/ice conditions.
You could lose vehicle control, resulting in severe
injury or death. Driving too fast for conditions also
creates the possibility of loss of vehicle control.

Spare Tires — If Equipped

Snow Tires
Some areas of the country require the use of snow tires
during the Winter. Snow tires can be identified by a
“mountain/snowflake” symbol on the tire sidewall.
If you need snow tires, select tires
equivalent in size and type to the
original equipment tires. Use snow
tires only in sets of four; failure to do
so may adversely affect the safety
and handling of your vehicle.
Snow tires generally have lower speed ratings than
what was originally equipped with your vehicle and
should not be operated at sustained speeds over 75 mph
(120 km/h). For speeds above 75 mph (120 km/h) refer

NOTE: For vehicles equipped with Tire Service Kit
instead of a spare tire, please refer to “Tire Service Kit”
in “In Case Of Emergency” for further information.

CAUTION!
Because of the reduced ground clearance, do not
take your vehicle through an automatic car wash
with a compact or limited use temporary spare
installed. Damage to the vehicle may result.
Refer to the “Towing Requirements - Tires” in “Starting
And Operating” for restrictions when towing with a

tire rotation for your vehicle. If your vehicle has this
option, refer to an authorized tire dealer for the recommended tire rotation pattern.
Compact Spare Tire — If Equipped
The compact spare is for temporary emergency use
only. You can identify if your vehicle is equipped with
a compact spare by looking at the spare tire description
on the Tire and Loading Information Placard located on
the driver’s side door opening or on the sidewall of the
tire. Compact spare tire descriptions begin with the
letter “T” or “S” preceding the size designation. Example: T145/80D18 103M.
T, S = Temporary Spare Tire
Since this tire has limited tread life, the original equipment tire should be repaired (or replaced) and reinstalled on your vehicle at the first opportunity.

Do not install a wheel cover or attempt to mount a
conventional tire on the compact spare wheel, since the
wheel is designed specifically for the compact spare
tire. Do not install more than one compact spare tire and
wheel on the vehicle at any given time.

WARNING!
Compact and collapsible spares are for temporary
emergency use only. With these spares, do not drive
more than 50 mph (80 km/h). Temporary use spares
have limited tread life. When the tread is worn to
the tread wear indicators, the temporary use spare
tire needs to be replaced. Be sure to follow the
warnings, which apply to your spare. Failure to do
so could result in spare tire failure and loss of
vehicle control.
Collapsible Spare Tire — If Equipped
The collapsible spare is for temporary emergency use
only. You can identify if your vehicle is equipped with
a collapsible spare by looking at the spare tire description on the Tire and Loading Information Placard

WARNING!
Compact and Collapsible spares are for temporary
emergency use only. With these spares, do not drive
more than 50 mph (80 km/h). Temporary use spares
have limited tread life. When the tread is worn to
the tread wear indicators, the temporary use spare
tire needs to be replaced. Be sure to follow the
warnings, which apply to your spare. Failure to do
so could result in spare tire failure and loss of
vehicle control.

Full Size Spare — If Equipped
The full size spare is for temporary emergency use only.
This tire may look like the originally equipped tire on
the front or rear axle of your vehicle, but it is not. This
spare tire may have limited tread life. When the tread is
worn to the tread wear indicators, the temporary use
full size spare tire needs to be replaced. Since it is not
the same as your original equipment tire, replace (or
repair) the original equipment tire and reinstall on the
vehicle at the first opportunity.
Limited Use Spare — If Equipped
The limited use spare tire is for temporary emergency
use only. This tire is identified by a label located on the
limited use spare wheel. This label contains the driving
limitations for this spare. This tire may look like the
original equipped tire on the front or rear axle of your
vehicle, but it is not. Installation of this limited use
spare tire affects vehicle handling. Since it is not the
same as your original equipment tire, replace (or repair)
the original equipment tire and reinstall on the vehicle
at the first opportunity.

SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE 245

WARNING!
Limited use spares are for emergency use only.
Installation of this limited use spare tire affects
vehicle handling. With this tire, do not drive more
than the speed listed on the limited use spare
wheel. Keep inflated to the cold tire inflation pressures listed on your Tire and Loading Information
Placard located on the driver’s side B-Pillar or the
rear edge of the driver’s side door. Replace (or
repair) the original equipment tire at the first opportunity and reinstall it on your vehicle. Failure to
do so could result in loss of vehicle control.
Wheel And Wheel Trim Care
All wheels and wheel trim, especially aluminum and
chrome plated wheels, should be cleaned regularly
using mild (neutral Ph) soap and water to maintain
their luster and to prevent corrosion. Wash wheels with
the same soap solution recommended for the body of
the vehicle and remember to always wash when the
surfaces are not hot to the touch.

Your wheels are susceptible to deterioration caused by
salt, sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium
chloride, etc., and other road chemicals used to melt ice
or control dust on dirt roads. Use a soft cloth or sponge
and mild soap to wipe away promptly. Do not use harsh
chemicals or a stiff brush. They can damage the wheel’s
protective coating that helps keep them from corroding
and tarnishing.

CAUTION!
Avoid products or automatic car washes that use
acidic solutions or strong alkaline additives or
harsh brushes. Many aftermarket wheel cleaners
and automatic car washes may damage the wheel’s
protective finish. Such damage is not covered by the
New Vehicle Limited Warranty. Only car wash soap
is recommended.

8

246 SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE

When cleaning extremely dirty wheels including excessive brake dust, care must be taken in the selection of
tire and wheel cleaning chemicals and equipment to
prevent damage to the wheels. Select a non-abrasive,
non-acidic cleaner for aluminum or chrome wheels.

CAUTION!
Do not use scouring pads, steel wool, a bristle
brush, metal polishes or oven cleaner. These products may damage the wheel’s protective finish.
Such damage is not covered by the New Vehicle
Limited Warranty. Only car wash soap is recommended.
NOTE: If you intend parking or storing your vehicle for
an extended period after cleaning the wheels with
wheel cleaner, drive your vehicle and apply the brakes
to remove the water droplets from the brake components. This activity will remove the red rust on the
brake rotors and prevent vehicle vibration when braking.

Dark Or Low Gloss Wheels

CAUTION!
If your vehicle is equipped with these specialty
wheels, DO NOT USE wheel cleaners, abrasives, or
polishing compounds. They will permanently damage this finish and such damage is not covered by
the New Vehicle Limited Warranty. HAND WASH
ONLY USING MILD SOAP AND WATER WITH A
SOFT CLOTH. Used on a regular basis; this is all
that is required to maintain this finish.
Tire Chains (Traction Devices)
Use of traction devices require sufficient tire-to-body
clearance. Follow these recommendations to guard
against damage.
• Traction device must be of proper size for the tire, as
recommended by the traction device manufacturer.
• Install on Rear Tires Only.
• Reduced size snow chains with a maximum projection of 7 mm beyond the tire profile can be fitted on
vehicles equipped with 235/40 R18 rear tire.

SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE 247

CAUTION!
To avoid damage to your vehicle or tires, observe
the following precautions:
• Because of restricted traction device clearance
between tires and other suspension components,
it is important that only traction devices in good
condition are used. Broken devices can cause
serious damage. Stop the vehicle immediately if
noise occurs that could indicate device breakage.
Remove the damaged parts of the device before
further use.
• Install device as tightly as possible and then
retighten after driving about ½ mile (0.8 km).
• Do not exceed 30 mph (48 km/h).
• Drive cautiously and avoid severe turns and large
bumps, especially with a loaded vehicle.
• Do not drive for prolonged period on dry pavement.
• Observe the traction device manufacturer’s instructions on the method of installation, operating speed, and conditions for use. Always use the
suggested operating speed of the device manufacturer’s if it is less than 30 mph (48 km/h).
• Do not use traction devices on a compact spare tire.

Tire Rotation Recommendations
Due to tire design and size, tire rotations on this vehicle
are not possible.
NOTE: For AR 4C models, where available, the vehicle
may be equipped with high performance tires that
guarantee high grip performance with little increase of
wear. Alfa Romeo, in collaboration with Pirelli, developed a specific high performance tire for the 4C model.
A dedicated Pirelli PZero, identified with an AR mark,
guarantees this vehicle to obtain the highest performance capable.
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION UNIFORM
TIRE QUALITY GRADES
The following tire grading categories were established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The specific grade rating assigned by
the tire’s manufacturer in each category is shown on
the sidewall of the tires on your vehicle.
All passenger vehicle tires must conform to Federal
safety requirements in addition to these grades.

8

248 SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE

Treadwear
The Treadwear grade is a comparative rating, based
on the wear rate of the tire when tested under
controlled conditions on a specified government test
course. For example, a tire graded 150 would wear
one and one-half times as well on the government
course as a tire graded 100. The relative performance
of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their
use, however, and may depart significantly from the
norm due to variations in driving habits, service
practices, and differences in road characteristics and
climate.
Traction Grades
The Traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA,
A, B, and C. These grades represent the tire’s ability
to stop on wet pavement, as measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. A tire marked C may
have poor traction performance.

WARNING!
The traction grade assigned to this tire is based
on straight-ahead braking traction tests, and does
not include acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning, or peak traction characteristics.
Temperature Grades
The Temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C,
representing the tire’s resistance to the generation of
heat and its ability to dissipate heat, when tested
under controlled conditions on a specified indoor
laboratory test wheel.
Sustained high temperature can cause the material of
the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and
excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure.
The grade C corresponds to a level of performance,
which all passenger vehicle tires must meet under
the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 109.
Grades B and A represent higher levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel, than the minimum required by law.

SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE 249

WARNING!
The temperature grade for this tire is established
for a tire that is properly inflated and not overloaded. Excessive speed, under-inflation, or excessive loading, either separately or in combination, can cause heat buildup and possible tire
failure.
VEHICLE STORAGE
If you are leaving your vehicle dormant for more than
21 days, you may want to take these steps to protect
your battery.
• Disconnect the negative cable from the battery.
• Anytime you store your vehicle, or keep it out of
service (e.g., vacation) for two weeks or more, run the
air conditioning system at idle for about five minutes
in the fresh air and high blower setting. This will
ensure adequate system lubrication to minimize the
possibility of compressor damage when the system is
started again.

BODYWORK
Protection From Atmospheric Agents
Vehicle body care requirements vary according to geographic locations and usage. Chemicals that make roads
passable in snow and ice and those that are sprayed on
trees and road surfaces during other seasons are highly
corrosive to the metal in your vehicle. Outside parking,
which exposes your vehicle to airborne contaminants,
road surfaces on which the vehicle is operated, extreme
hot or cold weather and other extreme conditions will
have an adverse effect on paint, metal trim, and underbody protection.
The following maintenance recommendations will enable you to obtain maximum benefit from the corrosion
resistance built into your vehicle.

250 SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE

What Causes Corrosion?
Corrosion is the result of deterioration or removal of
paint and protective coatings from your vehicle.

Do not use abrasive cleaning components, solvents,
steel wool or other aggressive material to clean the
lenses.

The most common causes are:

Preserving The Bodywork

• Road salt, dirt and moisture accumulation.

Washing

• Stone and gravel impact.
• Insects, tree sap and tar.
• Salt in the air near seacoast localities.
• Atmospheric fallout/industrial pollutants.
Body And Underbody Maintenance
Cleaning Headlights
Your vehicle is equipped with plastic headlights and
fog lights that are lighter and less susceptible to stone
breakage than glass headlights.
Plastic is not as scratch resistant as glass and therefore
different lens cleaning procedures must be followed.
To minimize the possibility of scratching the lenses and
reducing light output, avoid wiping with a dry cloth. To
remove road dirt, wash with a mild soap solution
followed by rinsing.

• Wash your vehicle regularly. Always wash your
vehicle in the shade using Mopar Car Wash, or a mild
car wash soap, and rinse the panels completely with
clear water.
• If insects, tar, or other similar deposits have accumulated on your vehicle, use Mopar Super Kleen Bug
and Tar Remover to remove.
• Use a high quality cleaner wax, such as Mopar
Cleaner Wax to remove road film, stains, and to
protect your paint finish. Take care never to scratch
the paint.
• Avoid using abrasive compounds and power buffing
that may diminish the gloss or thin out the paint
finish.
NOTE: Hand washing is recommended. Avoid washing
with power washers and do not use commercial car
wash facilities.

SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE 251

CAUTION!
• Do not use abrasive or strong cleaning materials
such as steel wool or scouring powder that will
scratch metal and painted surfaces.
• Use of power washers exceeding 1,200 psi
(8 274 kPa) can result in damage or removal of
paint and decals.
• If the engine compartment is washed with an
high pressure jet, keep it at a distance of at least
8 inches (20 centimeters) from filler surface.
• Do not run this vehicle through an Automatic Car
Wash facility as extensive damage can result due
to the vehicle’s low ground clearance.
Special Care
• If you drive on salted or dusty roads or if you drive
near the ocean, hose off the undercarriage at least
once a month.
• It is important that the drain holes in the lower edges
of the doors, rocker panels, and trunk be kept clear
and open.

• If you detect any stone chips or scratches in the paint,
touch them up immediately. The cost of such repairs
is considered the responsibility of the owner.
• If your vehicle is damaged due to a collision or
similar cause that destroys the paint and protective
coating, have your vehicle repaired as soon as possible. The cost of such repairs is considered the
responsibility of the owner.
• If you carry special cargo such as chemicals, fertilizers, de-icer salt, etc., be sure that such materials are
well packaged and sealed.
• If a lot of driving is done on gravel roads, consider 8
mud or stone shields behind each wheel.
• Use Mopar Touch Up Paint on scratches as soon as
possible. An authorized dealer has touch up paint to
match the color of your vehicle.

INTERIORS
Seats And Fabric Parts
Use Mopar Total Clean to clean fabric upholstery and
carpeting.

WARNING!
Do not use volatile solvents for cleaning purposes.
Many are potentially flammable, and if used in
closed areas they may cause respiratory harm.
Seat Belt Maintenance
Do not bleach, dye, or clean the belts with chemical
solvents or abrasive cleaners. This will weaken the
fabric. Sun damage can also weaken the fabric.
If the belts need cleaning, use Mopar Total Clean, a mild
soap solution, or lukewarm water. Do not remove the
belts from the vehicle to wash them. Dry with a soft
cloth.
Replace the belts if they appear frayed or worn or if the
buckles do not work properly.

NOTE: If the belts retract slowly, inspect the upper
turning loop for soiling. If soiling is present, clean with
a wet soft cloth until all residue is removed.

WARNING!
A frayed or torn belt could rip apart in a collision
and leave you with no protection. Inspect the belt
system periodically, checking for cuts, frays, or
loose parts. Damaged parts must be replaced immediately. Do not disassemble or modify the system.
Seat belt assemblies must be replaced after a collision if they have been damaged (i.e., bent retractor,
torn webbing, etc.).
Plastic And Coated Parts
Use Mopar Total Clean to clean vinyl upholstery.

VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER

BRAKE SYSTEM

The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is found on
the left front corner of the instrument panel, visible
through the windshield. This number also appears
engraved on an Aluminum plate glued and riveted on
the floor crossmember under the passenger seat.

Your vehicle is equipped with dual hydraulic brake
systems. If either of the two hydraulic systems loses
normal capability, the remaining system will still function. However, there will be some loss of overall braking effectiveness. You may notice increased pedal travel
during application, greater pedal force required to slow
or stop, and potential activation of the “Brake System
Warning Light”.
In the event power assist is lost for any reason (i.e.,
repeated brake applications with the engine off), the
brakes will still function. However, the effort required
to brake the vehicle will be much greater than that
required with the power system operating.
WHEEL AND TIRE TORQUE SPECIFICATIONS

Vehicle Identification Number

NOTE: It is illegal to remove or alter the VIN.

Proper lug nut/bolt torque is very important to ensure
that the wheel is properly mounted to the vehicle. Any
time a wheel has been removed and reinstalled on the
vehicle, the lug nuts/bolts should be torqued using a
properly calibrated torque wrench using a high quality
six sided (hex) deep wall socket.

WARNING!
To avoid the risk of forcing the vehicle off the jack,
do not tighten the lug nuts/bolts fully until the
vehicle has been lowered. Failure to follow this
warning may result in personal injury.
FUEL REQUIREMENTS — 1750 TURBO
The 1750 turbo engine is designed to
meet all emissions regulations and provide excellent fuel economy and performance when using high-quality premium
unleaded gasoline with an octane rating
of only 91 or higher.
Light spark knock at low engine speeds is not harmful
to your engine. However, continued heavy spark knock
at high speeds can cause damage and immediate service is required.
Poor quality gasoline can cause problems such as hard
starting, stalling and hesitations. If you experience these
symptoms, try another brand of gasoline (with the
appropriate octane rating for your engine) before considering service for the vehicle.

Reformulated Gasoline
Many areas of the country require the use of cleaner
burning gasoline referred to as “Reformulated Gasoline”. Reformulated gasoline contains oxygenates and
are specifically blended to reduce vehicle emissions and
improve air quality.
The use of reformulated gasoline is recommended.
Properly blended reformulated gasoline will provide
improved performance and durability of engine and
fuel system components.
Materials Added To Fuel
Besides using unleaded gasoline with the proper octane
rating, gasolines that contain detergents, corrosion and
stability additives are recommended. Using gasolines
that have these additives will help improve fuel
economy, reduce emissions, and maintain vehicle performance.
Designated TOP TIER Detergent
Gasoline contains a higher level of
detergents to further aide in minimizing engine and fuel system deposits. When available, the usage of

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS 259

TOP TIER Detergent gasoline is recommended. Visit
www.toptiergas.com for a list of TOP TIER Detergent
Gasoline Retailers.
Indiscriminate use of fuel system cleaning agents
should be avoided. Many of these materials intended
for gum and varnish removal may contain active solvents or similar ingredients. These can harm fuel system gasket and diaphragm materials.
Gasoline/Oxygenate Blends
Some fuel suppliers blend unleaded gasoline with
oxygenates such as ethanol.

CAUTION!
DO NOT use gasoline containing methanol or gasoline containing more than 10% ethanol (E-10). Use
of these blends may result in starting and drivability problems, damage critical fuel system components, cause emissions to exceed the applicable
standard, and/or cause the “Malfunction Indicator
Light” to illuminate. Please observe pump labels as
they should clearly communicate if a fuel contains
greater than 10% ethanol (E-10).

Problems that result from using gasoline containing
more than 10% ethanol (E-10) or gasoline containing
methanol are not the responsibility of the manufacturer
and may void or not be covered under New Vehicle
Limited Warranty.
E-85 Usage In Non-Flex Fuel Vehicles
Non-Flex Fuel Vehicles (FFV) are compatible with gasoline containing up to 10% ethanol (E-10). Gasoline with
higher ethanol content may void the New Vehicle
Limited Warranty.
If a Non-FFV vehicle is inadvertently fueled with E-85
fuel, the engine will have some or all of these symptoms:
• Operate in a lean mode.
• OBD II “Malfunction Indicator Light” on.
• Poor engine performance.
• Poor cold start and cold drivability.
• Increased risk for fuel system component corrosion.

9

260 TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

CNG And LP Fuel System Modifications
Modifications that allow the engine to run on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or Liquid Propane (LP)
may result in damage to the engine, emissions, and fuel
system components. Problems that result from running
CNG or LP are not the responsibility of the manufacturer and may void or not be covered under the New
Vehicle Limited Warranty.
MMT In Gasoline
Methylcyclopentadienyl
Manganese
Tricarbonyl
(MMT) is a manganese-containing metallic additive
that is blended into some gasoline to increase octane.
Gasoline blended with MMT provides no performance
advantage beyond gasoline of the same octane number
without MMT. Gasoline blended with MMT reduces
spark plug life and reduces emissions system performance in some vehicles. The manufacturer recommends that gasoline without MMT be used in your
vehicle. The MMT content of gasoline may not be
indicated on the gasoline pump; therefore, you should
ask your gasoline retailer whether the gasoline contains
MMT. MMT is prohibited in Federal and California
reformulated gasoline.

Fuel System Cautions

CAUTION!
Follow these guidelines to maintain your vehicle’s
performance:
• The use of leaded gasoline is prohibited by Federal law. Using leaded gasoline can impair engine
performance and damage the emissions control
system.
• An out-of-tune engine or certain fuel or ignition
malfunctions can cause the catalytic converter to
overheat. If you notice a pungent burning odor or
some light smoke, your engine may be out of tune
or malfunctioning and may require immediate
service. Contact an authorized dealer for service
assistance.
• The use of fuel additives, which are now being
sold as octane enhancers, is not recommended.
Most of these products contain high concentrations of methanol. Fuel system damage or vehicle
performance problems resulting from the use of
such fuels or additives is not the responsibility of
the manufacturer and may void or not be covered
under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS 261

NOTE: Intentional tampering with the emissions control system can result in civil penalties being assessed
against you.

WARNING! (Continued)
a garage, and never sit in a parked vehicle with
the engine running for an extended period. If the
vehicle is stopped in an open area with the engine
running for more than a short period, adjust the
ventilation system to force fresh, outside air into

• Guard against carbon monoxide with proper
maintenance. Have the exhaust system inspected
every time the vehicle is raised. Have any abnormal conditions repaired promptly. Until repaired,
drive with all side windows fully open.

Carbon Monoxide Warnings

WARNING!
Carbon monoxide (CO) in exhaust gases is deadly.

INSTALLATION OF RADIO TRANSMITTING
EQUIPMENT

Mobile radio equipment with output power greater than
normal may require special precautions.

Special design considerations are incorporated into this
vehicle’s electronic system to provide immunity to radio
frequency signals. Mobile two-way radios and telephone
equipment must be installed properly by trained personnel. The following must be observed during installation.

All installations should be checked for possible interference between the communications equipment and the
vehicle’s electronic systems.

The positive power connection should be made directly
to the battery and fused as close to the battery as possible.
The negative power connection should be made to body
sheet metal adjacent to the negative battery connection.
This connection should not be fused.

Operating, servicing and maintaining a
passenger vehicle or off-road highway
motor vehicle can expose you to chemicals
including engine exhaust, carbon monoxide,
phthalates, and lead, which are known to
the State of California to cause cancer and
birth defects or other reproductive harm.
To minimize exposure, avoid breathing
exhaust, do not idle the engine except as
necessary, service your vehicle in a
well-ventilated area and wear gloves or
wash your hands frequently when servicing
your vehicle. For more information go to
www.P65Warnings.ca.gov/passenger-vehicle.

Antennas for two-way radios should be mounted on the
roof or the rear area of the vehicle. Care should be used
in mounting antennas with magnet bases. Magnets may
affect the accuracy or operation of the compass on
vehicles so equipped.
The antenna cable should be as short as practical and
routed away from the vehicle wiring when possible. Use
only fully shielded coaxial cable.
Carefully match the antenna and cable to the radio to
ensure a low Standing Wave Ratio (SWR).
